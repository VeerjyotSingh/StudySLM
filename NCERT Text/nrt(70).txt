FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This
principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home
and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in
the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by
engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the Advisory
Group in Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan, the Chief Advisor,
History, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya and the Advisor for this book,
Professor Narayani Gupta, for guiding the work of this committee. Several
teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful
to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the
institutions and organisations, which have generously permitted us to
draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially
2015-16(20/01/2015)
grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed
by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri
and Professor G. P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As
an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement
in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions
which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

ON READING WORLD HISTORY
How is it possible, you may ask, to study the history of the world within one
year? There is so much that has happened in different countries and so
much that has been written about each country. How can we choose a few
themes for study from a vast and boundless corpus?
These are valid questions. Before we read any book on world history we
need answers to such questions. A syllabus needs to make clear how it is
organised. A book should explain what it is seeking to do.
We need to remember that in studying or writing history the historian is
always involved in a process of selection. This is a point that E. H. Carr
made many decades ago in a wonderful small book What is History? After
wading through an enormous pile of records in a musty archive, a historian
notes down those facts which appear important to him. He relates them to
other evidence that he has similarly collected from some other archive, from
some other place. He cannot possibly copy down everything he has read,
nor use all the evidence he has collected. The evidence that does not make
sense to the historian goes unnoticed. At a later date, some other historian
reads the same records with new questions in mind. She now discovers
evidence that had earlier gone unnoticed. She interprets this evidence, makes
new connections, and writes a new book of history.
History writing cannot do away with this element of selectivity. So in
reading history we need to see what events a historian chooses to focus on
and how he interprets them. We need to understand the larger argument
the historian is developing, the broader framework through which he makes
sense of particular events.
Till recently the history of the world that we read was often a story of the
rise of the modern West. It was a story of continuous progress and
development: the expansion of technology and science, markets and trade,
reason and rationality, freedom and liberty. Individual histories of specific
events were very often structured within this larger story of the triumphal
march of the West. Imperial domination of the world was premised on this
conception of the past. The West saw itself as the bearer of progress: civilising
the world, introducing reforms, educating natives, expanding trades
and markets.
Should we not question this perception today?  To do that we need to
re-look at world history, travel across continents and long chronological
periods, and see whether we can think of this history in a new way. Themes
in World History will help you in this journey.
It will do so in three different ways.
First: it will introduce you to the darker histories that lie behind the
glorious stories of development and progress. You will see how the arrival of
explorers and traders in South America in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries did not simply open up the place for western commerce and culture;
it led to the spread of disease, destruction of civilisations and the decimation
of populations (Theme 8).  Later, when white settlers moved into North America
and Australia, what we had was not just progress (Theme 10). Behind the
history of the development of modern capitalist societies in these places lie
the disturbing stories of displacements of indigenous populations, and
even genocide.
2015-16(20/01/2015)
Second: when you read about the making of states and empires in Section
II, you will see that the drama unfolds not only in Rome (Theme 3), that is in
Europe, but in the Central Islamic states (Theme 4), and the land of the
Mongols (Theme 5). These chapters will tell you about the very different
ways in which society and polity are organised in these places.
Third: in reading Section IV you will see that there are different paths to
modernisation. There was a time when it was believed that industrialisation
first occurred in Britain and other countries tried to replicate this model in
various ways. So the developments of all countries were judged in relation
to the British model. Such an argument once again sees the West as the
centre of the world. But we know today that it is certainly not true that all
creativity flowed in only from the West. In opposition to this, however, we
cannot simply assert that the West had no influence on what was happening
elsewhere, or that historical developments in each country have to be seen
in isolation, that we should only look at the indigenous roots of all
developments. That would be a narrow and limited perspective, a form of
parochialism. Instead we need to recognise that in different countries people
act creatively to shape the world in which they live, and these developments
in turn have impact on other countries and continents, including Europe.
Theme 7 will help you see how even the cultural developments in Renaissance
Europe were so significantly influenced by developments in other parts of
the world.
Your journey will begin with the evolution of early human societies
(Theme1) and the early cities (Theme 2). You will then see how large states
and empires developed in three different parts of the world, and how these
societies were organised (Section II). In the next section, you will have a
close look at how European society and culture changed between the ninth
and the fifteenth centuries, and what European expansion meant for the
people of South America (Section III). Finally, you will read about the complex
history of the making of the modern world (Section IV). Many of the themes
will introduce you to the debates in the field and show how historians
continuously rethink old issues.
Each section begins with an Introduction and a Timeline. These timelines
are not for you to memorise for exams. They are meant to give you some idea
of what was happening in different places at any one point of time. They will
help you situate the history of one place in relation to another.
Constructing a timeline is always difficult. How do we choose the dates
to focus on? Not all historians would agree on the choices made. In fact, if
you compare different timelines, given in different books, for the same period,
you may find that the issues highlighted in them are different. So we need to
read each timeline critically, see what it tells us and what it does not.
Timelines frame history in particular ways.
This year you are not reading about the history of South Asia. The book
you read next year will be on ‘Themes in Indian History’. Over these two
years (Classes XI and XII) you will learn not only about some of the critical
events and processes in the history of the world, you will also discover how
historians come to know about the past. You will see what sources they use
and how they make sense of these; you will see how historical knowledge
develops through re-interpretations and debates.

2 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
N this section, we will read about two themes relating to
early societies. The first is about the beginnings of human
existence, from the remote past, millions of years ago. You will
learn how humans first emerged in Africa and how archaeologists
have studied these early phases of history from remains of bones and
stone tools.
Archaeologists have made attempts to reconstruct the lives of early
people – to find out about the shelters in which they lived, the food
they ate by gathering plant produce and hunting animals, and the
ways in which they expressed themselves. Other important
developments include the use of fire and of language. And, finally, you
will see whether the lives of people who live by hunting and gathering
today can help us to understand the past.
The second theme deals with some of the earliest cities – those of
Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq. These cities developed around temples,
and were centres of long-distance trade. Archaeological evidence –
remains of old settlements – and an abundance of written material are
used to reconstruct the lives of the different people who lived there –
craftspeople, scribes, labourers, priests, kings and queens. You will
notice how pastoral people played an important role in some of these
towns. A question to think about is whether the many activities that
went on in cities would have been possible if writing had not developed.
You may wonder as to how people who for millions of years had
lived in forests, in caves or temporary shelters began to eventually live
in villages and cities. Well, the story is a long one and is related to
several developments that took place at least 5,000 years before the
establishment of the first cities.
One of the most far-reaching changes was the gradual shift from
nomadic life to settled agriculture, which began around 10,000 years
ago. As you will see in Theme 1, prior to the adoption of agriculture,
people had gathered plant produce as a source of food. Slowly, they
learnt more about different kinds of plants – where they grew, the
seasons when they bore fruit and so on. From this, they learnt to
early societies

grow plants. In West Asia, wheat and barley, peas and various kinds of
pulses were grown. In East and Southeast Asia, the crops that grew
easily were millet and rice. Millet was also grown in Africa. Around the
same time, people learnt how to domesticate animals such as sheep,
goat, cattle, pig and donkey. Plant fibres such as cotton and flax, and
animal fibres such as wool were now woven into cloth. Somewhat
later, about 5,000 years ago, domesticated animals such as cattle and
donkeys were harnessed to ploughs and carts.
These developments led to other changes as well. When people grew
crops, they had to stay in the same place till the crops ripened. So,
settled life became more common. And with that, people built more
permanent structures in which to live.
This was also the time when some communities learnt how to make
earthen pots. These were used to store grain and other produce, and
to prepare and cook a variety of foods made from the new grains that
were cultivated. In fact, a great deal of attention was given to processing
foods to make them tasty and digestible.
The way stone tools were made also changed. While earlier methods
of making tools continued, some tools and equipment were now
smoothened and polished by an elaborate process of grinding. New
equipment included mortars and pestles for preparing grain, as well as
stone axes and hoes, which were used to clear land for cultivation, as
well as for digging the earth to sow seeds.
In some areas, people learnt to tap the ores of metals such as copper
and tin. Sometimes, copper ores were collected and used for their
distinctive bluish-green colour. This prepared the way for the more
extensive use of metal for jewellery and for tools subsequently.
There was also a growing familiarity with other kinds of produce
from distant lands (and seas). This included wood, stones, including
precious and semi-precious stones, metals and shell, and hardened
volcanic lava. Clearly, people were going from place to place, carrying
goods and ideas with them.
With increasing trade, the growth of villages and towns, and the
movements of people, in place of the small communities of early people
there now grew small states. While these changes took place slowly,
over several thousand years, the pace quickened with the growth of
the first cities. Also, the changes had far-reaching consequences.
Some scholars have described this as a revolution, as the lives of
people were probably transformed beyond recognition. Look out for
continuities and changes as you explore these two contrasting themes
in early history.
Remember too, that we have selected only some examples of early
societies for detailed study. There were other kinds of early societies,
including farming communities and pastoral peoples. And there were
other peoples who were hunter-gatherers as well as city dwellers, apart
from the examples selected.

4 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
This timeline focuses on the
emergence of humans and the
domestication of plants and animals.
It highlights some major technological
developments such as the use of fire,
metals, plough agriculture and the
wheel. Other processes that are shown
include the emergence of cities and the
use of writing. You will also find
mention of some of the earliest
empires – a theme that will be
developed in timeline II.
How to Read Timelines
You will find a timeline like this
one in every section.
Each of these will indicate some of
the major processes and events in
world history.
As you study the time lines,
remember—
Processes through which
ordinary women and men have
shaped history are far more
difficult to date than events
such as a war between kings.
Some dates may indicate the
beginning of a process, or when
it reaches maturation.
Historians are constantly
revising dates in the light of
new evidence, or new ways of
assessing old data.
While
divided
the timelines on a geographical
basis
matter
convenience,
historical
developments often transcend
these divisions.
Also, there is a chronological
overlap in historical processes.
Only some landmarks in human
history have been shown
here – we have highlighted the
processes dealt with in the
themes that follow, which also
have separate timelines.
Wherever you see a *, you will
also find an illustration related
to the date along the column.
Remember that blank spaces
do not mean that nothing was
happening – sometimes these
indicate that we do not as yet
know what was happening.
You will be learning more
about South Asian history in
general and Indian history in
particular next year. The dates
selected for South Asia
are only indicative of some
of the developments in the
subcontinent.

8 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
FROM THE BEGINNING
OF TIME
THIS chapter traces the beginning of human existence. It was
5.6 million years ago (written as mya) that the first human-
like creatures appeared on the earth's surface. After this,
several forms of humans emerged and then became extinct.
Human beings resembling us (henceforth referred to as
'modern humans') originated about 160,000 years ago. During
this long period of human history, people obtained food by
either scavenging or hunting animals and gathering plant
produce. They also learnt how to make stone tools and to
communicate with each other.
Although other ways of obtaining food were adopted later,
hunting-gathering continued. Even today there are hunter-
gatherer societies in some parts of the world. This makes us
wonder whether the lifestyles of present-day hunter-gatherers
can tell us anything about the past.
Discoveries of human fossils, stone tools and cave paintings
help us to understand early human history. Each of these
discoveries has a history of its own. Very often, when such
finds were first made, most scholars refused to accept that
these fossils were the remains of early humans. They were
also sceptical about the ability of early humans to make stone
tools or paint. It was only over a period of time that the true
significance of these finds was realised.
The evidence for human evolution comes from fossils of
species of humans which have become extinct. Fossils can
be dated either through direct chemical analysis or indirectly
by dating the sediments in which they are buried. Once fossils
are dated, a sequence of human evolution can be worked
When such discoveries were first made, about 200 years
ago, many scholars were often reluctant to accept that fossils
and other finds including stone tools and paintings were
actually connected with early forms of humans. This
reluctance generally stemmed from their belief in the Old
Testament of the Bible, according to which human origin was
regarded as an act of Creation by God.
For instance, in August 1856, workmen who were quarrying
for limestone in the Neander valley (see Map 2, p. 18), a gorge
near the German city of Dusseldorf, found a skull and some
skeletal fragments. These were handed over to Carl Fuhlrott,
a local schoolmaster and natural historian, who realised that
Fossils are the
remains or
impressions of a
very old plant,
animal or human
which have turned
into stone. These
are often embedded
in rock, and are
thus preserved for
millions of years.
Species is a group
of organisms that

produce fertile
offspring. Members
of one species

they did not belong to a modern human. He then made a
plaster cast of the skull and sent it to Herman Schaaffhausen,
a professor of anatomy at Bonn University. The following year
they jointly published a paper, claiming that this skull
represented a form of human that was extinct. At that time,
scholars did not accept this view and instead declared that
the skull belonged to a person of more recent times.
24 November 1859, when Charles Darwin’s On the Origin
of Species was published, marked a landmark in the study
of evolution. All 1,250 copies of the first print were sold out
the same day. Darwin argued that humans had evolved from
animals a long time ago.

10 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The Story of Human Evolution
(a) The Precursors of Modern Human Beings
Look at these four skulls.
A belongs to an ape.
B belongs to a species known as Australopithecus (see below).
C belongs to a species known as Homo erectus (literally ‘upright man’).
D belongs to a species known as Homo sapiens (literally ‘thinking/wise
man’} to which all present-day human beings belong.
List as many similarities and differences that you notice, looking
carefully at the brain case, jaws and teeth.
The differences that you notice in the skulls shown in the illustration
are some of the changes that came about as a result of human
evolution. The story of human evolution is enormously long, and
somewhat complicated. There are also many unanswered questions,
and new data often lead to a revision and modification of earlier
understandings. Let us look at some of the developments and their
implications more closely.
It is possible to trace these developments back to between 36 and
24 mya. We sometimes find it difficult to conceptualise such long
spans of time. If you consider a page of your book to represent
10,000 years, in itself a vast span of time, 10 pages would represent
100,000 years, and a 100 pages would equal 1 million years.
To think of 36 million years, you would have to imagine a book
3,600 pages long! That was when primates, a category of mammals,
emerged in Asia and Africa. Subsequently, by about 24 mya, there
emerged a subgroup amongst primates, called hominoids. This
included apes. And, much later, about 5.6 mya, we find evidence of
the first hominids.
While hominids have evolved from hominoids and share certain
common features, there are major differences as well. Hominoids have
a smaller brain than hominids. They are quadrupeds, walking on all
fours, but with flexible forelimbs. Hominids, by contrast, have an
upright posture and bipedal locomotion (walking on two feet). There
are also marked differences in the hand, which enables the making
and use of tools. We will examine the kinds of tools made and their
significance more closely later.
Two lines of evidence suggest an African origin for hominids. First,
it is the group of African apes that are most closely related to hominids.
Second, the earliest hominid fossils, which belong to the genus
Australopithecus, have been found in East Africa and date back to
about 5.6 mya. In contrast, fossils found outside Africa are no older
than 1.8 million years.
Primates
are a subgroup of a
larger group of
mammals. They
include monkeys,
apes and humans.
They have body
hair, a relatively
long gestation
period following
birth, mammary
glands, different
types of teeth, and
the ability to
maintain a constant
body temperature.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE HAND
A shows the precision grip of the chimpanzee.
B shows the power grip of the human hand.
C shows the precision grip of the hominid.
The development of the power grip probably
preceded the precision grip.
Compare the precision grip of the chimpanzee with that of the
human hand.
Make a list of the things you do using a precision grip.
What are the things you do using a power grip?
Hominids belong to a family known as Hominidae, which includes
all forms of human beings. The distinctive characteristics of hominids
include a large brain size, upright posture, bipedal locomotion and
specialisation of the hand.
Hominids are further subdivided into branches, known as genus, of
which Australopithecus and Homo are important. Each of these in
turn includes several species. The major differences between
Australopithecus and Homo relate to brain size, jaws and teeth.
The former has a smaller brain size, heavier jaws and larger teeth than
the latter.
Virtually all the names given by scientists to species are derived
from Latin and Greek words. For instance, the name Australopithecus
comes from a Latin word, ‘austral’, meaning ‘southern’ and a Greek
word, ‘pithekos’, meaning ‘ape.’ The name was given because this earliest
form of humans still retained many features of an ape, such as a
relatively small brain size in comparison to Homo, large back teeth and
limited dexterity of the hands. Upright walking was also restricted, as
they still spent a lot of time on trees. They retained characteristics

(such as long forelimbs, curved hand and foot bones and mobile ankle
joints) suited to life on trees. Over time, as tool making and long-
distance walking increased, many human characteristics also developed.
The Discovery of Australopithecus, Olduvai Gorge,
17 July 1959
The Olduvai Gorge (see p. 14) was first ‘discovered’ in the early twentieth century
by a German butterfly collector. However, Olduvai has come to be identified
with Mary and Louis Leakey, who worked here for over 40 years. It was Mary
Leakey who directed archaeological excavations at Olduvai and Laetoli and
she made some of the most exciting discoveries. This is what Louis Leakey
wrote about one of their most remarkable finds:
‘That morning I woke with a headache and
a slight fever. Reluctantly, I agreed to spend the
day in camp.With one of us out of commission,
it was even more vital for the other to continue
the work, for our precarious seven-week season
was running out. So Mary departed for the
diggings with Sally and Toots [two of their dogs]
in the Land-Rover [a jeep-like vehicle], and I
settled back to a restless day off.
Some time later – perhaps I dozed off – I heard
the Land-Rover coming up fast to camp. I had a
momentary vision of Mary stung by one of our
hundreds of resident scorpions or bitten by a
snake that had slipped past the dogs.
The Land-Rover rattled to a stop, and I heard
Mary’s voice calling over and over: “I’ve got him!
I've got him! I’ve got him!” Still groggy from the
headache, I couldn’t make her out. “Got what? Are you hurt?” I asked. “Him,
the man! Our man,” Mary said. “The one we’ve been looking for 23 years.
Come quick, I’ve found his teeth!” ’
– From ‘Finding the World's Earliest Man’, by L.S.B. Leakey, National Geographic, 118
(September 1960).
The remains of early humans have been classified into different
species. These are often distinguished from one another on the basis
of differences in bone structure. For instance, species of early humans
are differentiated in terms of their skull size and distinctive jaws (see
illustration on p.10). These characteristics may have evolved due to
what has been called the positive feedback mechanism.

THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK MECHANISM
The arrows pointing towards a box indicate the influences that

The arrows pointing away from a box indicate how developments
mentioned in the box influenced other processes.
For example, bipedalism enabled hands to be freed for carrying
infants or objects. In turn, as hands were used more and more, upright
walking gradually became more efficient. Apart from the advantage of
freeing hands for various uses, far less energy is consumed while walking
as compared to the movement of a quadruped. However, the advantage
in terms of saving energy is reversed while running. There is indirect
evidence of bipedalism as early as 3.6 mya. This comes from the
fossilised hominid footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania (see Section cover).
Fossil limb bones recovered from Hadar, Ethiopia provide more direct
evidence of bipedalism.
Around 2.5 mya, with the onset of a phase of glaciation (or an Ice
Age), when large parts of the earth were covered with snow, there were
major changes in climate and vegetation. Due to the reduction in
temperatures as well as rainfall, grassland areas expanded at the expense
of forests, leading to the gradual extinction of the early forms of
Australopithecus (that were adapted to forests) and the replacement
by species that were better adapted to the drier conditions. Among
these were the earliest representatives of the genus Homo.

Homo is a Latin word, meaning ‘man’, although there were women
as well! Scientists distinguish amongst several types of Homo. The
names assigned to these species are derived from what are regarded as
their typical characteristics. So fossils are classified as Homo habilis
(the tool maker), Homo erectus (the upright man), and Homo sapiens
(the wise or thinking man).
Fossils of Homo habilis have been discovered at Omo in Ethiopia
and at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. The earliest fossils of Homo erectus
have been found both in Africa and Asia: Koobi Fora, and west Turkana,
Kenya, Modjokerto and Sangiran, Java. As the finds in Asia belong to
a later date than those in Africa, it is likely that hominids migrated
from East Africa to southern and northern Africa, to southern and
north-eastern Asia, and perhaps to Europe, some time between 2 and
1.5 mya. This species survived for nearly a million years.

In some instances, the names for fossils are derived from the places
where the first fossils of a particular type were found. So fossils found
in Heidelberg, a city in Germany, were called Homo heidelbergensis,
while those found in the Neander valley (see p. 18) were categorised as
Homo neanderthalensis.
The earliest fossils from Europe are of Homo heidelbergensis and
Homo neanderthalensis. Both belong to the species of archaic (that is,
old) Homo sapiens. The fossils of Homo heidelbergensis (0.8-0.1 mya)
have a wide distribution, having been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.
The Neanderthals occupied Europe and western and Central Asia from
roughly 130,000 to 35,000 years ago. They disappeared abruptly in
western Europe around 35,000 years ago.
In general, compared with Australopithecus, Homo have a larger
brain, jaws with a reduced outward protrusion and smaller teeth (see
illustration on p. 10). An increase in brain size is associated with more
intelligence and a better memory. The changes in the jaws and teeth
were probably related to differences in dietary habits.

The Story of Human Evolution
(b) Modern Human Beings
If you look at this chart, you will notice that
some of the earliest evidence for Homo sapiens
has been found in different parts of Africa.
This raises the question of the centre of human
origin. Was there a single centre or were there
several?
The issue of the place of origin of modern
humans has been much debated. Two totally
divergent views have been expounded, one
advocating the regional continuity model (with
multiple regions of origin), the other the
replacement model (with a single origin in
Africa).
According to the regional continuity model,
the archaic Homo sapiens in different regions
gradually evolved at different rates into modern
humans, and hence the variation in the first
appearance of modern humans in different
parts of the world. The argument is based on
the regional differences in the features of
present-day humans. According to those who
advocate this view, these dissimilarities are due
to differences between the pre-existing Homo
erectus and Homo heidelbergensis populations
that occupied the same regions.
The Replacement and Regional
Continuity Models
The replacement model visualises the complete
replacement everywhere of all older forms of humans with modern
humans. In support of this view is the evidence of the genetic and
anatomical homogeneity of modern humans. Those who suggest
this argue that the enormous similarity amongst modern humans
is due to their descent from a population that originated in a single
region, which is Africa. The evidence of the earliest fossils of modern
humans (from Omo in Ethiopia) also supports the replacement model.
Scholars who hold this view suggest that the physical differences
observed today among modern humans are the result of adaptation
(over a span of thousands of years) by populations who migrated to
the particular regions where they finally settled down.

THE EARLIEST FOSSILS OF MODERN
HUMANS

Early Humans: Ways of Obtaining Food
So far, we have been considering the evidence of skeletal remains and
seeing how these have been used to reconstruct the histories of the
movements of peoples across continents. But, there are other, more routine
aspects of human life as well. Let us see how these can be studied.
Early humans would have obtained food through a number of ways,
such as gathering, hunting, scavenging and fishing. Gathering would
involve collecting plant foods such as seeds, nuts, berries, fruits and
tubers. That gathering was practised is generally assumed rather than
conclusively established, as there is very little direct evidence for it.
While we get a fair amount of fossil bones, fossilised plant remains are
relatively rare. The only other way of getting information about plant
intake would be if plant remains were accidentally burnt. This process
results in carbonisation. In this form, organic matter is preserved for
a long span of time. However, so far archaeologists have not found
much evidence of carbonised seeds for this very early period.
In recent years, the term hunting has been under discussion by
scholars. Increasingly, it is being suggested that the early hominids
scavenged or foraged* for meat and marrow from the  carcasses of
animals that had died naturally or had been killed by other predators.
It is equally possible that small mammals such as rodents, birds (and
their eggs), reptiles and even insects (such as termites) were eaten by
early hominids.
Hunting probably began later – about 500,000 years ago. The earliest
clear evidence for the deliberate, planned hunting and butchery of
large mammals comes from two sites: Boxgrove in southern England
(500,000 years ago) and Schoningen in Germany (400,000 years ago)

(see Map 2 ). Fishing was also important, as is evident from the discovery
of fish bones at different sites.
From about 35,000 years ago, there is evidence of planned hunting
from some European sites. Some sites, such as Dolni Vestonice (in
the Czech Republic, see Map 2), which was near a river, seem to have
been deliberately chosen by early people. Herds of migratory animals
such as reindeer and horse probably crossed the river during their
autumn and spring migrations and were killed on a large scale. The
choice of such sites indicates that people knew about the movement
of these animals and also about the means of killing large numbers
of animals quickly.
Did men and women have different roles in gathering, scavenging,
hunting and fishing? We do not really know. Today we find societies
that live by hunting and gathering, where women and men undertake
a range of different activities, but, as we will see later in the chapter, it
is not always possible to suggest parallels with the past.
Early Humans
From Trees, to Caves and Open-air Sites
We are on surer ground when we try to reconstruct the evidence for
patterns of residence. One way of doing this is by plotting the
distribution of artefacts. For example, thousands of flake tools and
hand axes have been excavated at Kilombe and Olorgesailie (Kenya).
These finds are dated between 700,000 and 500,000 years ago.

How did these tools accumulate in one place? It is possible that
some places, where food resources were abundant, were visited
repeatedly. In such areas, people would tend to leave behind traces of
their activities and presence, including artefacts. The deposited artefacts
would appear as patches on the landscape. The places that were less
frequently visited would have fewer artefacts, which may have been
scattered over the surface.
It is also important to remember that the same locations could have
been shared by hominids, other primates and carnivores. Look at the
diagram below to see how this may have worked.

Olorgesailie. The
excavators, Mary and
Louis Leakey, had a

Artefacts are
objects that are
made by human
beings. The term
can refer to a wide
range of things –
tools, paintings,
sculpture,
engravings.
Archaeologists suggest that early hominids such as Homo habilis probably
consumed most of the food where they found it, slept in different places, and
spent much of their time in trees. How would bones have reached the site? How
would stones have reached the site? Would bones have survived intact?

20 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Between 400,000 and 125,000 years ago, caves and open-air
sites began to be used. Evidence for this comes from sites in
Europe. In the Lazaret cave in southern France, a 12x4
metre shelter was built against the cave wall. Inside it
were two hearths and evidence of different food sources:
fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, bird eggs and freshwater
fish (trout, perch and carp). At another site, Terra Amata
on the coast of southern France, flimsy shelters with
roofs of wood and grasses were built for short-term,
seasonal visits.
Pieces of baked clay and burnt bone along with stone
tools, dated between 1.4 and 1 mya, have been found at Chesowanja,
Kenya and Swartkrans, South Africa. Were these the result of a natural
bushfire or volcanic eruption? Or were they produced through the
deliberate, controlled use of fire? We do not really know.
Hearths, on the other hand, are indications of the controlled use of
fire. This had several advantages – fire provided warmth and light
inside caves, and could be used for cooking. Besides, fire was used to
harden wood, as for instance the tip of the spear. The use of heat also
facilitated the flaking of tools. As important, fire could be used to scare
away dangerous animals.
Early Humans: Making Tools
To start with, it is useful to remember that the use of tools and tool
making are not confined to humans. Birds are known to make objects
to assist them with feeding, hygiene and social encounters;
and while foraging for food some chimpanzees use tools that they
have made.
However, there are some features of human tool making that are
not known among apes. As we have seen (see p. 11),
certain anatomical and neurological (related to
the nervous system) adaptations have led to
the skilled use of hands, probably due to
the important role of tools in human lives.
Moreover, the ways in which humans use
and make tools often require greater
memory and complex organisational skills,
both of which are absent in apes.
The earliest evidence for the
making and use of stone tools
comes from sites in Ethiopia and
Kenya (see Map 1). It is likely that
the earliest stone tool makers were
the Australopithecus.

As in the case of other activities, we do not know whether tool
making was done by men or women or both. It is possible that
stone tool makers were both women and men. Women in particular
may have made and used tools to obtain food for themselves as
well as to sustain their children after weaning.
About 35,000 years ago, improvements in the techniques for killing
animals are evident from the appearance
of new kinds of tools such as spear-
throwers and the bow and arrow. The
meat thus obtained was probably
processed by removing the bones, followed
by drying, smoking and storage. Thus, food
could be stored for later consumption.
There were other changes, such as the trapping of fur-bearing
animals (to use the fur for clothing) and the invention of sewing needles.
The earliest evidence of sewn clothing comes from about 21,000 years
ago. Besides, with the introduction of the punch blade technique to
make small chisel-like tools, it was now possible to make engravings
on bone, antler, ivory or wood.

Modes of Communication: Language and Art
Among living beings, it is humans alone that have a language. There
are several views on language development: (1) that hominid language
involved gestures or hand movements; (2) that spoken language was
preceded by vocal but non-verbal communication such as singing or
humming; (3) that human speech probably began with calls like the
ones that have been observed among primates. Humans may have
possessed a small number of speech sounds in the initial stage.
Gradually, these may have developed into language.
When did spoken language emerge? It has been suggested that the
brain of Homo habilis had certain features which would have made it
possible for them to speak. Thus, language may have developed as
early as 2 mya. The evolution of the vocal tract was equally important.
This occurred around 200,000 years ago. It is more specifically
associated with modern humans.
A third suggestion is that language developed around the same
time as art, that is, around 40,000-35,000 years ago. The development
of spoken language has been seen as closely connected with art, since
both are media for communication.
Cave Paintings at Altamira
Altamira is a cave site in Spain. The
paintings on the ceiling of the cave
were first brought to the attention
of Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola, a
local landowner and an amateur
archaeologist, by his daughter
Maria in November 1879. The little
girl was ‘running about in the
cavern and playing about here and
there’, while her father was digging
the floor of the cave. Suddenly she
noticed the paintings on the ceiling:
‘Look, Papa, oxen!’ At first, her
father just laughed, but soon
realised that some sort of paste
rather than paint had been used for the paintings and became ‘so
enthusiastic that he could hardly speak’. He published a booklet
the following year, but for almost two decades his findings were
dismissed by European archaeologists on the ground that these were
too good to be ancient.

Hundreds of paintings of animals (done between 30,000 and12,000
years ago) have been discovered in the caves of Lascaux and Chauvet,
both in France, and Altamira, in Spain. These include depictions of
bison, horses, ibex, deer, mammoths, rhinos, lions, bears, panthers,
hyenas and owls.
More questions have been raised than answered regarding these
paintings. For example, why do some areas of caves have paintings
and not others? Why were some animals painted and not others? Why
were men painted both individually and in groups, whereas women
were depicted only in groups? Why were men painted near animals
but never women? Why were groups of animals painted in the sections
of caves where sounds carried well?
Several explanations have been offered. One is that because of the
importance of hunting, the paintings of animals were associated with
ritual and magic. The act of painting could have been a ritual to ensure
a successful hunt. Another explanation offered is that these caves
were possibly meeting places for small groups of people or locations for
group activities. These groups could share hunting techniques and
knowledge, while paintings and engravings served as the media for
passing information from one generation to the next.
The above account of early societies has been based on
archaeological evidence. Clearly, there is much that we still do not
know. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, hunter-gatherer
societies exist even today. Can one learn anything about past societies
from present-day hunter-gatherers? This is a question we will
address in the next section.
Early Encounters with Hunter-Gatherers
in Africa
The following is an account by a member of an African pastoral group
about its initial contact in 1870 with the !Kung San, a hunter-gatherer
society living in the Kalahari desert:
When we first came into this area, all we saw were strange
footprints in the sand. We wondered what kind of people these
were. They were very afraid of us and would hide whenever we
came around. We found their villages, but they were always
empty because as soon as they saw strangers coming, they
would scatter and hide in the bush. We said: ‘Oh, this is good;
these people are afraid of us, they are weak and we can easily
rule over them.’ So we just ruled them. There was no killing
or fighting.

24 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The Hadza
‘The Hadza are a small group of hunters and gatherers, living in
the vicinity of Lake Eyasi, a salt, rift-valley lake...The country of the
eastern Hadza, dry, rocky savanna, dominated by thorn scrub and
acacia trees...is rich in wild foods. Animals are exceptionally
numerous and were certainly commoner at the beginning of the
century. Elephant, rhinoceros, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, waterbuck,
gazelle, warthog, baboon, lion, leopard, and hyena are all common,
as are smaller animals such as porcupine, hare, jackal, tortoise and
many others. All of these animals, apart from the elephant, are
hunted and eaten by the Hadza. The amount of meat that could be
regularly eaten without endangering the future of the game is
probably greater than anywhere else in the world where hunters
and gatherers live or have lived in the recent past.
Vegetable food – roots, berries, the fruit of the baobab tree, etc. –
though not often obvious to the casual observer, is always abundant
even at the height of the dry season in a year of drought. The type
of vegetable food available is different in the six-month wet season
from the dry season but there is no period of shortage. The honey
and grubs of seven species of wild bee are eaten; supplies of these
vary from season to season and from year to year.
Sources of water are widely distributed over the country in the wet
season but are very few in the dry season. The Hadza consider that
about 5-6 kilometres is the maximum distance over which water
can reasonably be carried and camps are normally sited within a
kilometre of a water course.
Part of the country consists of open grass plains but the Hadza
never build camps there. Camps are invariably sited among trees
or rocks and, by preference, among both.
The eastern Hadza assert no rights over land and its resources.
Any individual may live wherever he likes and may hunt animals,
collect roots, berries, and honey and draw water anywhere in Hadza
country without any sort of restriction...
In spite of the exceptional numbers of game animals in their
area, the Hadza rely mainly on wild vegetable matter for their
food. Probably as much as 80 per cent of their food by weight is
vegetable, while meat and honey together account for the
remaining 20 per cent.
Camps are commonly small and widely dispersed in the wet
season, large and concentrated near the few available sources of
water in the dry season.
There is never any shortage of food even in the time of drought.’
– Written in 1960 by James Woodburn, an anthropologist.

Hunter-Gatherer Societies
From the Present to the Past
As our knowledge of present-day hunter-gatherers increased through
studies by anthropologists, a question that began to be posed was
whether the information about living hunters and gatherers could be
used to understand past societies. Currently, there are two opposing
views on this issue.
On one side are scholars who have directly applied specific data
from present-day hunter-gatherer societies to interpret the
archaeological remains of the past. For example, some archaeologists
have suggested that the hominid sites, dated to 2 mya, along the
margins of Lake Turkana could have been dry season camps of early
humans, because such a practice has been observed among the Hadza
and the !Kung San.
On the other side are scholars who feel that ethnographic data
cannot be used for understanding past societies as the two are totally
different. For instance, present-day hunter-gatherer societies pursue
several other economic activities along with hunting and gathering.
These include engaging in exchange and trade in minor forest produce,
or working as paid labourers in the fields of neighbouring farmers.
Moreover, these societies are totally marginalised in all senses –
geographically, politically and socially. The conditions in which they
live are very different from those of early humans.
Another problem is that there is tremendous variation amongst
living hunter-gatherer societies. There are conflicting data on many
issues such as the relative importance of hunting and gathering, group
sizes, or the movement from place to place.
Also, there is little consensus regarding the division of labour in
food procurement. Although today generally women gather and men
hunt, there are societies where both women and men hunt and gather
and make tools. In any case, the important role of women in contributing
to the food supply in such societies cannot be denied. It is perhaps this
factor that ensures a relatively equal role for both women and men in
present-day hunter-gatherer societies, although there are variations.
While this may be the case today, it is difficult to make any such
inference for the past.
Epilogue
For several million years, humans lived by hunting wild animals and
gathering wild plants. Then, between 10,000 and 4,500 years ago,
people in different parts of the world learnt to domesticate certain
plants and animals. This led to the development of farming and
pastoralism as a way of life. The shift from foraging to farming was a

major turning point in human history. Why did this change take place
at this point of time?
The last ice age came to an end about 13,000 years ago and with
that warmer, wetter conditions prevailed. As a result, conditions were
favourable for the growth of grasses such as wild barley and wheat. At
the same time, as open forests and grasslands expanded, the population
of certain animal species such as wild sheep, goat, cattle, pig and
donkey increased. What we find is that human societies began to
gradually prefer areas that had an abundance of wild grasses and
animals. Now relatively large, permanent communities occupied such
areas for most parts of the year. With some areas being clearly preferred,
a pressure may have built up to increase the food supply. This may
have triggered the process of domestication of certain plants and
animals. It is likely that a combination of factors which included climatic
change, population pressure, a greater reliance on and knowledge of a
few species of plants (such as wheat, barley, rice and millet) and animals
(such as sheep, goat, cattle, donkey and pig) played a role in this
transformation.
One such area where farming and pastoralism began around 10,000
years ago was the Fertile Crescent, extending from the Mediterranean
coast to the Zagros mountains in Iran. With the introduction of
agriculture, more people began to stay in one place for even longer
periods than they had done before. Thus permanent houses began to
be built of mud, mud bricks and even stone. These are some of the
earliest villages known to archaeologists.
Farming and pastoralism led to the introduction of many other
changes such as the making of pots in which to store grain and other
produce, and to cook food. Besides, new kinds of stone tools came into
use. Other new tools such as the plough were used in agriculture.
Gradually, people became familiar with metals such as copper and tin.
The wheel, important for both pot making and transportation, came
into use.
About 5,000 years ago, even larger concentrations of people began
to live together in cities. Why did this happen? And what are the
differences between cities and other settlements? Look out for answers
to these and other questions in Theme 2.

writing and city life
CITY life began in Mesopotamia*, the land between the
Euphrates and the Tigris rivers that is now part of the
Republic of Iraq. Mesopotamian civilisation is known for its
prosperity, city life, its voluminous and rich literature and its
mathematics and astronomy. Mesopotamia’s writing system
and literature spread to the eastern Mediterranean, northern
Syria, and Turkey after 2000 BCE, so that the kingdoms of
that entire region were writing to one another, and to the
Pharaoh of Egypt, in the language and script of Mesopotamia.
Here we shall explore the connection between city life and
writing, and then look at some outcomes of a sustained
tradition of writing.
In the beginning of recorded history, the land, mainly the
urbanised south (see discussion below), was called Sumer
and Akkad. After 2000 BCE, when Babylon became an
important city, the term Babylonia was used for the southern
region. From about 1100 BCE, when the Assyrians established
their kingdom in the north, the region became known as
Assyria. The first known language of the land was Sumerian.
It was gradually replaced by Akkadian around 2400 BCE
when Akkadian speakers arrived. This language flourished
till about Alexander’s time (336-323 BCE), with some regional
changes occurring. From 1400 BCE, Aramaic also trickled in.
This language, similar to Hebrew, became widely spoken after
1000 BCE. It is still spoken in parts of Iraq.
Archaeology in Mesopotamia began in the 1840s. At one or
two sites (including Uruk and Mari, which we discuss below),
excavations continued for decades. (No Indian site has ever
seen such long-term projects.) Not only can we study
hundreds of Mesopotamian buildings, statues, ornaments,
graves, tools and seals as sources, there are thousands of
written documents.
Mesopotamia was important to Europeans because of
references to it in the Old Testament, the first part of the
Bible. For instance, the Book of Genesis of the Old Testament
refers to ‘Shimar’, meaning Sumer, as a land of brick-built
cities. Travellers and scholars of Europe looked on
Mesopotamia as a kind of ancestral land, and when
archaeological work began in the area, there was an attempt
to prove the literal truth of the Old Testament.

30 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
From the mid-nineteenth century there was no stopping
the enthusiasm for exploring the ancient past of
Mesopotamia. In 1873, a British newspaper funded an
expedition of the British Museum to search for a tablet
narrating the story of the Flood, mentioned in the Bible.
By the 1960s, it was understood that the stories of the
Old Testament were not literally true, but may have been
ways of expressing memories about important changes in
history. Gradually, archaeological techniques became far
more sophisticated and refined. What is more, attention was
directed to different questions, including reconstructing the
lives of ordinary people. Establishing the literal truth of
Biblical narratives receded into the background. Much of
what we discuss subsequently in the chapter is based on
these later studies.
According to the
Bible, the Flood was
meant to destroy
all life on earth.
However, God chose
a man, Noah, to
ensure that life
could continue after
the Flood. Noah
built a huge boat,
an ark. He took a
pair each of all
known species of
animals and birds
on board the ark,
which survived the
Flood. There was a
strikingly similar
story in the
Mesopotamian
tradition, where the
principal character
was called Ziusudra
or Utnapishtim.
Mesopotamia and its Geography
Iraq is a land of diverse environments. In the north-east lie green,
undulating plains, gradually rising to tree-covered mountain ranges
with clear streams and wild flowers, with enough rainfall to grow crops.
Here, agriculture began between 7000 and 6000 BCE. In the north,
there is a stretch of upland called a steppe, where animal herding
offers people a better livelihood than agriculture – after the winter
rains, sheep and goats feed on the grasses and low shrubs that grow
here. To the east, tributaries of the Tigris provide routes of

communication into the mountains of Iran. The south is a desert – and
this is where the first cities and writing emerged (see below). This
desert could support cities because the rivers Euphrates and Tigris,
which rise in the northern mountains, carry loads of silt (fine mud).
When they flood or when their water is let out on to the fields, fertile
silt is deposited.
WRITING AND CITY LIFE
After the Euphrates has entered the desert, its water flows out into
small channels. These channels flood their banks and, in the past,
functioned as irrigation canals: water could be let into the fields of
wheat, barley, peas or lentils when necessary. Of all ancient systems,
that of the Roman Empire (Theme 3) included, it was the agriculture
of southern Mesopotamia that was the most productive, even though
the region did not have sufficient rainfall to grow crops.
Not only agriculture, Mesopotamian sheep and goats that grazed
on the steppe, the north-eastern plains and the mountain slopes
(that is, on tracts too high for the rivers to flood and fertilise) produced
meat, milk and wool in abundance. Further, fish was available in
rivers and date-palms gave fruit in summer. Let us not, however,
make the mistake of thinking that cities grew simply because of
rural prosperity. We shall discuss other factors by and by, but first
let us be clear about city life.

32 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The Significance of Urbanism
Cities and towns are not just places with large populations. It is
when an economy develops in spheres other than food production
that it becomes an advantage for people to cluster in towns. Urban
economies comprise besides food production, trade, manufactures
and services. City people, thus, cease to be self-sufficient and depend
on the products or services of other (city or village) people. There is
continuous interaction among them. For instance, the carver of a
stone seal requires bronze tools that he himself cannot make, and
coloured stones for the seals that he does not know where to get:
his ‘specialisation’ is fine carving, not trading. The bronze tool maker
does not himself go out to get the metals, copper and tin. Besides,
he needs regular supplies of charcoal for fuel. The division of labour
is a mark of urban life.
Further, there must be a social organisation in place. Fuel, metal,
various stones, wood, etc., come from many different places for
city manufacturers. Thus, organised trade and storage is needed.
There are deliveries of grain and other food items from the village
to the city, and food supplies need to be stored and distributed.
Besides, many different activities have to be coordinated: there
must be not only stones but also bronze tools and pots available
for seal cutters. Obviously, in such a system some people give
commands that others obey, and urban economies often require
the keeping of written records.
The Warka Head
This woman’s head was sculpted in
white marble at Uruk before 3000
BCE. The eyes and eyebrows would
probably have taken lapis lazuli
(blue) and shell (white) and
bitumen (black) inlays, respectively.
There is a groove along the top of
the head, perhaps for an
ornament. This is a world-famous
piece of sculpture, admired for the
delicate modelling of the woman’s
mouth, chin and cheeks. And it was
modelled in a hard stone that
would have been imported from a
distance.
Beginning with the procurement of
stone, list all the specialists who would
be involved in the production of such a piece of sculpture.
The earliest cities in
Mesopotamia date
back to the bronze
age, c.3000 BCE.
Bronze is an alloy
of copper and tin.
Using bronze meant
procuring these
metals, often from
great distances.

Movement of Goods into Cities
However rich the food resources of Mesopotamia, its mineral resources
were few. Most parts of the south lacked stones for tools, seals and
jewels; the wood of the Iraqi date-palm and poplar was not good
enough for carts, cart wheels or boats; and there was no metal for
tools, vessels or ornaments. So we can surmise that the ancient
Mesopotamians could have traded their abundant textiles and
agricultural produce for wood, copper, tin, silver, gold, shell and
various stones from Turkey and Iran, or across the Gulf. These latter
regions had mineral resources, but much less scope for agriculture.
Regular exchanges – possible only when there was a social organisation
– to equip foreign expeditions and direct the exchanges were initiated
by the people of southern Mesopotamia.
Besides crafts, trade and services, efficient transport is also
important for urban development. If it takes too much time, or too
much animal feed, to carry grain or charcoal into cities on pack
animals or bullock carts, the city economy will not be viable. The
cheapest mode of transportation is, everywhere, over water. River
boats or barges loaded with sacks of grain are propelled by the current
of the river and/or wind, but when animals transport goods,
they need to be fed. The canals and natural channels of
ancient Mesopotamia were in fact routes of goods transport
between large and small settlements, and in the account on
the city of Mari later in the chapter, the importance of the
Euphrates as a ‘world route’ will become clear.
The Development of Writing
All societies have languages in which certain spoken sounds
convey certain meanings. This is verbal communication.
Writing too is verbal communication – but in a different
way. When we talk about writing or a script, we mean that
spoken sounds are represented in
visible signs.
The first Mesopotamian tablets,
written around 3200 BCE, contained
picture-like signs and numbers. These
were about 5,000 lists of oxen, fish, bread
loaves, etc. – lists of goods that were
brought into or distributed from the
temples of Uruk, a city in the south.
Clearly, writing began when society
needed to keep records of transactions –
because in city life transactions occurred
at different times, and involved many
people and a variety of goods.

34 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Mesopotamians wrote on tablets of clay. A scribe would wet clay
and pat it into a size he could hold comfortably in one hand. He would
carefully smoothen its surfaces. With the sharp end of a reed cut
obliquely, he would press wedge-shaped (‘cuneiform*’) signs on to the
smoothened surface while it was still moist. Once dried in the sun, the
clay would harden and tablets would be almost as indestructible as
pottery. When a written record of, say, the delivery of pieces of metal
had ceased to be relevant, the tablet was thrown away. Once the surface
dried, signs could not be pressed on to a tablet: so each transaction,
however minor, required a separate written tablet. This is why tablets
occur by the hundreds at Mesopotamian sites. And it is because of this
wealth of sources that we know so much more about Mesopotamia
than we do about contemporary India.
By 2600 BCE or so, the letters became cuneiform, and the language
was Sumerian. Writing was now used not only for keeping records,
but also for making dictionaries, giving legal validity to land transfers,
narrating the deeds of kings, and announcing the changes a king
had made in the customary laws of the land. Sumerian, the earliest
known language of Mesopotamia, was gradually replaced after
2400 BCE by the Akkadian language. Cuneiform writing in the
Akkadian language continued in use until the first century CE, that
is, for more than 2,000 years.
The System of Writing
The sound that a cuneiform sign represented was not a single consonant
or vowel (such as m or a in the English alphabet), but syllables (say,
-put-, or -la-, or –in-). Thus, the signs that a Mesopotamian scribe had

to learn ran into hundreds, and he had to be able to handle a wet
tablet and get it written before it dried. So, writing was a skilled craft
but, more important, it was an enormous intellectual achievement,
conveying in visual form the system of sounds of a particular language.
Literacy
Very few Mesopotamians could read and write. Not only were there
hundreds of signs to learn, many of these were complex (see p. 33). If
a king could read, he made sure that this was recorded in one of his
boastful inscriptions! For the most part, however, writing reflected the
mode of speaking.
A letter from an official would have to be read out to the king. So it
would begin:
‘To my lord A, speak: …  Thus says your servant B: … I have carried
out the work assigned to me ...’
A long mythical poem about creation ends thus:
‘Let these verses be held in remembrance and let the elder teach
them;
let the wise one and the scholar discuss them;
let the father repeat them to his sons;
let the ears of (even) the herdsman be opened to them.’
The Uses of Writing
The connection between city life, trade and writing is brought out in a
long Sumerian epic poem about Enmerkar, one of the earliest rulers of
Uruk. In Mesopotamian tradition, Uruk was the city par excellence,
often known simply as The City.
Enmerkar is associated with the organisation of the first trade of
Sumer: in the early days, the epic says, ‘trade was not known’.
Enmerkar wanted lapis lazuli and precious metals for the
beautification of a city temple and sent his messenger out to get
them from the chief of a very distant land called Aratta. ‘The
messenger heeded the word of the king. By night he went just by
the stars. By day, he would go by heaven’s sun divine. He had to go
up into the mountain ranges, and had to come down out of the
mountain ranges. The people of Susa (a city) below the mountains
saluted him like tiny mice*. Five mountain ranges, six mountain
ranges, seven mountain ranges he crossed...’
The messenger could not get the chief of Aratta to part with lapis
lazuli or silver, and he had to make the long journey back and forth,
again and again, carrying threats and promises from the king of Uruk.
Ultimately, the messenger ‘grew weary of mouth’. He got all the messages
mixed up. Then, ‘Enmerkar formed a clay tablet in his hand, and he
wrote the words down. In those days, there had been no writing down
of words on clay.’

Given the written tablet, ‘the ruler of Aratta examined the clay. The
spoken words were nails*. His face was frowning. He kept looking at
the tablet.’
This should not be taken as the literal truth, but it can be inferred
that in Mesopotamian understanding it was kingship that organised
trade and writing. This poem also tells us that, besides being a means
of storing information and of sending messages afar, writing was seen
as a sign of the superiority of Mesopotamian urban culture.
Urbanisation in Southern Mesopotamia:
Temples and Kings
From 5000 BCE, settlements had begun to develop in southern
Mesopotamia. The earliest cities emerged from some of these settlements.
These were of various kinds: those that gradually developed around
temples; those that developed as centres of trade; and imperial cities.
It is cities of the first two kinds that will be discussed here.
Early settlers (their origins are unknown) began to build and rebuild
temples at selected spots in their villages. The earliest known temple
was a small shrine made of unbaked bricks. Temples were the residences
of various gods: of the Moon God of Ur, or of Inanna the Goddess of Love
and War. Constructed in brick, temples became larger over time, with
several rooms around open courtyards. Some of the
early ones were possibly not unlike the ordinary house
– for the temple was the house of a god. But temples
always had their outer walls going in and out at regular
intervals, which no ordinary building ever had.
The god was the focus of worship: to him or her
people brought grain, curd and fish (the floors of some
early temples had thick layers of fish bones). The god
was also the theoretical owner of the agricultural fields,
the fisheries, and the herds of the local community. In
time, the processing of produce (for example, oil
pressing, grain grinding, spinning, and the weaving of
woollen cloth) was also done in the temple. Organiser
of production at a level above the household, employer
of merchants and keeper of written records of
distributions and allotments of grain, plough animals,
bread, beer, fish, etc., the temple gradually developed
its activities and became the main urban institution.
But there was also another factor on the scene.
In spite of natural fertility, agriculture was subject
to hazards. The natural outlet channels of the Euphrates would have
too much water one year and flood the crops, and sometimes they
would change course altogether. As the archaeological record shows,
villages were periodically relocated in Mesopotamian history. There
were man-made problems as well. Those who lived on the upstream

stretches of a channel could divert so much water into their fields
that villages downstream were left without water. Or they could neglect
to clean out the silt from their stretch of the channel, blocking the
flow of water further down. So the early Mesopotamian countryside
saw repeated conflict over land and water.
When there was continuous warfare in a region, those chiefs who
had been successful in war could oblige their followers by distributing
the loot, and could take prisoners from the defeated groups to employ
as their guards or servants. So they could increase their influence and
clout. Such war leaders, however, would be here today and gone
tomorrow – until a time came when such leadership came to increase
the well-being of the community with the creation of new institutions
or practices. In time, victorious chiefs began to offer precious booty to
the gods and thus beautify the community’s temples. They would send
men out to fetch fine stones and metal for the benefit of the god and
community and organise the distribution of temple wealth in an efficient
way by accounting for things that came in and went out. As the poem
about Enmerkar shows, this gave the king high status and the authority
to command the community.
We can imagine a mutually reinforcing cycle of development in
which leaders encouraged the settlement of villagers close to
themselves, to be able to rapidly get an army together. Besides,
people would be safe living in close proximity to one another. At
Uruk, one of the earliest temple towns, we find depictions of armed
heroes and their victims, and careful archaeological surveys have
shown that around 3000 BCE, when Uruk grew to the enormous
extent of 250 hectares – twice as large as Mohenjo-daro would be in
later centuries – dozens of small villages were deserted. There had

been a major population shift. Significantly, Uruk also came to
have a defensive wall at a very early date. The site was
continuously occupied from about 4200 BCE to about 400 CE,
and by about 2800 BCE it had expanded to 400 hectares.
War captives and local people were put to work for the
temple, or directly for the ruler. This, rather than
agricultural tax, was compulsory. Those who were put to
work were paid rations. Hundreds of ration lists have
been found, which give, against people’s names, the
quantities of grain, cloth or oil allotted to them. It has
been estimated that one of the temples took 1,500 men
working 10 hours a day, five years to build.
With rulers commanding people to fetch stones or metal
ores, to come and make bricks or lay the bricks for a
temple, or else to go to a distant country to fetch suitable
materials, there were also technical advances at Uruk around
3000 BCE. Bronze tools came into use for various crafts.
Architects learnt to construct brick columns, there being no
suitable wood to bear the weight of the roof of large halls.
Hundreds of people were put to work at making and baking clay
cones that could be pushed into temple walls, painted in different
colours, creating a colourful mosaic. In sculpture, there were superb
achievements, not in easily available clay but in imported stone.
And then there was a technological landmark that we can say is
appropriate to an urban economy: the potter’s wheel. In the long
run, the wheel enables a potter’s workshop to ‘mass produce’ dozens
of similar pots at a time.

The Seal – An Urban Artefact
In India, early stone seals were stamped. In Mesopotamia until the
end of the first millennium BCE, cylindrical stone seals, pierced down
the centre, were fitted with a stick and rolled over wet clay so that a
continuous picture was created. They were carved by very skilled
craftsmen, and sometimes carry writing: the name of the owner, his
god, his official position, etc. A seal could be rolled on clay covering
the string knot of a cloth package or the mouth of a pot, keeping
the contents safe. When rolled on a letter written on a clay tablet, it
became a mark of authenticity. So the seal was the mark of a city
dweller’s role in public life.
Life in the City
What we have seen is that a ruling elite had emerged: a small section
of society had a major share of the wealth. Nothing makes this fact as
clear as the enormous riches (jewellery, gold vessels, wooden musical
instruments inlaid with white shell and lapis lazuli, ceremonial daggers
of gold, etc.) buried with some kings and queens at Ur. But what of the
ordinary people?
We know from the legal texts (disputes, inheritance matters, etc.)
that in Mesopotamian society the nuclear family* was the norm,
although a married son and his family often resided with his parents.
The father was the head of the family. We know a little about the
procedures for marriage. A declaration was made about the
willingness to marry, the bride’s parents giving their consent to the
marriage. Then a gift was given by the groom’s people to the bride’s

people. When the wedding took place, gifts were exchanged by both
parties, who ate together and made offerings in a temple. When her
mother-in-law came to fetch her, the bride was given her share of
the inheritance by her father. The father’s  house, herds, fields, etc.,
were inherited by the sons.
Let us look at Ur, one of the earliest cities to have been excavated.
Ur was a town whose ordinary houses were systematically excavated
in the 1930s. Narrow winding streets indicate that wheeled carts
could not have reached many of the houses. Sacks of grain and
firewood would have arrived on donkey-back. Narrow winding
streets and the irregular shapes of house plots also indicate an
absence of town planning. There were no street drains of the kind
we find in contemporary Mohenjo-daro. Drains and clay pipes were
instead found in the inner courtyards of the Ur houses and it is
thought that house roofs sloped inwards and rainwater was
channelled via the drainpipes into sumps* in the inner courtyards.
This would have been a way of
preventing the unpaved streets
from becoming excessively slushy
after a downpour.
Yet people seem to have swept
all their household refuse into the
streets, to be trodden underfoot!
This made street levels rise, and
over time the thresholds of houses
had also to be raised so that no
mud would flow inside after the
rains. Light came into the rooms
not from windows but from
doorways opening into the
courtyards: this would also have
given families their privacy. There
were superstitions about houses,
recorded in omen tablets at Ur: a
raised threshold brought wealth;
a front door that did not open
towards another house was lucky;
but if the main wooden door of a
house opened outwards (instead of
inwards), the wife would be a
torment to her husband!
There was a town cemetery at

A Trading Town in a Pastoral Zone
After 2000 BCE the royal capital of Mari
flourished. You will have noticed (see Map 2)
that Mari stands not on the southern plain
with its highly productive agriculture but
much further upstream on the Euphrates.
Map 3 with its colour coding shows that
agriculture and animal rearing were carried
out close to each other in this region. Some
communities in the kingdom of Mari had
both farmers and pastoralists, but most of
its territory was used for pasturing sheep
and goats.
Herders need to exchange young animals,
cheese, leather and meat in return for grain,
metal tools, etc., and the manure of a penned
flock is also of great use to a farmer. Yet, at
the same time, there may be conflict. A
shepherd may take his flock to water across
a sown field, to the ruin of the crop.
Herdsmen being mobile can raid
agricultural villages and seize their stored
goods. For their part, settled groups may
deny pastoralists access to river and canal
water along a certain set of paths.
Through Mesopotamian history, nomadic
communities of the western desert filtered into the
prosperous agricultural heartland. Shepherds would
bring their flocks into the sown area in the summer.
Such groups would come in as herders, harvest labourers
or hired soldiers, occasionally become prosperous, and
settle down. A few gained the power to establish their
own rule. These included the Akkadians, Amorites,
Assyrians and Aramaeans. (You will read more about
rulers from pastoral societies in Theme 5.) The kings of
Mari were Amorites whose dress differed from that of
the original inhabitants and who respected not only the
gods of Mesopotamia but also raised a temple at Mari
for Dagan, god of the steppe. Mesopotamian society and
culture were thus open to different people and cultures,
and the vitality of the civilisation was perhaps due to
this intermixture.

44 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The kings of Mari, however, had to be vigilant; herders of various
tribes were allowed to move in the kingdom, but they were watched.
The camps of herders are mentioned frequently in letters between
kings and officials. In one letter, an officer writes to the king that
he has been seeing frequent fire signals at night – sent by one
camp to another – and he suspects that a raid or an attack is
being planned.
Located on the Euphrates in a prime position for trade – in wood,
copper, tin, oil, wine, and various other goods that were carried in
boats along the Euphrates – between the south and the mineral-
rich uplands of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon, Mari is a good example
of an urban centre prospering on trade. Boats carrying grinding
stones, wood, and wine and oil jars, would stop at Mari on their way
to the southern cities. Officers of this town would go aboard, inspect
the cargo (a single river boat could hold 300 wine jars), and levy a
charge of about one-tenth the value of the goods before allowing the
boat to continue downstream. Barley came in special grain boats.
Most important, tablets refer to copper from ‘Alashiya’, the island
of Cyprus, known for its copper, and tin was also an item of trade.
As bronze was the main industrial material for tools and weapons,
this trade was of great importance. Thus, although the kingdom of
Mari was not militarily strong, it was exceptionally prosperous.
Excavating Mesopotamian Towns
Today, Mesopotamian excavators have much higher standards of accuracy and care in
recording than in the old days, so that few dig huge areas the way Ur was excavated.
Moreover, few archaeologists have the funds to employ large teams of excavators.
Thus, the mode of obtaining data has changed.
Take the small town at Abu Salabikh, about 10 hectares in area in 2500 BCE with a
population less than 10,000. The outlines of walls were at first traced by scraping
surfaces. This involves scraping off the top few millimetres of the mound with the
sharp and wide end of a shovel or other tool. While the soil underneath was still slightly
moist, the archaeologist could make out different colours, textures and lines of brick
walls or pits or other features. A few houses that were discovered were excavated. The
archaeologists also sieved through tons of earth to recover plant and animal remains,
and in the process identified many species of plants and animals and found large
quantities of charred fish bones that had been swept out on to the streets. Plant seeds
and fibre remained after dung cakes had been burned as fuel and thus kitchens were
identified. Living rooms were those with fewer traces. Because they found the teeth of
very young pigs on the streets, archaeologists concluded that pigs must have roamed
freely here as in any other Mesopotamian town. In fact, one house burial contained
some pig bones – the dead person must have been given some pork for his nourishment
in the afterlife! The archaeologists also made microscopic studies of room floors to
decide which rooms in a house were roofed (with poplar logs, palm leaves, straw, etc.)
and which were open to the sky.

Cities in Mesopotamian Culture
Mesopotamians valued city life in which people of many communities
and cultures lived side by side. After cities were destroyed in war, they
recalled them in poetry.
The most poignant reminder to us of the pride Mesopotamians
took in their cities comes at the end of the Gilgamesh Epic, which
was written on twelve tablets. Gilgamesh is said to have ruled the
city of Uruk some time after Enmerkar. A great hero who subdued
people far and wide, he got a shock when his heroic friend died. He
then set out to find the secret of immortality, crossing the waters
that surround the world. After a heroic attempt, Gilgamesh failed,
and returned to Uruk. There, he consoled himself by walking along
the city wall, back and forth. He admired the foundations made of
fired bricks that he had put into place. It is on the city wall of Uruk
that the long tale of heroism and endeavour fizzles out. Gilgamesh
does not say that even though he will die his sons will outlive him,
as a tribal hero would have done. He takes consolation in the city
that his people had built.
The Legacy of Writing
While moving narratives can be transmitted orally, science requires
written texts that generations of scholars can read and build upon.
Perhaps the greatest legacy of Mesopotamia to the world is its scholarly
tradition of time reckoning and mathematics.
Dating around 1800 BCE are tablets with multiplication and division
tables, square- and square-root tables, and tables of compound interest.
The square root of 2 was given as:
1 + 24/60 + 51/602 + 10/603
If you work this out, you will find that the answer is 1.41421296, only
slightly different from the correct answer, 1.41421356. Students had
to solve problems such as the following: a field of area such and such
is covered one finger deep in water; find out the volume of water.
The division of the year into 12 months according to the revolution
of the moon around the earth, the division of the month into four
weeks, the day into 24 hours, and the hour into 60 minutes – all that
we take for granted in our daily lives – has come to us from the
Mesopotamians. These time divisions were adopted by the successors
of Alexander and from there transmitted to the Roman world, then to
the world of Islam, and then to medieval Europe (see Theme 7 for how
this happened).
Whenever solar and lunar eclipses were observed, their occurrence
was noted according to year, month and day. So too there were
records about the observed positions of stars and constellations in
the night sky.

None of these momentous Mesopotamian achievements would
have been possible without writing and the urban institution of
schools, where students read and copied earlier written tablets, and
where some boys were trained to become not record keepers for the
administration, but intellectuals who could build on the work of
their predecessors.
We would be mistaken if we think that the preoccupation with the
urban world of Mesopotamia is a modern phenomenon. Let us look,
finally, at two early attempts to locate and preserve the texts and
traditions of the past.
An Early Library
In the iron age, the Assyrians of the north created an empire, at its height
between 720 and 610 BCE, that stretched as far west as Egypt. The state economy
was now a predatory one, extracting labour and tribute in the form of food,
animals, metal and craft items from a vast subject population.
The great Assyrian kings, who had been immigrants, acknowledged the
southern region, Babylonia, as the centre of high culture and the last of
them, Assurbanipal (668-627 BCE), collected a library at his capital, Nineveh
in the north. He made great efforts to gather tablets on history, epics, omen
literature, astrology, hymns and poems. He sent his scribes south to find old
tablets. Because scribes in the south were trained to read and write in schools
where they all had to copy tablets by the dozen, there were towns in Babylonia
where huge collections of tablets were created and acquired fame. And
although Sumerian ceased to be spoken after about 1800 BCE, it continued to
be taught in schools, through vocabulary texts, sign lists, bilingual (Sumerian
and Akkadian) tablets, etc. So even in 650 BCE, cuneiform tablets written as
far back as 2000 BCE were intelligible – and Assurbanipal’s men knew where
to look for early tablets or their copies.
Copies were made of important texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the
copier stating his name and writing the date. Some tablets ended with a
reference to Assurbanipal:
‘I, Assurbanipal, king of the universe, king of Assyria, on whom the gods
bestowed vast intelligence, who could acquire the recondite details of
scholarly erudition, I wrote down on tablets the wisdom of the gods … And
I checked and collated the tablets. I placed them for the future in the library
of the temple of my god, Nabu, at Nineveh, for my life and the well-being
of my soul, and to sustain the foundations of my royal throne…’
More important, there was cataloguing: a basket of tablets would have a clay
label that read: ‘n number of tablets about exorcism, written by X’. Assurbanipal’s
library had a total of some 1,000 texts, amounting to about 30,000 tablets, grouped
according to subject.

And, an Early Archaeologist!
A man of the southern marshes, Nabopolassar, released Babylonia from
Assyrian domination in 625 BCE. His successors increased their territory and
organised building projects at Babylon. From that time, even after the
Achaemenids of Iran conquered Babylon in 539 BCE and until 331 BCE when
Alexander conquered Babylon, Babylon was the premier city of the world,
more than 850 hectares, with a triple wall, great palaces and temples, a
ziggurat or stepped tower, and a processional way to the ritual centre. Its
trading houses had widespread dealings and its mathematicians and
astronomers made some new discoveries.
Nabonidus was the last ruler of independent Babylon. He writes that the
god of Ur came to him in a dream and ordered him to appoint a priestess
to take charge of the cult in that ancient town in the deep south. He writes:
‘Because for a very long time the office of High Priestess had been forgotten,
her characteristic features nowhere indicated, I bethought myself day after
day …’
Then, he says, he found the stele of a very early king whom we today
date to about 1150 BCE and saw on that stele the carved image of the Priestess.
He observed the clothing and the jewellery that was depicted. This is how
he was able to dress his daughter for her consecration as Priestess.
On another occasion, Nabonidus’s men brought to him a broken statue
inscribed with the name of Sargon, king of Akkad. (We know today that
the latter ruled around 2370 BCE.) Nabonidus, and indeed many
intellectuals, had heard of this great king of remote times. Nabonidus felt
he had to repair the statue. ‘Because of my reverence for the gods and
respect for kingship,’ he writes, ‘I summoned skilled craftsmen, and replaced
the head.’

50 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
VER the two millennia that followed the establishment
of empires in Mesopotamia, various attempts at empire-
building took place across the region and in the area to the
west and east of it.
By the sixth century BCE, Iranians had established control over
major parts of the Assyrian empire.  Networks of trade developed
overland, as well as along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.
In the eastern Mediterranean, Greek cities and their colonies benefited
from improvements in trade that were the result of these changes.
They also benefited from close trade with nomadic people to the north
of the Black Sea. In Greece, for the most part, city-states such as
Athens and Sparta were the focus of civic life. From among the Greek
states, in the late fourth century BCE, the ruler of the kingdom of
Macedon, Alexander, undertook a series of military campaigns and
conquered parts of North Africa, West Asia and Iran, reaching up to
the Beas. Here, his soldiers refused to proceed further east. Alexander’s
troops retreated, though many Greeks stayed behind.
Throughout the area under Alexander’s control, ideals and cultural
traditions were shared amongst the Greeks and the local population.
The region on the whole became ‘Hellenised’ (the Greeks were called
Hellenes), and Greek became a well-known language throughout. The
political unity of Alexander’s empire disintegrated quickly after his
death, but for almost three centuries after, Hellenistic culture remained
important in the area. The period is often referred to as the ‘Hellenistic
period’ in the history of the region, but this ignores the way in which
other cultures (especially Iranian culture associated with the old empire
of Iran) were as important as – if not often more important than –
Hellenistic notions and ideas.
This section deals with important aspects of what happened after
this.
Small but well-organised military forces of the central Italian city-
state of Rome took advantage of the political discord that followed the
disintegration of Alexander’s empire and established control over North
Africa and the eastern Mediterranean from the second century BCE.

At the time, Rome was a republic. Government was based on a complex
system of election, but its political institutions gave some importance
to birth and wealth and society benefited from slavery. The forces of
Rome established a network for trade between the states that had
once been part of Alexander’s empire. In the middle of the first century
BCE, under Julius Caesar, a high-born military commander, this
‘Roman Empire’ was extended to present-day Britain and Germany.
Latin (spoken in Rome) was the main language of the empire,
though many in the east continued to use Greek, and the Romans
had a great respect for Hellenic culture.  There were changes in the
political structure of the empire from the late first century BCE, and it
was substantially Christianised after the emperor Constantine became
a Christian in the fourth century ce.
To make government easier, the Roman Empire was divided into
eastern and western halves in the fourth century CE. But in the west,
there was a breakdown of the arrangements that existed between Rome
and the tribes in frontier areas (Goths, Visigoths, Vandals and others).
These arrangements dealt with trade, military recruitment and

settlement, and the tribes increasingly attacked the Roman
administration. Conflicts increased in scale, and coincided with internal
dissensions in the empire, leading the collapse of the empire in the
west by the fifth century CE. Tribes established their own kingdoms
within the former empire, though, with the prompting of the Christian
Church, a Holy Roman Empire was formed from some of these
kingdoms from the ninth century CE. This claimed some continuity
with the Roman Empire.
Between the seventh century and the fifteenth century, almost all
the lands of the eastern Roman Empire (centred on Constantinople)
came to be taken over by the Arab empire – created by the followers of
the Prophet Muhammad (who founded the faith of Islam in the seventh
century) and centred on Damascus – or by its successors (who ruled
from Baghdad initially). There was a close interaction between Greek
and Islamic traditions in the region.  The trading networks of the area
and its prosperity attracted the attention of pastoral peoples to the
north including various Turkic tribes, who often attacked the cities of
the region and established control. The last of these peoples to attack
the area and attempt to control it were the Mongols, under Genghis
Khan and his successors, who moved into West Asia, Europe, Central
Asia and China in the thirteenth century.
All these attempts to make and maintain empires were driven by
the search to control the resources of the trading networks that existed
in the region as a whole, and to derive benefit from the links of the
region with other areas such as India or China. All the empires evolved
administrative systems to give stability to trade. They also evolved

different types of military organisation. The  achievements of one empire
were often taken up by its successor. Over time, the area came to be
marked by Persian, Greek, Latin and Arabic above many other languages
that were spoken and written.
The empires were not very stable. This was partly due to disputes
and conflict over resources in various regions. It was also due to the
crisis that developed in relations between empires and pastoral peoples
to the north – from whom empires derived support both for their trade
and to provide them with labour for production of manufactures and
for their armies. It is worth noting that not all empires were city-
centric. The Mongol empire of Genghis Khan and his successors is a
good example of how an empire could be maintained by pastoral people
for a long time and with success.
Religions that appealed to peoples of different ethnic origins, who
often spoke different languages, were important in the making of large

This timeline focuses on kingdoms and empires. Some of
these such as the Roman empire were very large,
spreading across three continents. This was also the
time when some of the major religious and cultural
traditions developed. It was a time when institutions of
intellectual activity emerged. Books were written and
ideas travelled across continents. Some things that are
now part of our everyday lives were used for the first
time during this period.

An Empire Across
Three Continents
THE Roman Empire covered a vast stretch of territory that
included most of Europe as we know it today and a large
part of the Fertile Crescent and North Africa. In this chapter
we shall look at the way this empire was organised, the
political forces that shaped its destiny, and the social groups
into which people were divided. You will see that the empire
embraced a wealth of local cultures and languages; that
women had a stronger legal position then than they do in
many countries today; but also that much of the economy
was run on slave labour, denying freedom to substantial
numbers of persons. From the fifth century on, the empire fell
apart in the west but remained intact and exceptionally
prosperous in its eastern half. The caliphate which you will
read about in the next chapter built on this prosperity and
inherited its urban and religious traditions.
Roman historians have a rich collection of sources to go on,
which we can broadly divide into three groups: (a) texts,
(b) documents and (c) material remains. Textual sources
include histories of the period written by contemporaries (these
were usually called ‘Annals’, because the narrative was
constructed on a year-by-year basis), letters, speeches,
sermons, laws, and so on. Documentary sources include
mainly inscriptions and papyri. Inscriptions were usually cut
on stone, so a large number survive, in both Greek and Latin.
The ‘papyrus’ was a reed-like plant that grew along the banks
of the Nile in Egypt and was processed to produce a writing
material that was very widely used in everyday life. Thousands
of contracts, accounts, letters and official documents survive
‘on papyrus’ and have been published by scholars who are
called ‘papyrologists’. Material remains include a very wide
assortment of items that mainly archaeologists discover (for
example, through excavation and field survey), for example,
buildings, monuments and other kinds of structures, pottery,
coins, mosaics, even entire landscapes (for example, through
the use of aerial photography). Each of these sources can only
tell us just so much about the past, and combining them can
be a fruitful exercise, but how well this is done depends on
the historian’s skill!

Two powerful empires ruled over most of Europe,North Africa and the
Middle East in the period between the birth of Christ and the early part
of the seventh century, say, down to the 630s. The two empires were
those of Rome and Iran. The Romans and Iranians were rivals and
fought against each other for much of their history. Their empires lay
next to each other, separated only by a narrow strip of land that ran
along the river Euphrates. In this chapter we shall be looking at the
Roman Empire, but we shall also refer, in passing, to Rome’s rival, Iran.
If you look at the map, you will see that the continents of Europe and
Africa are separated by a sea that stretches all the way from Spain in the
west to Syria in the east. This sea is called the Mediterranean, and it was
the heart of Rome’s empire. Rome dominated the Mediterranean and all
the regions around that sea in both directions, north as well as south.
To the north, the boundaries of the empire were formed by two great
rivers, the Rhine and the Danube; to the south, by the huge expanse of
desert called the Sahara. This vast stretch of territory was the Roman
Empire. Iran controlled the whole area south of the Caspian Sea down
to eastern Arabia, and sometimes large parts of Afghanistan as well.
These two superpowers had divided up most of the world that the Chinese
called Ta Ch’in (‘greater Ch’in’, roughly the west).

60 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The Early Empire
The Roman Empire can broadly be divided into two phases, ‘early’ and
‘late’, divided by the third century as a sort of historical watershed
between them. In other words, the whole period down to the main part
of the third century can be called the ‘early empire’, and the period
after that the ‘late empire’.
A major difference between the two superpowers and their respective
empires was that the Roman Empire was culturally much more diverse
than that of Iran. The Parthians and later the Sasanians, the dynasties
that ruled Iran in this period, ruled over a population that was largely
Iranian. The Roman Empire, by contrast, was a mosaic of territories
and cultures that were chiefly bound together by a common system of
government. Many languages were spoken in the empire, but for the
purposes of administration Latin and Greek were the most widely used,
indeed the only languages. The upper classes of the east spoke and
wrote in Greek, those of the west in Latin, and the boundary between
these broad language areas ran somewhere across the middle of the
Mediterranean, between the African provinces of Tripolitania (which
was Latin speaking) and Cyrenaica (Greek-speaking). All those who
lived in the empire were subjects of a single ruler, the emperor, regardless
of where they lived and what language they spoke.
The regime established by Augustus, the first emperor, in 27 BCE
was called the ‘Principate’. Although Augustus was the sole ruler and
the only real source of authority, the fiction was kept alive that he was
actually only the ‘leading citizen’ (Princeps in Latin), not the absolute
ruler. This was done out of respect for the Senate, the body which had
controlled Rome earlier, in the days when it was a Republic.* The
Senate had existed in Rome for centuries, and had been and remained
a body representing the aristocracy, that is, the wealthiest families of
Roman and, later, Italian descent, mainly landowners. Most of the
Roman histories that survive in Greek and Latin were written by people
from a senatorial background. From these it is clear that emperors
were judged by how they behaved towards the Senate. The worst
emperors were those who were hostile to the senatorial class, behaving
with suspicion or brutality and violence. Many senators yearned to go
back to the days of the Republic, but most must have realised that this
was impossible.
Next to the emperor and the Senate, the other key institution of
imperial rule was the army. Unlike the army of its rival in the Persian
empire, which was a conscripted** army, the Romans had a paid
professional army where soldiers had to put in a minimum of 25 years
of service. Indeed, the existence of a paid army was a distinctive feature
of the Roman Empire. The army was the largest single organised body
in the empire (600,000 by the fourth century) and it certainly had the
power to determine the fate of emperors. The soldiers would constantly
agitate for better wages and service conditions. These agitations often
*The Republic was
the name for a
regime in which the
reality of power lay
with the Senate, a
body dominated by a
small group of
wealthy families who
formed the ‘nobility’.
In practice, the
Republic represented
the government of
the nobility,
exercised through the
body called the
Senate. The Republic
lasted from 509 BC to
27 BC, when it was
overthrown by
Octavian, the
adopted son and heir
of Julius Caesar, who
later changed his
name to Augustus.

took the form of mutinies, if the soldiers
felt let down by their generals or even the
emperor. Again, our picture of the Roman
army depends largely on the way they were
portrayed by historians with senatorial
sympathies. The Senate hated and feared
the army, because it was a source of often-
unpredictable violence, especially in the
tense conditions of the third century when
government was forced to tax more heavily
to pay for its mounting military
expenditures.
To sum up, the emperor, the aristocracy
and the army were the three main ‘players’
in the political history of the empire. The
success of individual emperors depended
on their control of the army, and when the
armies were divided, the result usually was
civil war*. Except for one notorious year (69 CE), when four emperors
mounted the throne in quick succession, the first two centuries were
on the whole free from civil war and in this sense relatively stable.
Succession to the throne was based as far as possible on family descent,
either natural or adoptive, and even the army was strongly wedded to
this principle. For example, Tiberius (14-37 CE), the second in the long
line of Roman emperors, was not the natural son of Augustus, the
ruler who founded the Principate, but Augustus adopted him to ensure
a smooth transition.
External warfare was also much less common in the first two
centuries. The empire inherited by Tiberius from Augustus was already
so vast that further expansion was felt to be unnecessary. In fact, the
‘Augustan age’ is remembered for the peace it ushered in after decades
of internal strife and centuries of military conquest. The only major
campaign of expansion in the early empire was Trajan’s fruitless
occupation of territory across the Euphrates, in the years 113-17 CE
abandoned by his successors.
*Civil war refers to
armed struggles for
power within the
same country, in
contrast to conflicts

Much more characteristic was the gradual extension of Roman direct
rule. This was accomplished by absorbing a whole series of ‘dependent’
kingdoms into Roman provincial territory. The Near East was full of
such kingdoms*, but by the early second century those which lay west
of the Euphrates (towards Roman territory) had disappeared, swallowed
up by Rome. (Incidentally, some of these kingdoms were exceedingly
wealthy, for example Herod’s kingdom yielded the equivalent of 5.4
million denarii per year, equal to over 125,000 kg of gold! The denarius
was a Roman silver coin containing about 4½ gm of pure silver.)
In fact, except for Italy, which was not considered a province in
these centuries, all the territories of the empire were organised into
provinces and subject to taxation. At its peak in the second century,
the Roman Empire stretched from Scotland to the borders of
Armenia, and from the Sahara to the Euphrates and sometimes
beyond. Given that there was no government in the modern sense
to help them to run things, you may well ask, how was it possible
for the emperor to cope with the control and administration of such
a vast and diverse set of territories, with a population of some 60
million in the mid-second century? The answer lies in the
urbanisation of the empire.
The great urban centres that lined the shores of the Mediterranean
(Carthage, Alexandria, Antioch were the biggest among them) were
the true bedrock of the imperial system. It was through the cities
that ‘government’ was able to tax the provincial countrysides which
generated much of the wealth of the empire. What this means is
that the local upper classes actively collaborated with the Roman
state in administering their own territories and raising taxes from
them. In fact, one of the most interesting aspects of Roman political
history is the dramatic shift in power between Italy and the provinces.
Throughout the second and third centuries, it was the provincial
upper classes who supplied most of the cadre that governed the
provinces and commanded the armies. They came to form a new
elite of administrators and
military commanders who
became much more powerful
than the senatorial class because
they had the backing of the
emperors. As this new group
emerged, the emperor Gallienus
(253-68) consolidated their rise to
power by excluding senators from
military command. We are told
that Gallienus forbade senators
from serving in the army or
having access to it, in order to
prevent control of the empire from
falling into their hands.

To sum up, in the late first, second and early third centuries the
army and administration were increasingly drawn from the provinces,
as citizenship spread to these regions and was no longer confined to
Italy. But individuals of Italian origin continued to dominate the senate
at least till the third century, when senators of provincial origin became
a majority. These trends reflected the general decline of Italy within
the empire, both political and economic, and the rise of new elites in
the wealthier and more urbanised parts of the Mediterranean, such as
the south of Spain, Africa and the east. A city in the Roman sense was
an urban centre with its own magistrates, city council and a ‘territory’
containing villages which were under its jurisdiction. Thus one city
could not be in the territory of another city, but villages almost always
were. Villages could be upgraded to the status of cities, and vice versa,
usually as a mark of imperial favour (or the opposite). One crucial
advantage of living in a city was simply that it might be better provided
for during food shortages and even famines than the countryside.
The Doctor Galen on how Roman Cities
Treated the Countryside
The famine prevalent for many successive years in many provinces has clearly
displayed for men of any understanding the effect of malnutrition in generating
illness. The city-dwellers, as it was their custom to collect and store enough grain
for the whole of the next year immediately after the harvest, carried off all the
wheat, barley, beans and lentils, and left to the peasants various kinds of pulse –
after taking quite a large proportion of these to the city. After consuming what was
left in the course of the winter, the country people had to resort to unhealthy foods
in the spring; they ate twigs and shoots of trees and bushes and bulbs and roots of
inedible plants…
– Galen, On Good and Bad Diet.
Public baths were a striking feature of
Roman urban life (when one Iranian ruler
tried to introduce them into Iran, he
encountered the wrath of the clergy there!
Water was a sacred element and to use it
for public bathing may have seemed a
desecration to them), and urban
populations also enjoyed a much higher
level of entertainment. For example, one
calendar tells us that spectacula (shows)
filled no less than 176 days of the year!

64 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The Third-Century Crisis
If the first and second centuries were by and large a period of peace,
prosperity and economic expansion, the third century brought the
first major signs of internal strain. From the 230s, the empire found
itself fighting on several fronts simultaneously. In Iran a new and
more aggressive dynasty emerged in 225 (they called themselves the
‘Sasanians’) and within just 15 years were expanding rapidly in the
direction of the Euphrates. In a famous rock inscription cut in three
languages, Shapur I, the Iranian ruler, claimed he had annihilated a
Roman army of 60,000 and even captured the eastern capital of Antioch.
Meanwhile, a whole series of Germanic tribes or rather tribal
confederacies (most notably, the Alamanni, the Franks and the Goths)
began to move against the Rhine and Danube frontiers, and the whole
period from 233 to 280 saw repeated invasions of a whole line of
provinces that stretched from the Black Sea to the Alps and southern
Germany. The Romans were forced to abandon much of the territory
beyond the Danube, while the emperors of this period were constantly
in the field against what the Romans called ‘barbarians’. The rapid
succession of emperors in the third century (25 emperors in 47 years!)
is an obvious symptom of the strains faced by the empire in this period.
Gender, Literacy, Culture
One of the more modern features of Roman society was the widespread
prevalence of the nuclear family. Adult sons did not live with their
families, and it was exceptional for adult brothers to share a common
household. On the other hand, slaves were included in the family as
the Romans understood this. By the late Republic (the first century
BCE), the typical form of marriage was one where the wife did not
transfer to her husband’s authority but retained full rights in the
property of her natal family. While the woman’s dowry went to the
husband for the duration of the marriage, the woman remained a
primary heir of her father and became an independent property owner
on her father’s death. Thus Roman women enjoyed considerable legal
rights in owning and managing property. In other words, in law the
married couple was not one financial entity but two, and the wife
enjoyed complete legal independence. Divorce was relatively easy and
needed no more than a notice of intent to dissolve the marriage by
either husband or wife. On the other hand, whereas males married in
their late twenties or early thirties, women were married off in the late
teens or early twenties, so there was an age gap between husband and
wife and this would have encouraged a certain inequality. Marriages
were generally arranged, and there is no doubt that women were often
subject to domination by their husbands. Augustine*, the great Catholic
bishop who spent most of his life in North Africa, tells us that his
mother was regularly beaten by his father and that most other wives

in the small town where he grew up had similar bruises to show!
Finally, fathers had substantial legal control over their children –
sometimes to a shocking degree, for example, a legal power of life and
death in exposing unwanted children, by leaving them out in the cold
to die.
What about literacy? It is certain that rates of casual literacy* varied
greatly between different parts of the empire. For example, in Pompeii,
which was buried in a volcanic eruption in 79 CE, there is strong evidence
of widespread casual literacy. Walls on the main streets of Pompeii
often carried advertisements, and graffiti were found all over the city.
By contrast, in Egypt where hundreds of papyri survive, most formal
documents such as contracts were usually written by professional
scribes, and they often tell us that X or Y is unable to read and write.
But even here literacy was certainly more widespread among certain
categories such as soldiers, army officers and estate managers.
The cultural diversity of the empire was reflected in many ways and
at many levels: in the vast diversity of religious cults and local deities;
the plurality of languages that were spoken; the styles of dress and
costume, the food people ate, their forms of social
organisation (tribal/non-tribal), even their patterns
of settlement. Aramaic was the dominant language
group of the Near East (at least west of the Euphrates),
Coptic was spoken in Egypt, Punic and Berber in
North Africa, Celtic in Spain and the northwest. But
many of these linguistic cultures were purely oral, at
least until a script was invented for them. Armenian,
for example, only began to be written as late as the
fifth century, whereas there was already a Coptic

translation of the Bible by the middle of the third century. Elsewhere,
the spread of Latin displaced the written form of languages that were
otherwise widespread; this happened notably with Celtic, which ceased
to be written after the first century.
Economic Expansion
The empire had a substantial economic infrastructure of harbours,
mines, quarries, brickyards, olive oil factories, etc. Wheat, wine and
olive-oil were traded and consumed in huge quantities, and they came
mainly from Spain, the Gallic provinces, North Africa, Egypt and, to a
lesser extent, Italy, where conditions were best for these crops. Liquids
like wine and olive oil were transported in containers called ‘amphorae’.
The fragments and sherds of a very large number of these survive
(Monte Testaccio in Rome is said to contain the remnants of over 50
million vessels!), and it has been possible for archaeologists to
reconstruct the precise shapes of these containers, tell us what they
carried, and say exactly where they were made by examining the clay
content and matching the finds with clay pits throughout the
Mediterranean. In this way we can now say with some confidence that
Spanish olive oil, to take just one example, was a vast commercial
enterprise that reached its
peak in the years 140-160.
The Spanish olive oil of this
period was mainly carried in a
container called ‘Dressel 20’

regions competed with each other for control of the main markets for
the goods they produced. The success of the Spanish olive growers
was then repeated by North African producers – olive estates in this
part of the empire dominated production through most of the third
and fourth centuries. Later, after 425, North African dominance was
broken by the East: in the later fifth and sixth centuries the Aegean,
southern Asia Minor (Turkey), Syria and Palestine became major
exporters of wine and olive oil, and containers from Africa show a
dramatically reduced presence on Mediterranean markets. Behind these
broad movements the prosperity of individual regions rose and fell
depending on how effectively they could organise the production and
transport of particular goods, and on the quality of those goods.
The empire included many regions that had a reputation for
exceptional fertility. Campania in Italy, Sicily, the Fayum in Egypt,
Galilee, Byzacium (Tunisia), southern Gaul (called Gallia Narbonensis),
and Baetica (southern Spain) were all among the most densely settled
or wealthiest parts of the empire, according to writers like Strabo and
Pliny. The best kinds of wine came from Campania. Sicily and Byzacium
exported large quantities of wheat to Rome. Galilee was densely
cultivated (‘every inch of the soil has been cultivated by the inhabitants’,
wrote the historian Josephus), and Spanish olive oil came mainly from
numerous estates (fundi) along the banks of the river Guadalquivir in
the south of Spain.
On the other hand, large expanses of Roman territory were in a
much less advanced state. For example, transhumance* was widespread
in the countryside of Numidia (modern Algeria). These pastoral and
semi-nomadic communities were often on the move, carrying their
oven-shaped huts (called mapalia) with them. As Roman estates
expanded in North Africa, the pastures of those communities were
drastically reduced and their movements more tightly regulated. Even
in Spain the north was much less developed, and inhabited largely by
a Celtic-speaking peasantry that lived in hilltop villages called castella.
When we think of the Roman Empire, we should never forget these
differences.
We should also be careful not to imagine that because this was the
‘ancient’ world, their forms of cultural and economic life were necessarily
backward or primitive. On the contrary, diversified applications of water
power around the Mediterranean as well as advances in water-powered
milling technology, the use of hydraulic mining techniques in the
Spanish gold and silver mines and the gigantic industrial scale on
which those mines were worked in the first and second centuries (with
levels of output that would not be reached again till the nineteenth
century, some 1,700 years later!), the existence of well-organised
commercial and banking networks, and the widespread use of money
are all indications of how much we tend to under-estimate the
sophistication of the Roman economy. This raises the issue of labour
and of the use of slavery.

68 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Controlling Workers
Slavery was an institution deeply rooted in the ancient world, both in
the Mediterranean and in the Near East, and not even Christianity
when it emerged and triumphed as the state religion (in the fourth
century) seriously challenged this institution. It does
not follow that the bulk of the labour in the Roman
economy was performed by slaves. That may have
been true of large parts of Italy in the Republican
period (under Augustus there were still 3 million
slaves in a total Italian population of 7.5 million) but
it was no longer true of the empire as a whole. Slaves
were an investment, and at least one Roman
agricultural writer advised landowners against using
them in contexts where too many might be required
(for example, for harvests) or where their health could
be damaged (for example, by malaria). These
considerations were not based on any sympathy for
the slaves but on hard economic calculation. On the
other hand, if the Roman upper classes were often
brutal towards their slaves, ordinary people did
sometimes show much more compassion. See what
one historian says about a famous incident that
occurred in the reign of Nero.
As warfare became less widespread with the
establishment of peace in the first century, the supply
of slaves tended to decline and the users of slave
labour thus had to turn either to slave breeding* or
to cheaper substitutes such as wage labour which
was more easily dispensable. In fact, free labour was
extensively used on public works at Rome precisely
because an extensive use of slave labour would have
been too expensive. Unlike hired workers, slaves had
to be fed and maintained throughout the year, which increased the
cost of holding this kind of labour. This is probably why slaves are not
widely found in the agriculture of the later period, at least not in the
eastern provinces. On the other hand, they and freedmen, that is,
slaves who had been set free by their masters, were extensively used
as business managers, where, obviously, they were not required in
large numbers. Masters often gave their slaves or freedmen capital to
run businesses on their behalf or even businesses of their own.
The Roman agricultural writers paid a great deal of attention to the
management of labour. Columella, a first-century writer who came
from the south of Spain, recommended that landowners should keep
a reserve stock of implements and tools, twice as many as they needed,
so that production could be continuous, ‘for the loss in slave labour-
time exceeds the cost of such items’. There was a general presumption

On the Treatment of Slaves
‘Soon afterwards the City Prefect,
Lucius Pedanius Secundus, was
murdered by one of his slaves. After
the murder, ancient custom
required that every slave residing
under the same roof must be
executed. But a crowd gathered,
eager to save so many innocent
lives; and rioting began. The
senate-house was besieged. Inside,
there was feeling against excessive
severity, but the majority opposed
any change (….) [The senators]
favouring execution prevailed.
However, great crowds ready with
stones and torches prevented the
order from being carried out. Nero
rebuked the population by edict,
and lined with troops the whole
route

among employers that without
supervision no work would ever get
done, so supervision was paramount,
for both free workers and slaves. To
make supervision easier, workers
were sometimes grouped into gangs
or smaller teams. Columella
recommended squads of ten,
claiming it was easier to tell who was
putting in effort and who was not in
work groups of this size. This shows
a detailed consideration of the
management of labour. Pliny the
Elder, the author of a very famous
‘Natural History’, condemned the use
of slave gangs as the worst method
of organising production, mainly
because slaves who worked in gangs
were usually chained together by
their feet.
All this looks draconian*, but we
should remember that most factories
in the world today enforce similar
principles of labour control. Indeed,
some industrial establishments in
the empire enforced even tighter
controls. The Elder Pliny described
conditions in the frankincense**
factories (officinae) of Alexandria, where, he tells us, no amount of
supervision seemed to suffice. ‘A seal is put upon the workmen’s aprons,
they have to wear a mask or a net with a close mesh on their heads,
and before they are allowed to leave the premises, they have to take off
all their clothes.’ Agricultural labour must have been fatiguing and
disliked, for a famous edict of the early third century refers to Egyptian
peasants deserting their villages ‘in order not to engage in agricultural
work’. The same was probably true of most factories and workshops.
A law of 398 referred to workers being branded so they could be
recognised if and when they run away and try to hide. Many private
employers cast their agreements with workers in the form of debt
contracts to be able to claim that their employees were in debt to them
and thus ensure tighter control over them. An early, second-century
writer tells us, ‘Thousands surrender themselves to work in servitude,
although they are free.’ In other words, a lot of the poorer families went
into debt bondage in order to survive. From one of the recently
discovered letters of Augustine we learn that parents sometimes sold
their children into servitude for periods of 25 years. Augustine asked
a lawyer friend of his whether these children could be liberated once

the father died. Rural indebtedness was even more widespread; to take
just one example, in the great Jewish revolt of 66 CE* the revolutionaries
destroyed the moneylenders’ bonds to win popular support.
Again, we should be careful not to conclude that the bulk of labour
was coerced in these ways. The late-fifth-century emperor Anastasius
built the eastern frontier city of Dara in less than three weeks by
attracting labour from all over the East by offering high wages. From
the papyri we can even form some estimate of how widespread wage
labour had become in parts of the Mediterranean by the sixth century,
especially in the East.
Social Hierarchies
Let us stand back from the details now and try and get a sense of the
social structures of the empire. Tacitus described the leading social
groups of the early empire as follows: senators (patres, lit. ‘fathers’);
leading members of the equestrian class; the respectable section of the
people, those attached to the great houses; the unkempt lower class
(plebs sordida) who, he tells us, were addicted to the circus and
theatrical displays; and finally the slaves. In the early third century
when the Senate numbered roughly 1,000, approximately half of all
senators still came from Italian families. By the late empire, which
starts with the reign of Constantine I in the early part of the fourth
century, the first two groups mentioned by Tacitus (the senators and
the equites*) had merged into a unified and expanded aristocracy, and
at least half of all families were of African or eastern origin. This ‘late
Roman’ aristocracy was enormously wealthy but in many ways less
powerful than the purely military elites who came almost entirely from
non-aristocratic backgrounds. The ‘middle’ class now consisted of the
considerable mass of persons connected with imperial service in the
bureaucracy and army but also the more prosperous merchants and
farmers of whom there were many in the eastern provinces. Tacitus
described this ‘respectable’ middle class as clients of the great senatorial
houses. Now it was chiefly government service and dependence on the
State that sustained many of these families. Below them were the vast
mass of the lower classes known collectively as humiliores (lit. ‘lower’).
They comprised a rural labour force of which many were permanently
employed on the large estates; workers in industrial and mining
establishments; migrant workers who supplied much of the labour for
the grain and olive harvests and for the building industry; self-employed
artisans who, it was said, were better fed than wage labourers; a large
mass of casual labourers, especially in the big cities; and of course the
many thousands of slaves that were still found all over the western
empire in particular.
One writer of the early fifth century, the historian Olympiodorus
who was also an ambassador, tells us that the aristocracy based in the
City of Rome drew annual incomes of up to 4,000 lbs of gold from their

estates, not counting the produce they consumed directly!
The monetary system of the late empire broke with the
silver-based currencies of the first three centuries because
the Spanish silver mines were exhausted and government
ran out of sufficient stocks of the metal to support a stable
coinage in silver. Constantine founded the new monetary
system on gold and there were vast amounts of this in
circulation throughout late antiquity.
The late Roman bureaucracy, both the higher and middle
echelons, was a comparatively affluent group because it
drew the bulk of its salary in gold and invested much of
this in buying up assets like land. There was of course also
a great deal of corruption, especially in the judicial system
and in the administration of military supplies. The extortion
of the higher bureaucracy and the greed of the provincial
governors were proverbial. But government intervened
repeatedly to curb these forms of corruption – we only
know about them in the first place because of the laws that
tried to put an end to them, and because historians and
other members of the intelligentsia denounced such
practices. This element of ‘criticism’ is a remarkable feature
of the classical world. The Roman state was an authoritarian
regime; in other words, dissent was rarely tolerated and
government usually responded to protest with violence
(especially in the cities of the East where people were often
fearless in making fun of emperors). Yet a strong tradition
of Roman law had emerged by the fourth century, and this
acted as a brake on even the most fearsome emperors.
Emperors were not free to do whatever they liked, and the
law was actively used to protect civil rights. That is why in
the later fourth century it was possible for powerful bishops like
Ambrose to confront equally powerful emperors when they were
excessively harsh or repressive in their handling of the civilian
population.
Late Antiquity
We shall conclude this chapter by looking at the cultural transformation
of the Roman world in its final centuries. ‘Late antiquity’ is the term
now used to describe the final, fascinating period in the evolution and
break-up of the Roman Empire and refers broadly to the fourth to
seventh centuries. The fourth century itself was one of considerable
ferment, both cultural and economic. At the cultural level, the period
saw momentous developments in religious life, with the emperor
Constantine deciding to make Christianity the official religion, and
with the rise of Islam in the seventh century. But there were equally
important changes in the structure of the state that began with the

emperor Diocletian (284-305), and it may be best to start with these.
Overexpansion had led Diocletian to ‘cut back’ by abandoning
territories with little strategic or economic value. Diocletian also fortified
the frontiers, reorganised provincial boundaries, and separated civilian
from military functions, granting greater autonomy to the military
commanders (duces), who now became a more powerful group.
Constantine consolidated some of these changes and added others of
his own. His chief innovations were in the monetary sphere, where he
introduced a new denomination, the solidus, a coin of 4½ gm of pure
gold that would in fact outlast the Roman Empire itself. Solidi were
minted on a very large scale and their circulation ran into millions. The
other area of innovation was the creation of a second
capital at Constantinople (at the site of modern
Istanbul in Turkey, and previously called
Byzantium), surrounded on three sides by the sea.
As the new capital required a new senate, the fourth
century was a period of rapid expansion of the
governing classes. Monetary stability and an
expanding population stimulated economic growth,
and the archaeological record shows considerable
investment in rural establishments, including
industrial installations like oil presses and glass
factories, in newer technologies such as screw
presses and multiple water-mills, and in a revival
of the long-distance trade with the East.
All of this carried over into strong urban
prosperity that was marked by new forms of
architecture and an exaggerated sense of luxury.
The ruling elites were wealthier and more powerful
than ever before. In Egypt, hundreds of papyri
survive from these later centuries and they show
us a relatively affluent society where money was in
extensive use and rural estates generated vast
incomes in gold. For example, Egypt contributed
taxes of over 2½ million solidi a year (roughly 35,000
lbs of gold) in the reign of Justinian in the sixth
century. Indeed, large parts of the Near Eastern countryside were
more developed and densely settled in the fifth and sixth centuries
than they would be even in the twentieth century! This is the social
background against which we should set the cultural developments of
this period.
The traditional religious culture of the classical world, both Greek
and Roman, had been polytheist. That is, it involved a multiplicity of
cults that included both Roman/Italian gods like Jupiter, Juno, Minerva
and Mars, as well as numerous Greek and eastern deities worshipped
in thousands of temples, shrines and sanctuaries throughout the
empire. Polytheists had no common name or label to describe

themselves. The other great religious tradition in the empire was
Judaism. But Judaism was not a monolith* either, and there was a
great deal of diversity within the Jewish communities of late antiquity.
Thus, the ‘Christianisation’** of the empire in the fourth and fifth
centuries was a gradual and complex process. Polytheism did not
disappear overnight, especially in the western provinces, where the
Christian bishops waged a running battle against beliefs and practices
they condemned more than the Christian laity*** did. The boundaries
between religious communities were much more fluid in the fourth
century than they would become thanks to the repeated efforts of
religious leaders, the powerful bishops who now led the Church, to
rein in their followers and enforce a more rigid set of beliefs and practices.
The general prosperity was especially marked in the East where
population was still expanding till the sixth century, despite the impact of
the plague which affected the Mediterranean in the 540s. In the West, by
contrast, the empire fragmented politically as Germanic groups from the
North (Goths, Vandals, Lombards, etc.) took over all the major provinces
and established kingdoms that are best described as ‘post-Roman’. The
most important of these were that of the Visigoths in Spain, destroyed by
the Arabs between 711 and 720, that of the Franks in Gaul (c.511-687)
and that of the Lombards in Italy (568-774). These kingdoms foreshadowed
the beginnings of a different kind of world that is usually called ‘medieval’.
In the East, where the empire remained united, the reign of Justinian is
the highwater mark of prosperity and imperial ambition. Justinian

recaptured Africa from the Vandals (in 533) but his recovery of Italy (from
the Ostrogoths) left that country devastated and paved the way for the
Lombard invasion. By the early seventh century, the war between Rome
and Iran had flared up again, and the Sasanians who had ruled Iran since
the third century launched a wholesale invasion of all the major eastern
provinces (including Egypt). When Byzantium, as the Roman Empire was
now increasingly known, recovered these provinces in the 620s, it was
just a few years away, literally, from the final major blow which came, this
time, from the south-east.
The expansion of Islam from its beginnings in Arabia has been
called ‘the greatest political revolution ever to occur in the history of
the ancient world’. By 642, barely ten years after Prophet Muhammad’s
death, large parts of both the eastern Roman and Sasanian empires
had fallen to the Arabs in a series of stunning confrontations. However,
we should bear in mind that those conquests, which eventually (a
century later) extended as far afield as Spain, Sind and Central Asia,
began in fact with the subjection of the Arab tribes by the emerging
Islamic state, first within Arabia and then in the Syrian desert and on
the fringes of Iraq. As we will see in Theme 4, the unification of the
Arabian peninsula and its numerous tribes was the key factor behind
the territorial expansion of Islam.

The Central Islamic
Lands
AS we enter the twenty-first century, there are over 1 billion
Muslims living in all parts of the world. They are citizens
of different nations, speak different languages, and dress
differently. The processes by which they became Muslims
were varied, and so were the circumstances in which they
went their separate ways. Yet, the Islamic community has its
roots in a more unified past which unfolded roughly 1,400
years ago in the Arabian peninsula. In this chapter we are
going to read about the rise of Islam and its expansion over a
vast territory extending from Egypt to Afghanistan, the core
area of Islamic civilisation from 600 to 1200. In these
centuries, Islamic society exhibited multiple political and
cultural patterns. The term Islamic is used here not only in
its purely religious sense but also for the overall society and
culture historically associated with Islam. In this society not
everything that was happening originated directly from
religion, but it took place in a society where Muslims and
their faith were recognised as socially dominant. Non-Muslims
always formed an integral, if subordinate, part of this society
as did Jews in Christendom.
Our understanding of the history of the central Islamic lands
between 600 and 1200 is based on chronicles or tawarikh
(which narrate events in order of time) and semi-historical
works, such as biographies (sira), records of the sayings and
doings of the Prophet (hadith) and commentaries on the
Quran (tafsir). The material from which these works were
produced was a large collection of eyewitness reports (akhbar)
transmitted over a period of time either orally or on paper.
The authenticity of each report (khabar) was tested by a
critical method which traced the chain of transmission (isnad)
and established the reliability of the narrator. Although the
method was not foolproof, medieval Muslim writers were more
careful in selecting their information and understanding the
motives of their informants than were their contemporaries
in other parts of the world. On controversial issues, they
reproduced different versions of the same event, as they found
in their sources, leaving the task of judgement to their
readers. Their description of events closer to their own times
is more systematic and analytical and less of a collection of
akhbar. Most of the chronicles and semi-historical works are

in Arabic, the best being the Tarikh of Tabari (d. 923) which
has been translated into English in 38 volumes. Persian
chronicles are few but they are quite detailed in their treatment
of Iran and Central Asia. Christian chronicles, written in
Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic*), are fewer but they throw
interesting light on the history of early Islam. Besides
chronicles, we have legal texts, geographies, travelogues and
literary works, such as stories and poems.
Documentary evidence (fragmentary pieces of writing,
such as official orders or private correspondence) is the
most valuable for writing histories because it does not
consciously refer to events and persons. It comes almost
entirely from Greek and Arabic papyri (good for
administrative history) and the Geniza records. Some
evidence has emerged from archaeological (excavations
done at desert palaces), numismatic (study of coins) and
epigraphic (study of inscriptions) sources which is of great
value for economic history, art history, and for establishing
names and dates.
Proper histories of Islam began to be written in the
nineteenth century by university professors in Germany and
the Netherlands. Colonial interests in the Middle East and
North Africa encouraged French and British researchers to
study Islam as well. Christian priests too paid close attention
to the history of Islam and produced some good work,
although their interest was mainly to compare Islam with
Christianity. These scholars, called Orientalists, are known
for their knowledge of Arabic and Persian and critical
analysis of original texts. Ignaz Goldziher was a Hungarian
Jew who studied at the Islamic college (al-Azhar) in Cairo
and produced path-breaking studies in German of Islamic
law and theology. Twentieth-century historians of Islam have
largely followed the interests and methods of Orientalists.
They have widened the scope of Islamic history by including
new topics, and by using allied disciplines, such as
economics, anthropology and statistics, have refined many
aspects of Orientalist studies. The historiography of Islam
is a good example of how religion can be studied with
modern historical methods by those who may not share the
customs and beliefs of the people they are studying.
The Rise of Islam in Arabia:
Faith, Community and Politics
During 612-32, the Prophet Muhammad preached the worship of a
single God, Allah, and the membership of a single community of believers
(umma). This was the origin of Islam. Muhammad was an Arab by
language and culture and a merchant by profession. Sixth-century
Arab culture was largely confined to the Arabian peninsula and areas
of southern Syria and Mesopotamia.

The Arabs were divided into tribes* (qabila), each led by a chief who
was chosen partly on the basis of his family connections but more for
his personal courage, wisdom and generosity (murawwa). Each tribe
had its own god or goddess, who was worshipped as an idol (sanam) in
a shrine (masjid). Many Arab tribes were nomadic (Bedouins), moving
from dry to green areas (oases) of the desert in search of food (mainly
dates) and fodder for their camels. Some settled in cities and practised
trade or agriculture. Muhammad’s own tribe, Quraysh, lived in Mecca
and controlled the main shrine there, a cube-like structure called Kaba,
in which idols were placed. Even tribes outside Mecca considered the
Kaba holy and installed their own idols at this shrine, making annual
pilgrimages (hajj) to the shrine. Mecca was located on the crossroads
of a trade route between Yemen and Syria which further enhanced the
city’s importance (see Map p. 82). The Meccan shrine was a sanctuary
(haram) where violence was forbidden and protection given to all visitors.
Pilgrimage and commerce gave the nomadic and settled tribes
opportunities to communicate with one another and share their beliefs
and customs. Although the polytheistic Arabs were vaguely familiar
with the notion of a Supreme God, Allah (possibly under the influence
of the Jewish and Christian tribes living in their midst), their attachment
to idols and shrines was more immediate and stronger.
Around 612, Muhammad declared himself to be the messenger
(rasul) of God who had been commanded to preach that Allah alone
should be worshipped. The worship involved simple rituals, such as
daily prayers (salat), and moral principles, such as distributing alms
and abstaining from theft. Muhammad was to found a community
of believers (umma) bound by a common set of religious beliefs. The
community would bear witness (shahada) to the existence of the
religion before God as well as before members of other religious
communities. Muhammad’s message particularly appealed to those
Meccans who felt deprived of the gains from trade and religion and
were looking for a new community identity. Those who
accepted the doctrine were called Muslims. They
were promised salvation on the Day of Judgement
(qiyama) and a share of the resources of the
community while on earth. The Muslims soon
faced considerable opposition from affluent
Meccans who took offence to the rejection of
their deities and found the new religion a
threat to the status and prosperity of Mecca.

Islamic Calendar
The Hijri era was established during the caliphate of Umar, with the first year
falling in 622 CE. A date in the Hijri calendar is followed by the letters AH.
The Hijri year is a lunar year of 354 days, 12 months (Muharram to Dhul
Hijja) of 29 or 30 days. Each day begins at sunset and each month with the
sighting of the crescent moon. The Hijri year is about 11 days shorter than the
solar year. Therefore, none of the Islamic religious festivals, including the
Ramazan fast, Id and hajj, corresponds in any way to seasons. There is no easy
way to match the dates in the Hijri calendar with the dates in the Gregorian
calendar (established by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 CE). One can calculate the
rough equivalents between the Islamic (H) and Gregorian Christian (C) years
with the following formulae:
(H × 32 / 33) + 622 = C
(C – 622) × 33 / 32 = H
The survival of a religion rests on the survival
of the community of believers. The community
has to be consolidated internally and protected
from external dangers. Consolidation and
protection require political institutions such
as states and governments which are either
inherited from the past, borrowed from outside
or created from scratch. In Medina,
Muhammad created a political order from all
three sources which gave his followers the
protection they needed as well as resolved the
city’s ongoing civil strife. The umma was
converted into a wider community to include
polytheists and the Jews of Medina under the
political leadership of Muhammad.
Muhammad consolidated the faith for his
followers by adding and refining rituals (such
as fasting) and ethical principles. The
community survived on agriculture and trade,
as well as an alms tax (zakat). In addition, the
Muslims organised expeditionary raids (ghazw)
on Meccan caravans and nearby oases. These
raids provoked reactions from the Meccans and
caused a breach with the Jews of Medina. After

a series of battles, Mecca was conquered and Muhammad’s reputation
as a religious preacher and political leader spread far and wide.
Muhammad now insisted on conversion as the sole criterion for
membership of the community. In the harsh conditions of the desert,
the Arabs attached great value to strength and solidarity. Impressed by
Muhammad’s achievements, many tribes, mostly Bedouins, joined the
community by converting to Islam. Muhammad’s alliances began to
spread until they embraced the whole of Arabia. Medina became the
administrative capital of the emerging Islamic state with Mecca as its
religious centre. The Kaba was cleansed of idols as Muslims were required
to face the shrine when offering prayers. In a short space of time,
Muhammad was able to unite a large part of Arabia under a new faith,
community and state. The early Islamic polity, however, remained a
federation of Arab tribes and clans for a long time.
The Caliphate: Expansion, Civil Wars and
Sect Formation
After Muhammad’s death in 632, no one could legitimately claim to be
the next prophet of Islam. As a result, his political authority was
transferred to the umma with no established principle of succession.
This created opportunities for innovations but also caused deep divisions
among the Muslims. The biggest innovation was the creation of the
institution of caliphate, in which the leader of the community (amir al-
muminin) became the deputy (khalifa) of the Prophet. The first four
caliphs (632-61) justified their powers on the basis of their close
association with the Prophet and continued his work under the general
guidelines he had provided. The twin objectives of the caliphate were to
retain control over the tribes constituting the umma and to raise
resources for the state.
Following Muhammad’s death, many tribes broke away from the
Islamic state. Some even raised their own prophets to establish
communities modelled on the umma. The first caliph, Abu Bakr,
suppressed the revolts by a series of campaigns. The second caliph,
Umar, shaped the umma’s policy of expansion of power. The caliph
knew that the umma could not be maintained out of the modest
income derived from trade and taxes. Realising that rich booty
(ghanima) could be obtained from expeditionary raids, the caliph and
his military commanders mustered their tribal strength to conquer
lands belonging to the Byzantine Empire in the west and the Sasanian
empire in the east. At the height of their power, the Byzantine and
Sasanian empires ruled vast territories and commanded huge
resources to pursue their political and commercial interests in Arabia.
The Byzantine Empire promoted Christianity and the Sasanian empire
patronised Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Iran. On the eve of
the Arab invasions, these two empires had declined in strength due
to religious conflicts and revolts by the aristocracy. This made it

easier for the Arabs to annex territories through wars and treaties. In
three successful campaigns (637-642), the Arabs brought Syria, Iraq,
Iran and Egypt under the control of Medina. Military strategy, religious
fervour and the weakness of the opposition contributed to the success
of the Arabs. Further campaigns were launched by the third caliph,
Uthman, to extend the control to Central Asia. Within a decade of the
death of Muhammad, the Arab-Islamic state controlled the vast
territory between the Nile and the Oxus. These lands remain under
Muslim rule to this day.
In all the conquered provinces, the caliphs imposed a new
administrative structure headed by governors (amirs) and tribal
chieftains (ashraf ). The central treasury (bait al-mal) obtained its
revenue from taxes paid by Muslims as well as its share of the booty
from raids. The caliph’s soldiers, mostly Bedouins, settled in camp
cities at the edge of the desert, such as Kufa and Basra, to remain
within reach of their natural habitat as well as the caliph’s command.
The ruling class and soldiers received shares of the booty and monthly
payments (ata). The non-Muslim population retained their rights to
property and religious practices on payment of taxes (kharaj and jiziya).
Jews and Christians were declared protected subjects of the state
(dhimmis) and given a large measure of autonomy in the conduct of
their communal affairs.

Political expansion and unification did not come easily to the Arab
tribesmen. With territorial expansion, the unity of the umma became
threatened by conflicts over the distribution of resources and offices.
The ruling class of the early Islamic state comprised almost entirely
the Quraysh of Mecca. The third caliph, Uthman (644-56), also a
Quraysh, packed his administration with his own men to secure greater
control. This further intensified the Meccan character of the state and
the conflict with the other tribesmen. Opposition in Iraq and Egypt,
combined with opposition in Medina, led to the assassination of
Uthman. With Uthman’s death, Ali became the fourth caliph.
The rifts among the Muslims deepened after Ali (656-61) fought two
wars against those who represented the Meccan aristocracy. Ali’s
supporters and enemies later came to form the two main sects of
Islam: Shias and Sunnis. Ali established himself at Kufa and defeated
an army led by Muhammad’s wife, Aisha, in the Battle of the Camel
(657). He was, however, not able to suppress the faction led by Muawiya,
a kinsman of Uthman and the governor of Syria. Ali’s second battle, at
Siffin (northern Mesopotamia), ended in a truce which split his followers
into two groups: some remained loyal to him, while others left the
camp and came to be known as Kharjis. Soon after, Ali was assassinated
by a Kharji in a mosque at Kufa. After his death, his followers paid
allegiance to his son, Hussain, and his descendants. Muawiya made
himself the next caliph in 661, founding the Umayyad dynasty which
lasted till 750.
After the civil wars, it appeared as if Arab domination would
disintegrate. There were also signs that the tribal conquerors were
adopting the sophisticated culture of their subjects. It was under the
Umayyads, a prosperous clan of the Quraysh tribe, that a second
round of consolidation took place.
The Umayyads and the Centralisation of Polity
The conquest of large territories destroyed the caliphate based in Medina
and replaced it with an increasingly authoritarian polity. The Umayyads
implemented a series of political measures which consolidated their
leadership within the umma. The first Umayyad caliph, Muawiya, moved
his capital to Damascus and adopted the court ceremonies and
administrative institutions of the Byzantine Empire. He also introduced
hereditary succession and persuaded the leading Muslims to accept
his son as his heir. These innovations were adopted by the caliphs who
followed him, and allowed the Umayyads to retain power for 90 years
and the Abbasids, for two centuries.
The Umayyad state was now an imperial power, no longer based
directly on Islam but on statecraft and the loyalty of Syrian troops.
There were Christian advisers in the administration, as well as
Zoroastrian scribes and bureaucrats. However, Islam continued to
provide legitimacy to their rule. The Umayyads always appealed for

unity and suppressed rebellions
in the name of Islam. They also
retained their Arab social
identity. During the reign of Abd
al-Malik (685-705) and his
successors, both the Arab and
Islamic identities were strongly
emphasised.
Among
measures Abd al-Malik took were
the adoption of Arabic as the
language of administration and
the introduction of an Islamic
coinage. The gold dinar and
silver dirham that had been
circulating in the caliphate were
copies of Byzantine and Iranian
coins (denarius and drachm), with symbols of crosses and fire altars
and Greek and Pahlavi (the language of Iran) inscriptions. These symbols
were removed and the coins now carried Arabic inscriptions. Abd al-
Malik also made a highly visible contribution to the development of an
Arab-Islamic identity, by building the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.
Abd al-Malik’s Coinage Reform
The three coin specimens show the transition from Byzantine to
Arab-Islamic coinage. On the second coin, the bearded and long-
haired caliph is dressed in traditional Arab robes and is holding a
sword. It is the first extant portrait of a Muslim. It is also unique
because later there developed an antipathy towards the
representation of living beings in art and craft. Abd al-Malik’s reform
of coinage was linked with his reorganisation of state finances. It
proved so successful that for hundreds of years, coins were struck
according to the pattern and weight of the third specimen.

The Abbasid Revolution
For their success in centralising the Muslim polity, the Umayyads
paid a heavy price. A well-organised movement, called dawa, brought
down the Umayyads and replaced them with another family of
Meccan origin, the Abbasids, in 750. The Abbasids portrayed the
Umayyad regime as evil and promised a restoration of the original
Islam of the Prophet. The revolution led not only to a change of
dynasty but changes in the political structure and culture of Islam.
The Abbasid uprising broke out in the distant region of Khurasan
(eastern Iran), a 20-day journey from Damascus on a fast horse.
Khurasan had a mixed Arab-Iranian population which could be
mobilised for various reasons. The Arab soldiers here were mostly
from Iraq and resented the dominance of the Syrians. The civilian
Arabs of Khurasan disliked the Umayyad regime for having made
promises of tax concessions and privileges which were
never fulfilled. As for the Iranian Muslims (mawali), they
were exposed to the scorn of the race-conscious
Arabs and were eager to join any campaign to oust
the Umayyads.
The Abbasids, descendants of Abbas, the Prophet’s
uncle, mustered the support of the various dissident
groups and legitimised their bid for power by promising
that a messiah (mahdi) from the family of the Prophet
(ahl al-bayt) would liberate them from the oppressive
Umayyad regime. Their army was led by an Iranian
slave, Abu Muslim, who defeated the last Umayyad
caliph, Marwan, in a battle at the river Zab.
Under Abbasid rule, Arab influence declined,
while the importance of Iranian culture increased.
The Abbasids established their capital at Baghdad,
near the ruins of the ancient Iranian metropolis,
Ctesiphon. The army and bureaucracy were
reorganised on a non-tribal basis to ensure
greater participation by Iraq and Khurasan. The
Abbasid rulers strengthened the religious
status and functions of the caliphate and
patronised Islamic institutions and
scholars. But they were forced by the
needs of government and empire to
retain the centralised nature of the
state. They maintained the magnificent
imperial architecture and elaborate
court ceremonials of the Umayyads.
The regime which took pride in having
brought down the monarchy found
itself compelled to establish it again.

86 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Break-up of the Caliphate and the Rise of
Sultanates
The Abbasid state became weaker from the ninth century because
Baghdad’s control over the distant provinces declined, and because of
conflict between pro-Arab and pro-Iranian factions in the army and
bureaucracy. In 810, a civil war broke out between supporters of Amin
and Mamun, sons of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, which deepened the
factionalism and created a new power bloc of Turkish slave officers
(mamluk). Shiism once again competed with Sunni orthodoxy for power.
A number of minor dynasties arose, such as the Tahirids and Samanids
in Khurasan and Transoxiana (Turan or lands beyond the Oxus), and
the Tulunids in Egypt and Syria. Abbasid power was soon limited to
central Iraq and western Iran. That too was lost in 945 when the
Buyids, a Shiite clan from the Caspian region of Iran (Daylam), captured
Baghdad. The Buyid rulers assumed various titles, including the ancient
Iranian title shahanshah (king of kings), but not that of caliph. They
kept the Abbasid caliph as the symbolic head of their Sunni subjects.
The decision not to abolish the caliphate was a shrewd one, because
another Shiite dynasty, the Fatimids, had ambitions to rule the Islamic
world. The Fatimids belonged to the Ismaili sub-sect of Shiism and
claimed to be descended from the Prophet’s daughter, Fatima, and
hence, the sole rightful rulers of Islam. From their base in North Africa,
they conquered Egypt in 969 and established the Fatimid caliphate.
The old capital of Egypt, Fustat, was replaced by a new city, Qahira
(Cairo), founded on the day of the rise of the planet Mars (Mirrikh, also
called al-Qahir). The two rival dynasties patronised Shiite administrators,
poets and scholars.
Between 950 and 1200, Islamic society was held together not by a
single political order or a single language of culture (Arabic) but by
common economic and cultural patterns. Unity in the face of political
divisions was maintained by the separation between state and society,
the development of Persian as a language of Islamic high culture, and
the maturity of the dialogue between intellectual traditions. Scholars,
artists and merchants moved freely within the central Islamic lands
and assured the circulation of ideas and manners. Some of these also
percolated down to the level of villages due to conversion. The Muslim
population, less than 10 per cent in the Umayyad and early Abbasid
periods, increased enormously. The identity of Islam as a religion and
a cultural system separate from other religions became much sharper,
which made conversion possible and meaningful.
A third ethnic group was added to the Arabs and Iranians, with the
rise of the Turkish sultanates in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The
Turks were nomadic tribes from the Central Asian steppes (grasslands)
of Turkistan (north-east of the Aral Sea up to the borders of China)
who gradually converted to Islam (see Theme 5). They were skilled
riders and warriors and entered the Abbasid, Samanid and Buyid

administrations as slaves and soldiers, rising to high positions on
account of their loyalty and military abilities. The Ghaznavid sultanate
was established by Alptegin (961) and consolidated by Mahmud of
Ghazni (998-1030). Like the Buyids, the Ghaznavids were a military
dynasty with a professional army of Turks and Indians (one of the
generals of Mahmud was an Indian named Tilak). But their centre of
power was in Khurasan and Afghanistan and for them, the Abbasid
caliphs were not rivals but a source of legitimacy. Mahmud was
conscious of being the son of a slave and was especially eager to receive
the title of Sultan from the caliph. The caliph was willing to support
the Sunni Ghaznavid as a counterweight to Shiite power.
The Saljuq Turks entered Turan as soldiers in the armies of the
Samanids and Qarakhanids (non-Muslim Turks from further east).
They later established themselves as a powerful group under the
leadership of two brothers, Tughril and Chaghri Beg. Taking
advantage of the chaos following the death of Mahmud of Ghazni,
the Saljuqs conquered Khurasan in 1037 and made Nishapur* their
first capital. The Saljuqs next turned their attention to western
Persia and Iraq (ruled by the Buyids) and in 1055, restored Baghdad
to Sunni rule. The caliph, al-Qaim, conferred on Tughril Beg the
title of Sultan in a move that marked the separation of religious and
political authority. The two Saljuq brothers ruled together in
accordance with the tribal notion of rule by the family as a whole.
Tughril (d. 1064) was succeeded by his nephew, Alp Arsalan.
During Alp Arsalan’s reign, the Saljuq empire expanded to Anatolia
(modern Turkey).
From the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, there was a series of
conflicts between European Christians and the Arab states. This is
discussed below. Then, at the start of the thirteenth century, the
Muslim world found itself on the verge of a great disaster. This was the
threat from the Mongols, the last but most decisive of all nomadic
assaults on settled civilisations (see Theme 5).
The Crusades
In medieval Islamic societies, Christians were regarded as the People of
the Book (ahl al-kitab) since they had their own scripture (the New
Testament or Injil). Christians were granted safe conduct (aman) while
venturing into Muslim states as merchants, pilgrims, ambassadors
and travellers. These territories also included those which were once
held by the Byzantine Empire, notably the Holy Land of Palestine.
Jerusalem was conquered by the Arabs in 638 but it was ever-present
in the Christian imagination as the place of Jesus’ crucifixion and
resurrection. This was an important factor in the formation of the
image of Muslims in Christian Europe.
Hostility towards the Muslim world became more pronounced in
the eleventh century. Normans, Hungarians and some Slavs had

been converted to Christianity, and the Muslims alone remained as
the main enemy. There was also a change in the social and economic
organisation of western Europe in the eleventh century which
contributed to the hostility between Christendom and the Islamic
world. The clergy and the warrior class (the first two orders – see
Theme 6) were making efforts to ensure political stability as well as
economic growth based on agriculture and trade. The possibilities
of military confrontation between competing feudal principalities
and a return to economic organisation based on plunder were
contained by the Peace of God movement. All military violence was
forbidden inside certain areas, near places of worship, during certain
periods considered sacred in
the Church’s calendar, and
against certain vulnerable
social groups, such as
churchmen and the common
people. The Peace of God
deflected the aggressive
tendencies of feudal society
away from the Christian world
and towards the ‘enemies’ of
God. It built a climate in which
fighting against the infidels
(non-believers) became not
only permissible but also
commendable.
The death in 1092 of Malik
Shah, the Saljuq sultan of
Baghdad, was followed by the
disintegration of his empire.
This offered the Byzantine
emperor, Alexius I, a chance
to regain Asia Minor and
northern Syria. For Pope
Urban II, this was an
opportunity to revive the spirit
of Christianity. In 1095, the
Pope joined the Byzantine
emperor in calling for a war in
the name of God to liberate the
Holy Land. Between 1095 and

wars against Muslim cities on the coastal plains of the eastern
Mediterranean (Levant). These wars were later designated as
Crusades*.
In the first crusade (1098-99), soldiers from France and Italy
captured Antioch in Syria, and claimed Jerusalem. Their victory
was accompanied by the slaughter of Muslims and Jews in the city,
chronicled by both Christians and Muslims. Muslim writers referred
to the arrival of the Christians (called ifrinji or firangi) as a Frankish
invasion. The Franks quickly established four crusader states in
the region of Syria-Palestine. Collectively, these territories were
known as Outremer (the land overseas) and later crusades were
directed at its defence and expansion.
The Outremer survived well for some time, but when the Turks
captured Edessa in 1144, an appeal was made by the Pope for a
second crusade (1145-49). A combined German and French army
made an attempt to capture Damascus but they were defeated and
forced to return home. After this, there was a gradual erosion of the
strength of Outremer. Crusader zeal gave way to living in luxury
and to battles over territory among the Christian rulers. Salah al-
Din (Saladin) created an Egypto-Syrian empire and gave the call for
jihad or holy war against the Christians, and defeated them in 1187.
He regained Jerusalem, nearly a century after the first crusade.
Records of the time indicate that Salah al-Din’s treatment of the
Christian population was humane, in marked contrast to the way in
which Christians had earlier dealt with Muslims and Jews. Although
he gave custody of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to the
Christians, a number of churches were turned into mosques, and
Jerusalem once again became a Muslim city.
The loss of the city prompted a third crusade in 1189, but the
crusaders gained little except for some coastal towns in Palestine
and free access to Jerusalem for Christian pilgrims. The Mamluks,
the rulers of Egypt, finally drove the crusading Christians from all
of Palestine in 1291. Europe gradually lost military interest in Islam
and focused on its internal political and cultural development.
The Crusades left a lasting impact on two aspects of Christian-
Muslim relations. One was the harsher attitude of the Muslim state
towards its Christian subjects which resulted from the bitter
memories of the conflict as well as the needs for security in areas of
mixed populations. The other was the greater influence of Italian
mercantile communities (from Pisa, Genoa and Venice) in the trade
between the East and the West even after the restoration of
Muslim power.

Franks in Syria
The treatment of the subjugated Muslim population differed among the various Frankish
lords. The earliest of the crusaders, who settled down in Syria and Palestine, were generally
more tolerant of the Muslim population than those who came later. In his memoirs,
Usama ibn Munqidh, a twelfth-century Syrian Muslim, has something interesting to say
about his new neighbours:
‘Among the Franks there are some who have settled down in this country and associated
with Muslims. These are better than the newcomers, but they are exceptions to the
rule, and no inference can be drawn from them.
Here is an example. Once I sent a man to Antioch on business. At that time,
Chief Theodore Sophianos [an
eastern Christian] was there, and
he and I were friends. He was then
all powerful in Antioch. One day
he said to my man, ‘‘One of my
Frankish friends has invited me.
Come with me and see how they
live.’’ My man told me: “So I went
with him, and we came to the
house of one of the old knights,
those who had come with the first
Frankish expedition. He had
already retired from state and
military service, and had a
property in Antioch from which he
lived. He produced a fine table,
with food both tasty and cleanly
served. He saw that I was reluctant
to eat, and said: “Eat to your heart’s
content, for I do not eat Frankish
food. I have Egyptian women cooks and eat nothing but what they prepare, nor
does swine flesh ever enter my house.” So I ate, but with some caution, and we took
our leave.
Later I was walking through the market, when suddenly a Frankish woman caught
hold of me and began jabbering in their language, and I could not understand what
she was saying. A crowd of Franks collected against me, and I was sure that my end
had come. Then, suddenly, that same knight appeared and saw me, and came up to
that woman, and asked her: “What do you want of this Muslim?” She replied: “He
killed my brother Hurso.” This Hurso was a knight of Afamiya who had been killed
by someone from the army of Hama. Then the knight shouted at her and said, “This
man is a burjasi [bourgeois, that is, a merchant]. He does not fight or go to war.” And
he shouted at the crowd and they dispersed; then he took my hand and went away.
So the effect of that meal that I had was to save me from death.” ’

Economy: Agriculture, Urbanisation and
Commerce
Agriculture was the principal occupation of the settled populations in
the newly conquered territories. The Islamic state made no changes in
this. Land was owned by big and small peasants and, in some cases,
by the state. In Iraq and Iran, land existed in fairly large units cultivated
by peasants. The estate owners collected taxes on behalf of the state
during the Sasanian as well as Islamic periods. In areas that had
moved from a pastoral to a settled agricultural system, land was the
common property of the village. Finally, big estates that were abandoned
by their owners after the Islamic conquests were acquired by the state
and handed over mainly to the Muslim elites of the empire, particularly
members of the caliph’s family.
The state had overall control of agricultural lands, deriving the bulk
of its income from land revenue once the conquests were over. The
lands conquered by the Arabs that remained in the hands of the owners
were subject to a tax (kharaj), which
varied from half to a fifth of the
produce, according to the conditions
of cultivation. On land held or
cultivated by Muslims, the tax levied
was one-tenth (ushr) of the produce.
When non-Muslims started to convert
to Islam to pay lower taxes, this
reduced the income of the state. To
address the shortfall, the caliphs first
discouraged conversions and later
adopted a uniform policy of taxation.
From the tenth century onwards, the
state authorised its officials to claim
their salaries from agricultural
revenues from territories, called iqtas
(revenue assignments).
Agricultural prosperity went hand
in hand with political stability. In
many areas, especially in the Nile
valley, the state supported irrigation
systems, the construction of dams and canals, and the digging of wells
(often equipped with waterwheels or noria), all of which were crucial for
good harvests. Islamic law gave tax concessions to people who brought
land under cultivation. Through peasant initiatives and state support,
cultivable land expanded and productivity rose, even in the absence of
major technological changes. Many new crops such as cotton, oranges,
bananas, watermelons, spinach and brinjals (badinjan) were grown
and even exported to Europe.

92 THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Islamic civilisation flourished as the number of cities grew
phenomenally. Many new cities were founded, mainly to settle Arab
soldiers (jund) who formed the backbone of the local administration.
Among this class of garrison-cities, called misr (the Arabic name for
Egypt), were Kufa and Basra in Iraq, and Fustat and Cairo in Egypt.
Within half a century of its establishment as the capital of the Abbasid
caliphate (800), the population of Baghdad had reached around 1 million.
Alongside these cities were older towns such as Damascus, Isfahan
and Samarqand, which received a new lease of life. Their size and
population surged, supported by an expansion in the production of
foodgrains and raw materials such as cotton and sugar for urban
manufactures. A vast urban network developed, linking one town with
another and forming a circuit.
At the heart of the city were two building complexes radiating cultural
and economic power: the congregational mosque (masjid al-jami), big
enough to be seen from a distance, and the central marketplace (suq),
with shops in a row, merchants’ lodgings (fanduq) and the office of the
money-changer. The cities were homes to administrators (ayan or eyes
of the state), and scholars and merchants (tujjar) who lived close to the
centre. Ordinary citizens and soldiers had their living quarters in the
outer circle, each fitted with its own mosque, church or synagogue
(Jewish temple), subsidiary market and public bath (hammam), an
important meeting place. At the outskirts were the houses of the urban
poor, a market for green vegetables and fruits brought from the
countryside, caravan stations and ‘unclean’ shops, such as those dealing
in tanning or butchering. Beyond the city walls were inns for people to
rest when the city gates were shut and cemeteries. There were variations
on this typology depending on the
nature of the landscape, political
traditions and historical events.
Political unification and urban
demand for foodstuffs and luxuries
enlarged the circuit of exchange.
Geography favoured the Muslim
empire, which spread between the
trading zones of the Indian Ocean and
the Mediterranean. For five centuries,
Arab and Iranian traders monopolised
the maritime trade between China, India
and Europe. This trade passed through
two major routes, namely, the Red Sea
and the Persian Gulf. High-value goods
suitable for long-distance trade, such as
spices, textile, porcelain and gunpowder,
were shipped from India and China to
the Red Sea ports of Aden and Aydhab
and the Gulf ports of Siraf and Basra.

From here, the merchandise was carried overland in camel caravans to
the warehouses (makhazin, origin of the word magazine which has a
similar collection of articles) of Baghdad, Damascus and Aleppo for
local consumption or onward transmission. The caravans passing
through Mecca got bigger whenever the hajj coincided with the sailing
seasons (mawasim, origin of the word monsoon) in the Indian Ocean.
At the Mediterranean end of these trade routes, exports to Europe
from the port of Alexandria were handled by Jewish merchants, some
of whom traded directly with India, as can be seen from their letters
preserved in the Geniza collection. However, from the tenth century,
the Red Sea route gained greater importance due to the rise of Cairo as
a centre of commerce and power and growing demand for eastern
goods from the trading cities of Italy.
Paper, Geniza Records and History
In the central Islamic lands, written works were widely circulated after the introduction
of paper. Paper (made from linen) came from China, where the manufacturing process
was a closely guarded secret. In 751, the Muslim governor of Samarqand took 20,000
Chinese invaders as prisoners, some of whom were good at making paper. For the next
100 years, Samarqand paper remained an important export item. Since Islam prohibited
monopolies, paper began to be manufactured in the rest of the Islamic world. By the
middle of the tenth century, it had more or less replaced papyrus, the writing material
made from the inner stem of a plant that grew freely in the Nile valley. Demand for
paper increased, and Abd al-Latif, a doctor from Baghdad (see his depiction of the ideal
student on p. 98) and a resident of Egypt between 1193 and 1207, reported how Egyptian
peasants robbed graves to obtain mummy wrappings made of linen to sell to paper
factories.
Paper also facilitated the writing of commercial and personal documents of all kinds.
In 1896, a huge collection of medieval Jewish documents was discovered in a sealed
room (Geniza, pronounced ghaniza) of the Ben Ezra synagogue in Fustat. The documents
had been preserved thanks to the Jewish practice of not destroying any piece of writing
that contained the name of God. The Geniza was found to contain over a quarter of a
million manuscripts and fragments dating back as far as the mid-eighth century. Most
of the material dated from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, that is, from the Fatimid,
Ayyubid and early Mamluk periods. These included personal letters between merchants,
family and friends, contracts, promises of dowry, sale documents, laundry lists, and
other trivia. Most of the documents were written in Judaeo-Arabic, a version of Arabic
written in Hebrew characters that was commonly used by Jewish communities throughout
the medieval Mediterranean. The Geniza documents provide rich insights into personal
and economic experiences as also into Mediterranean and Islamic culture. The
documents also suggest that the business skills and commercial techniques of merchants
of the medieval Islamic world were more advanced than those of their European
counterparts. Goitein wrote a multi-volume history of the Mediterranean from Geniza
records, and Amitav Ghosh was inspired by a Geniza letter to tell the story of an Indian
slave in his book, In an Antique Land.

Towards the eastern end, caravans of Iranian merchants set out
from Baghdad along the Silk Route to China, via the oasis cities of
Bukhara and Samarqand (Transoxiana), to bring Central Asian and
Chinese goods, including paper. Transoxiana also formed an
important link in the commercial network which extended north to
Russia and Scandinavia for the exchange of European goods, (mainly
fur) and Slavic captives (hence the word, slave). Islamic coins, used
for the payment of these goods, were found in hoards discovered
along the Volga river and in the Baltic region. Male and female Turkish
slaves (ghulam) too were purchased in these markets for the courts
of the caliphs and sultans.
The fiscal system (income and expenditure of the state) and market
exchange increased the importance of money in the central Islamic
lands. Coins of gold, silver and copper (fulus) were minted and
circulated, often in bags sealed by money-changers, to pay for goods
and services. Gold came from Africa (Sudan) and silver from Central
Asia (Zarafshan valley). Precious metals and coins also came from
Europe, which used these to pay for its trade with the East. Rising
demand for money forced people to release their accumulated reserves
and idle wealth into circulation. Credit combined with currencies to
oil the wheels of commerce. The greatest contribution of the Muslim
world to medieval economic life was the development of superior
methods of payment and business organisation. Letters of credit
(sakk, origin of the word cheque) and bills of exchange (suftaja) were
used by merchants and bankers to transfer money from one place
or individual to another. The widespread use of commercial papers
freed merchants from the need to carry cash everywhere and also
made their journeys safer. The caliph too used the sakk to pay
salaries or reward poets and minstrels.
Although it was customary for merchants to set up family
businesses or employ slaves to run their affairs, formal business
arrangements (muzarba) were also common in which sleeping
partners entrusted capital to travelling merchants and shared profits
and losses in an agreed proportion. Islam did not stop people from
making money so long as certain prohibitions were respected. For
instance, interest-bearing transactions (riba) were unlawful, although
people circumvented usury in ingenious ways (hiyal), such as
borrowing money in one type of coin and paying in another while
disguising the interest as a commission on currency exchange (the
origin of the bill of exchange).
Many tales from the Thousand and One Nights (Alf Layla wa Layla)
give us a picture of medieval Islamic society, featuring characters
such as sailors, slaves, merchants and money-changers.

Learning and Culture
As the religious and social experiences of the Muslims deepened
through contact with other people, the community was obliged to
reflect on itself and confront issues pertaining to God and the world.
What should be the ideal conduct of a Muslim in public and private?
What is the object of Creation and how does one know what God
wants from His creatures? How can one understand the mysteries
of the universe? Answers to such questions came from learned
Muslims who acquired and organised knowledge of different kinds
to strengthen the social identity of the community as well as to
satisfy their intellectual curiosity.
For religious scholars (ulama), knowledge (ilm) derived from the
Quran and the model behaviour of the Prophet (sunna) was the only
way to know the will of God and provide guidance in this world. The
ulama in medieval times devoted themselves to writing tafsir and
documenting Muhammad’s authentic hadith. Some went on to
prepare a body of laws or sharia  (the straight path) to govern the
relationship of Muslims with God through rituals (ibadat) and with
the rest of the humanity through social affairs (muamalat). In framing
Islamic law, jurists also made use of reasoning (qiyas) since not
everything was apparent in the Quran or hadith and life had become
increasingly complex with urbanisation. Differences in the
interpretation of the sources and methods of jurisprudence led to
the formation of four schools of law (mazhab) in the eight and ninth
centuries. These were the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafii and Hanbali schools,
each named after a leading jurist (faqih), the last being the most
conservative. The sharia provided guidance on all possible legal issues
within Sunni society, though it was more precise on questions of
personal status (marriage, divorce and inheritance) than on
commercial matters or penal and constitutional issues.

The Quran
‘And if all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean were ink
with seven oceans behind it to add to its supply,
yet would not the words of Allah be exhausted in the writing.’
(Quran, chapter 31, verse 27)
The Quran is a book in Arabic divided into 114 chapters (suras) and arranged in
descending order of length, the shortest being the last. The only exception to
this is the first sura which is a short prayer (al-fatiha or opening). According to
Muslim tradition, the Quran is a collection of messages (revelations) which God
sent to the Prophet Muhammad between 610 and 632, first in Mecca and then
in Medina. The task of compiling these revelations was completed some time in
650. The oldest complete Quran we have today dates from the ninth century.
There are many fragments which are older, the earliest being the verses engraved
on the Dome of the Rock and on coins in the seventh century.
The use of the Quran as a source material for the history of early Islam has
posed some problems. The first is that it is a scripture, a text vested with religious
authority. Theologians generally believed that as the speech of God (kalam
allah), it has to be understood literally, but rationalists among them gave wider
interpretations to the Quran. In 833, the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun imposed
the view (in a trial of faith or mihna) that the Quran is God’s creation rather
than His speech. The second problem is that the Quran very often speaks in
metaphors and, unlike the Old Testament (Tawrit), it does not narrate events
but only refers to them. Medieval Islamic scholars thus had to make sense of
many verses with the help of hadith. Many hadith were written to help the
reading of the Quran.

Before it took its final form, the sharia was adjusted to take into
account the customary laws (urf) of the various regions as well as
the laws of the state on political and social order (siyasa sharia).
Customary laws, however, retained their strength in large parts of
the countryside and continued to bypass the sharia in matters such
as the inheritance of land by daughters. In most regimes, the ruler
or his officials dealt routinely with matters of state security and
sent only selected cases to the qazi (judge). The qazi, appointed by
the state in each city or locality, often acted as an arbitrator in
disputes, rather than as a strict enforcer of the sharia.
A group of religious-minded people in medieval Islam, known as
Sufis, sought a deeper and more personal knowledge of God through
asceticism (rahbaniya) and mysticism. The more society gave itself
up to material pursuits and pleasures, the more the Sufis sought to
renounce the world (zuhd) and rely on God alone (tawakkul). In the
eighth and ninth centuries, ascetic inclinations were elevated to the
higher stage of mysticism (tasawwuf) by the ideas of pantheism
and love. Pantheism is the idea of oneness of God and His creation
which implies that the human soul must
be united with its Maker. Unity with God
can be achieved through an intense love
for God (ishq), which the woman-saint
Rabia of Basra (d. 891) preached in her
poems. Bayazid Bistami (d. 874), an
Iranian Sufi, was the first to teach the
importance of submerging the self (fana)
in God. Sufis used musical concerts
(sama) to induce ecstasy and stimulate
emotions of love and passion.
Sufism is open to all regardless of
religious affiliation, status and gender.
Dhulnun Misri (d. 861), whose grave can
still be seen near the Pyramids in
Egypt, declared before the Abbasid
caliph, al-Mutawakkil, that he ‘learnt
true Islam from an old woman,
and true chivalry from a water carrier’.
By making religion more personal and
less institutional, Sufism gained
popularity and posed a challenge to
orthodox Islam.

philosophers and scientists under the

be found in the Byzantine and Sasanian empires, although they
were slowly dying. In the schools of Alexandria, Syria and
Mesopotamia, once part of Alexander’s empire, Greek philosophy,
mathematics and medicine were taught along with other subjects.
The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs commissioned the translation of
Greek and Syriac books into Arabic by Christian scholars. Translation
became a well-organised activity under al-Mamun, who supported
the Library cum Institute of Science (Bayt al-Hikma) in Baghdad
where the scholars worked. The works of Aristotle, the Elements of
Euclid and Ptolemy’s Almagest were brought to the attention of
Arabic-reading scholars. Indian works on astronomy, mathematics
and medicine were also translated into Arabic during the same period.
These works reached Europe and kindled interest in philosophy and
science.
The Ideal Student
Abd al-Latif, a twelfth-century legal and medical scholar of
Baghdad, talks to his ideal student:
‘I commend you not to learn your sciences from books unaided,
even though you may trust your ability to understand. Resort to
teachers for each science you seek to acquire; and should your teacher
be limited in his knowledge take all that he can offer, until you
find another more accomplished than he. You must venerate and
respect him. When you read a book, make every effort to learn it by
heart and master its meaning. Imagine the book to have
disappeared and that you can dispense with it, unaffected by its
loss. One should read histories, study biographies and the
experiences of nations. By doing this, it will be as though, in his
short life space, he lived contemporaneously with peoples of the
past, was on intimate terms with them, and knew the good and
bad among them. You should model your conduct on that of the
early Muslims. Therefore, read the biography of the Prophet and
follow in his footsteps. You should frequently distrust your nature,
rather than have a good opinion of it, submitting your thoughts to
men of learning and their works, proceeding with caution and
avoiding haste. He who has not endured the stress of study will not
taste the joy of knowledge. When you have finished your study and
reflection, occupy your tongue with the mention of God’s name,
and sing His praises. Do not complain if the world turns its back on
you. Know that learning leaves a trail and a scent proclaiming its
possessor; a ray of light and brightness shining on him, pointing
him out.’

The study of new subjects promoted critical inquiry and had a
profound influence on Islamic intellectual life. Scholars with a
theological bent of mind, such as the group known as Mutazila, used
Greek logic and methods of reasoning (kalam) to defend Islamic beliefs.
Philosophers (falasifa) posed wider questions and provided fresh
answers. Ibn Sina (980-1037), a doctor by profession and a philosopher,
did not believe in the resurrection of the body on the Day of Judgement.
This was met with strong opposition from theologians. His medical
writings were widely read. The most influential was al-Qanun fil Tibb
(Canon of Medicine), a million-word manuscript that lists 760 drugs
sold by the pharmacists of his day and includes notes on his own
experiments conducted in hospitals (bimaristan). The Canon points
out the importance of dietetics (healing through dietary regulation),
the influence of the climate and environment on health and the
contagious nature of some diseases. The Canon was used as a textbook
in Europe, where the author was known as Avicenna (see Theme 7).
Just before his death, the scientist and poet Umar Khayyam was said
to be reading the Canon. His gold toothpick was found between two
pages of the chapter on metaphysics.
In medieval Islamic societies, fine language and a creative imagination
were among the most appreciated qualities in a person. These qualities
raised a person’s communication to the level of adab, a term which
implied literary and cultural refinement. Adab forms of expressions
included poetry (nazm or orderly arrangement) and prose (nathr or
scattered words) which were meant to be memorised and used when
the occasion arose. The most popular poetic composition of pre-Islamic
origin was the ode (qasida), developed by poets of the Abbasid period
to glorify the achievements of their patrons. Poets of Persian origin
revitalised and reinvented Arabic poetry and challenged the cultural
hegemony of the Arabs. Abu Nuwas (d. 815), who was of Persian origin,
broke new ground by composing classical poetry on new themes such
as wine and male love with the intention of celebrating pleasures
forbidden by Islam. After Abu Nuwas, the poets addressed the object
of their passion in the masculine, even if the latter was a woman.
Following the same tradition, the Sufis glorified the intoxication caused
by the wine of mystical love.
By the time the Arabs conquered Iran, Pahlavi, the language of the
sacred books of ancient Iran, was in decay. A version of Pahlavi, known
as New Persian, with a huge Arabic vocabulary, soon developed. The
formation of sultanates in Khurasan and Transoxiana took New Persian
to great cultural heights. The Samanid court poet Rudaki (d. 940) was
considered the father of New Persian poetry, which included new forms
such as the short lyrical poem (ghazal) and the quatrain (rubai, plural
rubaiyyat). The rubai is a four-line stanza in which the first two lines
set the stage, the third is finely poised, and the fourth delivers the
point. In contrast to its form, the subject matter of the rubai is
unrestricted. It can be used to express the beauty of a beloved, praise

a patron, or express the thoughts of the philosopher. The rubai reached
its zenith in the hands of Umar Khayyam (1048-1131), also an
astronomer and mathematician, who lived at various times in Bukhara,
Samarqand and Isfahan.
At the beginning of the eleventh century,
Ghazni became the centre of Persian literary
life. Poets were naturally attracted by the
brilliance of the imperial court. Rulers, too,
realised the importance of patronising arts
and learning for enhancing their prestige.
Mahmud of Ghazni gathered around him a
group of poets who composed anthologies
(diwans) and epic poetry (mathnavi). The
most outstanding was Firdausi (d. 1020),
who took 30 years to complete the
Shahnama (Book of Kings), an epic of 50,000
couplets which has become a masterpiece of
Islamic literature. The Shahnama is a
collection of traditions and legends (the most
popular being that of Rustam), which
poetically depicts Iran from Creation up until
the Arab conquest. It was in keeping with
the Ghaznavid tradition that Persian later
became the language of administration and
culture in India.
The catalogue (Kitab al-Fihrist) of a Baghdad bookseller, Ibn Nadim
(d. 895), describes a large number of works written in prose for the
moral education and amusement of readers. The oldest of these is a
collection of animal fables called Kalila wa Dimna (the names of the
two jackals who were the leading characters) which is the Arabic
translation of a Pahlavi version of the Panchtantra. The most widespread
and lasting literary works are the stories of hero-adventurers such as
Alexander (al-Iskandar) and Sindbad, or those of unhappy lovers such
as Qays (known as Majnun or the Madman). These have developed
over the centuries into oral and written traditions. The Thousand and
One Nights is another collection of stories told by a single narrator,
Shahrzad, to her husband night after night. The collection was originally
in Indo-Persian and was translated into Arabic in Baghdad in the
eighth century. More stories were later added in Cairo during the
Mamluk period. These stories depict human beings of different types
– the generous, the stupid, the gullible, the crafty – and were told to
educate and entertain. In his Kitab al-Bukhala (Book of Misers), Jahiz
of Basra (d. 868) collected amusing anecdotes about misers and also
analysed greed.
From the ninth century onwards, the scope of adab was expanded
to include biographies, manuals of ethics (akhlaq), Mirrors for Princes
(books on statecraft) and, above all, history (tarikh) and geography.

The tradition of history writing was well established in literate Muslim
societies. History books were read by scholars and students as well as
by the broader literate public. For rulers and officials, history provided
a good record of the glories and achievements of a dynasty as well as
examples of the techniques of administration. In the two major historical
works, Ansab al-Ashraf (Genealogies of the Nobles) of Baladhuri
(d. 892) and Tarikh al-Rusul wal Muluk (History of Prophets and Kings)
of Tabari, the whole of human history was treated with the Islamic
period as the focal point. The tradition of local history  writing developed
with the break-up of the caliphate. Books were written in Persian
about dynasties, cities or regions to explore the unity and variety of
the world of Islam.
Geography and travel (rihla) constituted a special branch of adab.
These combined knowledge from Greek, Iranian and Indian books
with the observations of merchants and travellers. In mathematical
geography, the inhabited world was divided into seven climes (singular
iqlim) parallel with the Equator, corresponding to our three continents.
The exact position of each city was determined astronomically.
Muqaddasi’s (d. 1000) descriptive geography, Ahsan al-Taqasim (The
Best Divisions) is a comparative study of the countries and peoples of
the world and a treasure trove of exotic curiosities. Geography and
general history were combined in Muruj al-Dhahab (Golden Meadows)
of Masudi (written in 943) to illustrate the wide variety of worldly
cultures. Alberuni’s famous Tahqiq ma lil-Hind (History of India) was
the greatest attempt by an eleventh-century Muslim writer to look
beyond the world of Islam and
observe what was of value in another
cultural tradition.
By the tenth century, an Islamic world
had emerged which was easily
recognisable by travellers. Religious
buildings were the greatest external
symbols of this world. Mosques, shrines
and tombs from Spain to Central Asia
showed the same basic design – arches,
domes, minarets and open courtyards –
and expressed the spiritual and practical
needs of Muslims. In the first Islamic
century, the mosque acquired a distinct
architectural form (roof supported by
pillars) which transcended regional
variations. The mosque had an open
courtyard (sahn) where a fountain or
pond was placed, leading to a vaulted
hall which could accommodate long lines
of worshippers and the prayer leader
(imam). Two special features were located

inside the hall: a niche (mihrab) in the wall indicating the direction of
Mecca (qibla), and a pulpit (minbar, pronounced mimbar) from where
sermons were delivered during noon prayers on Friday. Attached to
the building was the minaret, a tower used to call the faithful to prayer
at the appointed times and to symbolise the presence of the new faith.
Time was marked in cities and villages by the five daily prayers and
weekly sermons.
The same pattern of construction – of buildings built around a
central courtyard (iwan) – appeared not only in mosques and
mausoleums but also in caravanserais, hospitals and palaces. The
Umayyads built ‘desert palaces’ in oases, such as Khirbat al-Mafjar in
Palestine and Qusayr Amra in Jordan, which served as luxurious
residences and retreats for hunting and pleasure. The palaces, modelled
on Roman and Sasanian architecture, were lavishly decorated with
sculptures, mosaics and paintings of people. The Abbasids built a new
imperial city in Samarra amidst gardens and running waters which is
mentioned in the stories and legends revolving round Harun al-Rashid.
The great palaces of the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad or the Fatimids in
Cairo have disappeared, leaving only traces in literary texts.
The rejection of representing living beings in the religious art of
Islam promoted two art forms: calligraphy (khattati or the art of beautiful
writing) and arabesque (geometric and vegetal designs). Small and big
inscriptions, usually of religious quotations, were used to decorate
architecture. Calligraphic art has been best preserved in manuscripts
of the Quran dating from the eight and ninth centuries. Literary works,
such as the Kitab al-Aghani (Book of Songs), Kalila wa Dimna, and
Maqamat of Hariri, were illustrated with miniature paintings. In
addition, a wide variety of illumination techniques were introduced to
enhance the beauty of a book. Plant and floral designs, based on the
idea of the garden, were used in buildings and book illustrations.
The history of the central Islamic lands brings together three
important aspects of human civilisation: religion, community
and politics. We can see them as three circles which merge and
appear as one in the seventh century. In the next five centuries
the circles separate. Towards the end of our period, the influence
of Islam over state and government was minimal, and politics
involved many things which had no sanction in religion
(kingship, civil wars, etc.). The circles of religion and
community overlapped. The Muslim community was united
in its observance of the sharia in rituals and personal matters.
It was no more governing itself (poltics was a separate circle)
but it was defining its religious identity. The only way the circles
of religion and community could have separated was through the
progressive secularisation of Muslim society. Philosophers and Sufis
advocated this, suggesting that civil society should be made
autonomous, and rituals be replaced by private spirituality.

NOMADIC EMPIRES
THE term ‘nomadic empires’ can appear contradictory:
nomads are arguably quintessential wanderers, organised
in family assemblies with a relatively undifferentiated
economic life and rudimentary systems of political
organisation. The term ‘empire’, on the other hand, carries
with it the sense of a material location, a stability derived
from complex social and economic structures and the
governance of an extensive territorial dominion through an
elaborate administrative system. But the juxtapositions on
which these definitions are framed may be too narrowly and
ahistorically conceived. They certainly collapse when we
study some imperial formations constructed by nomadic
groups.
In Theme 4 we studied state formations in the central
Islamic lands whose origins lay in the Bedouin nomadic
traditions of the Arabian peninsula. This chapter studies a
different group of nomads: the Mongols of Central Asia who
established a transcontinental empire under the leadership
of Genghis Khan, straddling Europe and Asia during the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Relative to the agrarian-
based imperial formations in China, the neighbouring nomads
of Mongolia may have inhabited a humbler, less complex,
social and economic world. But the Central Asian nomadic
societies were not insulated ‘islands’ that were impervious
to historical change. These societies interacted, had an impact
on and learnt from the larger world of which they were very
much a part.
This chapter studies the manner in which the Mongols
under Genghis Khan adapted their traditional social and
political customs to create a fearsome military machine and
a sophisticated method of governance. The challenge of ruling
a dominion spanning a melange of people, economies, and
confessional systems meant that the Mongols could not simply
impose their steppe traditions over their recently annexed
territories. They innovated and compromised, creating a
nomadic empire that had a huge impact on the history of
Eurasia even as it changed the character and composition of
their own society forever.
The steppe dwellers themselves usually produced no
literature, so our knowledge of nomadic societies comes

mainly from chronicles, travelogues and documents produced
by city-based litterateurs. These authors often produced
extremely ignorant and biased reports of nomadic life. The
imperial success of the Mongols, however, attracted many
literati. Some of them produced travelogues of their
experiences; others stayed to serve Mongol masters. These
individuals came from a variety of backgrounds – Buddhist,
Confucian, Christian, Turkish and Muslim. Although not
always familiar with Mongol customs, many of them produced
sympathetic accounts – even eulogies – that challenged and
complicated the otherwise hostile, city-based tirade against
the steppe marauders. The history of the Mongols, therefore,
provides interesting details to question the manner in which
sedentary societies usually characterised nomads as
primitive barbarians*.
Perhaps the most valuable research on the Mongols was
done by Russian scholars starting in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries as the Tsarist regime consolidated its
control over Central Asia. This work was produced within a
colonial milieu and was largely survey notes produced by
travellers, soldiers, merchants and antiquarian scholars. In
the early twentieth century, after the extension of the soviet
republics in the region, a new Marxist historiography argued
that the prevalent mode of production determined the nature
of social relations. It placed Genghis Khan and the emerging
Mongol empire within a scale of human evolution that was
witnessing a transition from a tribal to a feudal mode of
production: from a relatively classless society to one where
there were wide differences between the lord, the owners of
land and the peasant. Despite following such a deterministic
interpretation of history, excellent research on Mongol
languages, their society and culture was carried out by
scholars such as Boris Yakovlevich Vladimirtsov. Others such
as Vasily Vladimirovich Bartold did not quite toe the official
line. At a time when the Stalinist regime was extremely wary
of regional nationalism, Bartold’s sympathetic and positive
assessment of the career and achievements of the Mongols
under Genghis Khan and his successors got him into trouble
with the censors. It severely curtailed the circulation of the
work of the scholar and it was only in the 1960s, during and
after the more liberal Khruschev era, that his writings  were
published in nine volumes.
The transcontinental span of the Mongol empire also meant
that the sources available to scholars are written in a vast
number of languages. Perhaps the most crucial are the
sources in Chinese, Mongolian, Persian and Arabic, but vital
materials are also available in Italian, Latin, French and
Russian. Often the same text was produced in two languages
with differing contents. For example, the Mongolian and
Chinese versions of the earliest narrative on Genghis Khan,
titled Mongqol-un niuèa tobèa’an (The Secret History of the

Mongols) are quite different and the Italian and Latin versions
of Marco Polo’s travels to the Mongol court do not match.
Since the Mongols produced little literature on their own and
were instead ‘written about’ by literati from foreign cultural
milieus, historians have to often double as philologists to
pick out the meanings of phrases for their closest
approximation to Mongol usage. The work of scholars like
Igor de Rachewiltz on The Secret History of the Mongols and
Gerhard Doerfer on Mongol and Turkic terminologies that
infiltrated into the Persian language brings out the difficulties
involved in studying the history of the Central Asian nomads.
As we will notice through the remainder of this chapter,
despite their incredible achievements there is much about
Genghis Khan and the Mongol world empire still awaiting
the diligent scholar’s scrutiny.
Introduction
In the early decades of the thirteenth century the great empires of the
Euro-Asian continent realised the dangers posed to them by the arrival
of a new political power in the steppes of Central Asia: Genghis Khan
(d. 1227) had united the Mongol people. Genghis Khan’s political vision,
however, went far beyond the creation of a confederacy of Mongol

tribes in the steppes of Central Asia: he had a mandate from God to
rule the world. Even though his own lifetime was spent consolidating
his hold over the Mongol tribes, leading and directing campaigns into
adjoining areas in north China, Transoxiana, Afghanistan, eastern
Iran and the Russian steppes, his descendants travelled further afield
to fulfil Genghis Khan’s vision and create the largest empire the world
had ever seen.
It was in the spirit of Genghis Khan’s ideals that his grandson Mongke
(1251-60) warned the French ruler, Louis IX (1226-70): ‘In Heaven
there is only one Eternal Sky, on Earth there is only one Lord, Genghis
Khan, the Son of Heaven…  When by the power of the Eternal Heaven
the whole world from the rising of the sun to its setting shall be at one
in joy and peace, then it will be made clear what we are going to do: if
when you have understood the decree of the Eternal Heaven, you are
unwilling to pay attention and believe it, saying, “Our country is far
away, our mountains are mighty, our sea is vast”, and in this confidence
you bring an army against us, we know what we can do. He who made
easy what was difficult and near what was far off, the Eternal Heaven
knows.’
These were not empty threats and the 1236-41 campaigns of Batu,
another grandson of Genghis Khan, devastated Russian lands up to
Moscow, seized Poland and Hungary and camped outside Vienna. In
the thirteenth century it did seem that the Eternal Sky was on the side
of the Mongols and many parts of China, the Middle East and Europe
saw in Genghis Khan’s conquests of the inhabited world the ‘wrath of
God’, the beginning of the Day of Judgement.
The Capture of Bukhara
Juwaini, a late-thirteenth-century Persian chronicler of the Mongol
rulers of Iran, carried an account of the capture of Bukhara in 1220.
After the conquest of the city, Juwaini reported, Genghis Khan went
to the festival ground where the rich residents of the city were and
addressed them: ‘O’ people know that you have committed great
sins, and that the great ones among you have committed these sins.
If you ask me what proof I have for these words, I say it is because I
am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins,
God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you’… Now
one man had escaped from Bukhara after its capture and had come
to Khurasan. He was questioned about the fate of the city and
replied: ‘They came, they [mined the walls], they burnt, they slew,
they plundered and they departed.’
How did the Mongols create an empire that dwarfed the achievements
of the other ‘World Conqueror’, Alexander? In a pre-industrial age of

poor technological communications, what skills were deployed by the
Mongols to administer and control such a vast dominion? For someone
so self-confidently aware of his moral, divinely-dispensed right to rule,
how did Genghis Khan relate to the diverse social and religious groups
that comprised his dominion? In the making of his imperium what
happened to this plurality? We need to start our discussion, however,
with a humbler set of questions to better comprehend the social and
political background of the Mongols and Genghis Khan: who were the
Mongols? Where did they live? Who did they interact with and how do
we know about their society and politics?
Social and Political Background
The Mongols were a diverse body of people, linked by similarities of language
to the Tatars, Khitan and Manchus to the east, and the Turkic tribes to
the west. Some of the Mongols were pastoralists while others were hunter-
gatherers. The pastoralists tended horses, sheep and, to a lesser extent,
cattle, goats and camels. They nomadised in the steppes of Central Asia
in a tract of land in the area of the modern state of Mongolia. This was
(and still is) a majestic landscape with wide horizons, rolling plains, ringed
by the snow-capped Altai mountains to the west, the arid Gobi desert in
the south and drained by the Onon and Selenga rivers and myriad springs
from the melting snows of the hills in the north and the west. Lush,
luxuriant grasses for pasture and considerable small game were available
in a good season. The hunter-gatherers resided to the north of the
Onon river plain in

pastoralists in the Siberian forests. They were a humbler body of people
than the pastoralists, making a living from trade in furs of animals trapped
in the summer months. There were extremes of temperature in the entire
region: harsh, long winters followed by brief, dry summers. Agriculture
was possible in the pastoral regions during short parts of the year but the
Mongols (unlike some of the Turks further west) did not take to farming.
Neither the pastoral nor the hunting-gathering economies could sustain
dense population settlements and as a result the region possessed no
cities. The Mongols lived in tents, gers, and travelled with their herds
from their winter to summer pasture lands.
Ethnic and language ties united the Mongol people but the scarce
resources meant that their society was divided into patrilineal lineages;
the richer families were larger, possessed more animals and pasture
lands. They therefore had many followers and were more influential in
local politics. Periodic natural calamities – either unusually harsh, cold
winters when game and stored provisions ran out or drought which
parched the grasslands – would force families to forage further afield
leading to conflict over pasture lands and predatory raids in search of
livestock. Groups of families would occasionally ally for offensive and
defensive purposes around richer and more powerful lineages but, barring
the few exceptions, these confederacies were usually small and short-
lived. The size of Genghis Khan’s confederation of Mongol and Turkish
tribes was perhaps matched in size only by that which had been stitched
together in the fifth century by Attila (d. 453).
Unlike Attila, however, Genghis Khan’s political system was far more
durable and survived its founder. It was stable enough to counter
larger armies with superior equipment in China, Iran and eastern
Europe. And, as they established control over these regions, the Mongols
administered complex agrarian economies and urban settlements –
sedentary societies – that were quite distant from their own social
experience and habitat.
Although the social and political organisations of the nomadic and
agrarian economies were very different, the two societies were hardly
foreign to each other. In fact, the scant resources of the steppe lands
drove Mongols and other Central Asian nomads to trade and barter
with their sedentary neighbours in China. This was mutually beneficial
to both parties: agricultural produce and iron utensils from China
were exchanged for horses, furs and game trapped in the steppe.
Commerce was not without its tensions, especially as the two groups
unhesitatingly applied military pressure to enhance profit. When the
Mongol lineages allied they could force their Chinese neighbours to
offer better terms and trade ties were sometimes discarded in favour of
outright plunder. This relationship would alter when the Mongols were
in disarray. The Chinese would then confidently assert their influence
in the steppe. These frontier wars were more debilitating to settled
societies. They dislocated agriculture and plundered cities. Nomads,
on the other hand, could retreat away from the zone of conflict with

marginal losses. Throughout its history, China suffered extensively
from nomad intrusion and different regimes – even as early as the
eighth century BCE – built fortifications to protect their subjects. Starting
from the third century BCE, these fortifications started to be integrated
into a common defensive outwork known today as the ‘Great Wall of
China’ a dramatic visual testament to the disturbance and fear
perpetrated by nomadic raids on the agrarian societies of north China.
The Career of Genghis Khan
Genghis Khan was born some time around 1162 near the Onon river
in the north of present-day Mongolia. Named Temujin, he was the son
of Yesugei, the chieftain of the Kiyat, a group of families related to the
Borjigid clan. His father was murdered at an early age and his mother,
Oelun-eke, raised Temujin, his brothers and step-brothers in great
hardship. The following decade was full of reversals – Temujin was
captured and enslaved and soon after his marriage, his wife, Borte,
was kidnapped, and he had to fight to recover her. During these years
of hardship he also managed to make important friends. The young
Boghurchu was his first ally and remained a trusted friend; Jamuqa,
his blood-brother (anda), was another. Temujin also restored old
alliances with the ruler of the Kereyits, Tughril/Ong Khan, his father’s
old blood-brother.
Through the 1180s and 1190s, Temujin remained an ally of Ong
Khan and used the alliance to defeat powerful adversaries like Jamuqa,
his old friend who had become a hostile foe. It was after defeating him

China.

that Temujin felt confident enough to move against other tribes: the
powerful Tatars (his father’s assassins), the Kereyits and Ong Khan
himself in 1203. The final defeat of the Naiman people and the powerful
Jamuqa in 1206, left Temujin as the dominant personality in the politics
of the steppe lands, a position that was recognised at an assembly of
Mongol chieftains (quriltai) where he was proclaimed the ‘Great Khan
of the Mongols’ (Qa’an) with the title Genghis Khan, the ‘Oceanic Khan’
or ‘Universal Ruler’.
Just before the quriltai of 1206, Genghis Khan had reorganised the
Mongol people into a more effective, disciplined military force (see following
sections) that facilitated the success of his future campaigns. The first of
his concerns was to conquer China, divided at this time into three realms:
the Hsi Hsia people of Tibetan origin in the north-western provinces; the
Jurchen whose Chin dynasty ruled north China from Peking; the Sung
dynasty who controlled south China. By 1209, the Hsi Hsia were defeated,
the ‘Great Wall of China’ was breached in 1213 and Peking sacked in
1215. Long drawn-out battles against the Chin continued until 1234 but
Genghis Khan was satisfied enough with the progress of his campaigns to
return to his Mongolian homeland in 1216 and leave the military affairs
of the region to his subordinates.
After the defeat in 1218 of the Qara Khita who controlled the Tien
Shan mountains north-west of China, Mongol dominions reached the
Amu Darya, and the states of Transoxiana and Khwarazm. Sultan
Muhammad, the ruler of Khwarazm, felt the fury of Genghis Khan’s
rage when he executed Mongol envoys. In the campaigns between
1219 and 1221 the great cities – Otrar, Bukhara, Samarqand, Balkh,
Gurganj, Merv, Nishapur and Herat – surrendered to the Mongol forces.
Towns that resisted were devastated. At Nishapur, where a Mongol
prince was killed during the siege operation, Genghis Khan commanded
that the ‘town should be laid waste in such a manner that the site
could be ploughed upon; and that in the exaction of vengeance [for the
death of the prince] not even cats and dogs should be left alive’.
Estimated Extent of Mongol Destruction
All reports of Genghis Khan’s campaigns agree at the vast number of people
killed following the capture of cities that defied his authority. The numbers
are staggering: at the capture of Nishapur in 1220, 1,747,000 people were
massacred while the toll at Herat in 1222 was 1,600,000 people and at
Baghdad in 1258, 800,000. Smaller towns suffered proportionately: Nasa,
70,000 dead; Baihaq district, 70,000; and at Tun in the Kuhistan province,
12,000 individuals were executed.
How did medieval chroniclers arrive at such figures?
Juwaini, the Persian chronicler of the Ilkhans stated that 1,300,000 people
were killed in Merv. He reached the figure because it took thirteen days to
count the dead and each day they counted 100,000 corpses.

Mongol forces in pursuit of Sultan Muhammad pushed into
Azerbaijan, defeated Russian forces at the Crimea and encircled the
Caspian Sea. Another wing followed the Sultan’s son, Jalaluddin, into
Afghanistan and the Sindh province. At the banks of the Indus, Genghis
Khan considered returning to Mongolia through North India and
Assam, but the heat, the natural habitat and the ill portents reported
by his Shaman soothsayer made him change his mind.
Genghis Khan died in 1227, having spent most of his life in military
combat. His military achievements were astounding and they were
largely a result of his ability to innovate and transform different
aspects of steppe combat into extremely effective military strategies.
The horse-riding skills of the Mongols and the Turks provided speed
and mobility to the army; their abilities as rapid-shooting archers
from horseback were further perfected during regular hunting
expeditions which doubled as field manoeuvres. The steppe cavalry
had always travelled light and moved quickly, but now it brought all
its knowledge of the terrain and the weather to do the unimaginable:
they carried out campaigns in the depths of winter, treating frozen
rivers as highways to enemy cities and camps. Nomads were
conventionally at a loss against fortified encampments but Genghis
Khan learnt the importance of siege engines and naphtha
bombardment very quickly. His engineers prepared light
portable equipment, which was used against opponents with
devastating effect.

The Mongols after Genghis Khan
We can divide Mongol expansion after Genghis Khan’s death into two
distinct phases: the first which spanned the years 1236-42 when the
major gains were in the Russian steppes, Bulghar, Kiev, Poland and
Hungary. The second phase including the years 1255-1300 led to the
conquest of all of China (1279), Iran, Iraq and Syria. The frontier of the
empire stabilised after these campaign.
The Mongol military forces met with few reversals in the decades
after 1203 but, quite noticeably, after the 1260s the original impetus of
campaigns could not be sustained in the West. Although Vienna, and
beyond it western Europe, as well as Egypt was within the grasp of
Mongol forces, their retreat from the Hungarian steppes and defeat at
the hands of the Egyptian forces signalled the emergence of new political
trends. There were two facets to this: the first was a consequence of the
internal politics of succession within the Mongol family where the
descendants of Jochi and Ogodei allied to control the office of the great
Khan in the first two generations. These interests were more important
than the pursuit of campaigns in Europe. The second compulsion
occurred as the Jochi and Ogodei lineages were marginalised by the
Toluyid branch of Genghis Khanid descendants. With the accession of
Mongke, a descendant of Toluy, Genghis Khan’s youngest son, military
campaigns were pursued energetically in Iran during the 1250s. But as
Toluyid interests in the conquest of China increased during the 1260s,
forces and supplies were increasingly diverted into the heartlands of the
Mongol dominion. As a result, the Mongols fielded a small, understaffed
force against the Egyptian military. Their defeat and the increasing
preoccupation with China of the Toluyid family marked the end of
western expansion of the Mongols. Concurrently, conflict between the
Jochid and Toluyid descendants along the Russian-Iranian frontier
diverted the Jochids away from further European campaigns.
The suspension of Mongol expansion in the West did not arrest
their campaigns in China which was reunited under the Mongols.
Paradoxically, it was at the moment of its greatest successes that
internal turbulence between members of the ruling family manifested
itself. The next section discusses the factors that led to some of the
greatest successes of the Mongol political enterprise but also inhibited
its progress.
Social, Political and Military Organisation
Among the Mongols, and many other nomadic societies as well, all the
able-bodied, adult males of the tribe bore arms: they constituted the
armed forces when the occasion demanded. The unification of the
different Mongol tribes and subsequent campaigns against diverse
people introduced new members into Genghis Khan’s army complicating
the composition of this relatively small, undifferentiated body into an

incredibly heterogeneous mass of people. It included groups like the
Turkic Uighurs, who had accepted his authority willingly. It also included
defeated people, like the Kereyits, who were accommodated in the
confederacy despite their earlier hostility.
Genghis Khan worked to systematically erase the old tribal identities
of the different groups who joined his confederacy. His army was
organised according to the old steppe system of decimal units: in divisions
of 10s, 100s, 1,000s and [notionally] 10,000 soldiers. In the old system
the clan and the tribe would have coexisted within the decimal units.
Genghis Khan stopped this practice. He divided the old tribal groupings
and distributed their members into new military units. Any individual
who tried to move from his/her allotted group without permission received
harsh punishment. The largest unit of soldiers, approximating 10,000
soldiers (tuman) now included fragmented groups of people from a variety
of different tribes and clans. This altered the old steppe social order
integrating different lineages and clans and providing them with a new
identity derived from its progenitor, Genghis Khan.
The new military contingents were required to serve under his four
sons and specially chosen captains of his army units called noyan.
Also important within the new realm were a band of followers who had
served Genghis Khan loyally through grave adversity for many years.
Genghis Khan publicly honoured some of these individuals as his ‘blood-
brothers’ (anda); yet others, freemen of a humbler rank, were given
special ranking as his bondsmen (naukar), a title that marked their
close relationship with their master. This ranking did not preserve the
rights of the old clan chieftains; the new aristocracy derived its status
from a close relationship with the Great Khan of the Mongols.
In this new hierarchy, Genghis Khan assigned the responsibility of
governing the newly-conquered people to his four sons. These comprised
the four ulus, a term that did not originally mean fixed territories. Genghis
Khan’s lifetime was still the age of rapid conquests and expanding domains,
where frontiers were still extremely fluid. For example, the eldest son,
Jochi, received the Russian steppes but the farthest extent of his territory,
ulus, was indeterminate: it extended as far west as his horses could roam.
The second son, Chaghatai, was given the Transoxanian steppe and lands
north of the Pamir mountains adjacent to those of his brother. Presumably,
these lands would shift as Jochi marched westward. Genghis Khan had
indicated that his third son, Ogodei, would succeed him as the Great
Khan and on accession the Prince established his capital at Karakorum.
The youngest son, Toluy, received the ancestral lands of Mongolia. Genghis
Khan envisaged that his sons would rule the empire collectively, and to
underline this point, military contingents (tama) of the individual princes
were placed in each ulus. The sense of a dominion shared by the members
of the family was underlined at the assembly of chieftains, quriltais, where
all decisions relating to the family or the state for the forthcoming season
– campaigns, distribution of plunder, pasture lands and succession –
were collectively taken.

The contradictions between the nomadic and sedentary elements
within the Mongol empire eased through the thirteenth century. In
the 1230s, for example, as the Mongols waged their successful war
against the Chin dynasty in north China, there was a strong pressure
group within the Mongol leadership that advocated the massacre of all
peasantry and the conversion of their fields into pasture lands. But by
the 1270s, when south China was annexed to the Mongol empire after
the defeat of the Sung dynasty, Genghis Khan’s grandson, Qubilai
Khan (d. 1294), appeared as the protector of the peasants and the
cities. In the 1290s, the Mongol ruler of Iran, Ghazan Khan (d. 1304),
a descendant of Genghis Khan’s youngest son Toluy, warned family
members and other generals to avoid pillaging the peasantry. It did
not lead to a stable prosperous realm, he advised in a speech whose
sedentary overtones would have made Genghis Khan shudder.

Ghazan Khan’s Speech
Ghazan Khan (1295-1304) was the first Il-Khanid ruler to convert
to Islam. He gave the following speech to the Mongol-Turkish nomad
commanders, a speech that was probably drafted by his Persian
wazir Rashiduddin and included in the minister’s letters:
‘I am not on the side of the Persian peasantry. If there is a purpose
in pillaging them all, there is no one with more power to do this
than I. Let us rob them together. But if you wish to be certain of
collecting grain and food for your tables in the future, I must be
harsh with you. You must be taught reason. If you insult the
peasantry, take their oxen and seed and trample their crops into
the ground, what will you do in the future? … The obedient
peasantry must be distinguished from the peasantry who are
rebels…’
From Genghis Khan’s reign itself, the Mongols had recruited civil
administrators from the conquered societies. They were sometimes moved
around: Chinese secretaries deployed in Iran and Persians in China. They
helped in integrating the distant dominions and their backgrounds and
training were always useful in blunting the harsher edges of nomadic
predation on sedentary life. The Mongol Khans trusted them as long as
they continued to raise revenue for their masters and these administrators
could sometimes command considerable influence. In the 1230s, the
Chinese minister Yeh-lu Ch’u-ts’ai, muted some of Ogedei’s more rapacious
instincts; the Juwaini family played a similar role in Iran through the
latter half of the thirteenth century and at the end of the century, the
wazir, Rashiduddin, drafted the speech that Ghazan Khan delivered to
his Mongol compatriots asking them to protect, not harass, the peasantry.
The pressure to sedentarise was greater in the new areas of Mongol
domicile, areas distant from the original steppe habitat of the nomads. By
the middle of the thirteenth century the sense of a common patrimony
shared by all the brothers was gradually replaced by individual dynasties
each ruling their separate ulus, a term which now carried the sense of a
territorial dominion. This was, in part, a result of succession struggles,
where Genghis Khanid descendants competed for the office of Great Khan
and prized pastoral lands. Descendants of Toluy had come to rule both
China and Iran where they had formed the Yuan and Il-Khanid dynasties.
Descendants of Jochi formed the Golden Horde and ruled the Russian
steppes; Chaghatai’s successors ruled the steppes of Transoxiana and
the lands called Turkistan today. Noticeably, nomadic traditions persisted
longest amongst the steppe dwellers in Central Asia (descendants of
Chaghatai) and Russia (the Golden Horde).
The gradual separation of the descendants of Genghis Khan into
separate lineage groups implied that their connections with the memory

and traditions of a past family concordance also altered. At an obvious
level this was the result of competition amongst the cousin clans and
here the Toluyid branch was more adept in presenting their version of
the family disagreements in the histories produced under their
patronage. To a large extent this was a consequence of their control of
China and Iran and the large number of literati that its family members
could recruit. At a more sophisticated level, the disengagement with
the past also meant underlining the merits of the regnant rulers as a
contrast to other past monarchs. This exercise in comparison did not
exclude Genghis Khan himself. Persian chronicles produced in Il-Khanid
Iran during the late thirteenth century detailed the gory killings of the
Great Khan and greatly exaggerated the numbers killed. For example,
in contrast to an eyewitness report that 400 soldiers defended the
citadel of Bukhara, an Il-Khanid chronicle reported that 30,000 soldiers
were killed in the attack on the citadel. Although Il-Khanid reports still
eulogised Genghis Khan, they also carried a statement of relief that
times had changed and the great killings of the past were over. The
Genghis Khanid legacy was important, but for his descendants to
appear as convincing heroes to a sedentary audience, they could no
longer appear in quite the same way as their ancestor.
Following the research of David Ayalon, recent work on the yasa,
the code of law that Genghis Khan was supposed to have promulgated
at the quriltai of 1206, has elaborated on the complex ways in which
the memory of the Great Khan was fashioned by his successors. In its
earliest formulation the term was written as yasaq which meant ‘law’,
‘decree’ or ‘order’. Indeed, the few details that we possess about the
yasaq concern administrative regulations: the organisation of the hunt,
the army and the postal system. By the middle of the thirteenth century,
however, the Mongols had started using the related term yasa in a
more general sense to mean the ‘legal code of Genghis Khan’.
We may be able to understand the changes in the meaning of the
term if we take a look at some of the other developments that occurred
at the same time. By the middle of the thirteenth century the Mongols
had emerged as a unified people and just created the largest empire
the world had ever seen. They ruled over very sophisticated urban
societies, with their respective histories, cultures and laws. Although
the Mongols dominated the region politically, they were a numerical
minority. The one way in which they could protect their identity and
distinctiveness was through a claim to a sacred law given to them by
their ancestor. The yasa was in all probability a compilation of the
customary traditions of the Mongol tribes but in referring to it as
Genghis Khan’s code of law, the Mongol people also laid claim to a
‘lawgiver’ like Moses and Solomon, whose authoritative code could be
imposed on their subjects. The yasa served to cohere the Mongol people
around a body of shared beliefs, it acknowledged their affinity to Genghis
Khan and his descendants and, even as they absorbed different aspects
of a sedentary lifestyle, gave them the confidence to retain their ethnic

identity and impose their ‘law’ upon their defeated subjects. It was an
extremely empowering ideology and although Genghis Khan may not
have planned such a legal code, it was certainly inspired by his vision
and was vital in the construction of a Mongol universal dominion.
In 1221, after the conquest of Bukhara, Genghis Khan had assembled
the rich Muslim residents at the festival ground and had
admonished them. He called them sinners and warned them to
compensate for their sins by parting with their hidden wealth. The
episode was dramatic enough to be painted and for a long time
afterwards people still remembered the incident. In the late sixteenth
century, ‘Abdullah Khan, a distant descendant of Jochi, Genghis
Khan’s eldest son, went to the same festival ground in Bukhara.
Unlike Genghis Khan, however, ‘Abdullah Khan went to perform
his holiday prayers there. His chronicler, Hafiz-i Tanish, reported
this performance of Muslim piety by his master and included the
surprising comment: ‘this was according to the yasa of Genghis
Khan’.
Conclusion: Situating Genghis Khan and the
Mongols in World History
When we remember Genghis Khan today the only images that appear
in our imagination are those of the conqueror, the destroyer of
cities, and an individual who was responsible for the death of
thousands of people. Many thirteenth-century residents of towns
in China, Iran and eastern Europe looked at the hordes from the
steppes with fear and distaste. And yet, for the Mongols, Genghis
Khan was the greatest leader of all time: he united the Mongol
people, freed them from interminable tribal wars and Chinese
exploitation, brought them prosperity, fashioned a grand
transcontinental empire and restored trade routes and markets that
attracted distant travellers like the Venetian Marco Polo. The
contrasting images are not simply a case of dissimilar perspectives;
they should make us pause and reflect on how one (dominant)
perspective can completely erase all others.
Beyond the opinions of the defeated sedentary people, consider
for a moment the sheer size of the Mongol dominion in the thirteenth
century and the diverse body of people and faiths that it embraced.

Hungary and was in the service of one of the prince’s wives who was a
Nestorian Christian. At the court he came across a Parisian goldsmith
named Guillaume Boucher, ‘whose brother dwelt on the Grand Pont in
Paris’. This man was first employed by the Queen Sorghaqtani and
then by Mongke’s younger brother. Rubruck found that at the great
court festivals the Nestorian priests were admitted first, with their
regalia, to bless the Grand Khan’s cup, and were followed by the Muslim
clergy and Buddhist and Taoist monks…

Changing Traditions
E have seen how, by the ninth century, large parts
of Asia and America witnessed the growth and
expansion of great empires – some nomadic, some based on
well-developed cities and trading networks that centred on them. The
difference between the Macedonian, Roman and Arab empires and
the ones that preceded them (the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chinese,
Mauryan) was that they covered greater areas of territory, and were
continental or trans-continental in nature. The Mongol empire was
similar.
Different cultural encounters were crucial to what took place. The
arrival of empires was almost always sudden, but they were almost
always the result of changes that had been taking place over a long
time in the core of what would become an empire.
Traditions in world history could change in different ways. In western
Europe during the period from the ninth to the seventeenth century,
much that we connect with modern times evolved slowly – the
development of scientific knowledge based on experiment rather than
religious belief, serious thought about the organisation of government,
with attention to the creation of civil services, parliaments and different
codes of law, improvements in technology that was used in industry
and agriculture. The consequences of these changes could be felt with
great force outside Europe.
As we have seen, by the fifth century CE, the Roman Empire in the
west had disintegrated. In western and central Europe, the remains of
the Roman Empire were slowly adapted to the administrative
requirements and needs of tribes that had established kingdoms there.
However, urban centres were smaller in western Europe than further
east.
By the ninth century, the commercial and urban centres, Aix,
London, Rome, Sienna – though small, could not be dismissed.  From
the ninth to the eleventh centuries, there were major developments in
the countryside in western Europe. The Church and royal government
developed a combination of Roman institutions with the customary

rules of tribes.  The finest example was the empire of Charlemagne in
western and central Europe at the beginning of the ninth century.
Even after its rapid collapse, urban centres and trading networks
persisted, albeit under heavy attack from Hungarians, Vikings and
others.
What happened was called ‘feudalism’. Feudalism was marked by
agricultural production around castles and ‘manor houses’, where
lords of the manor possessed land that was cultivated by peasants
(serfs) who pledged them loyalty, goods and services. These lords in
turn pledged their loyalty to greater lords who were ‘vassals’ of kings.
The Catholic Church (centred on the papacy) supported this state of
affairs and itself possessed land. In a world where uncertainties of life,
poor sense of medicine and low life expectancy were common, the
Church showed people how to behave so that life after death at least
would be tolerable. Monasteries were created where God-fearing people
could devote themselves to the service of God in the way Catholic
churchmen thought fit. Equally, churches were part of a network of
scholarship that ran from the Muslim states of Spain to Byzantium,
and they provided the petty kings of Europe with a sense of the opulence
of the eastern Mediterranean and beyond.
The influence of commerce and towns in the feudal order came to
evolve and change encouraged by Mediterranean entrepreneurs in
Venice and Genoa (from the twelfth century). Their ships carried on a
growing trade with Muslim states and the remains of the Roman Empire
in the east. Attracted by the lure of wealth in these areas, and inspired
by the idea of freeing ‘holy places’ associated with Christ from Muslims,
European kings reinforced links across the Mediterranean during the
‘crusades’.  Trade within Europe improved (centred on fairs and the
port cities of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and stimulated by a
growing population).

Opportunities for commercial expansion coincided with changing
attitudes concerning the value of life. Respect for human beings and
living things that marked much of Islamic art and literature, and the
example of Greek art and ideas that came to Europe from Byzantine
trade encouraged Europeans to take a new look at the world. And
from the fourteenth century (in what is called the ‘Renaissance’),
especially in north Italian towns, the wealthy became less concerned
with life after death and more with the wonders of life itself. Sculptors,
painters and writers became interested in humanity and the discovery
of the world.
By the end of the fifteenth century, this state of affairs encouraged
travel and discovery as never before. Voyages of discovery took place.
Spaniards and Portuguese, who had traded with northern Africa,
pushed further down the coast of western Africa, finally leading to
journeys around the Cape of Good Hope to India – which had a great
reputation in Europe as a source of spices that were in great demand.
Columbus attempted to find a western route to India and in 1492
reached the islands which the Europeans called the West Indies. Other
explorers tried to find a northern route to India and China via the
Arctic.
European travellers encountered a range of different peoples in the
course of their journeys. In part, they were interested in learning from
them. The papacy encouraged the work of the North African geographer
and traveller Hasan al-Wazzan (later known in Europe as Leo Africanus),
who wrote the first geography of Africa in the early sixteenth century
for Pope Leo X. Jesuit churchmen observed and wrote on Japan in the
sixteenth century. An Englishman Will Adams became a friend and

counsellor of the Japanese Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, in the early
seventeenth century. As in the case of Hasan al-Wazzan, peoples that
the Europeans encountered in the Americas often took a great interest
in them and sometimes worked for them. For example an Aztec woman
– later known as Dona Marina –  befriended the Spanish conqueror of
Mexico, Cortes, and interpreted and negotiated for him.
In their encounters, Europeans were sometimes cautious, self-
effacing and observant, even as they frequently attempted to establish
trade monopolies and enforce their authority by force of arms as the
Portuguese attempted to do in the Indian Ocean after Vasco da Gama’s
arrival in Calicut (present-day Kozhikode) in 1498. In other cases,
they were overbearing, aggressive and cruel and adopted an attitude
of superiority to those they met, considering such people ignorant.
The Catholic Church encouraged both attitudes. The Church was the
centre for the study of other cultures and languages,  but encouraged
attacks on people it saw as ‘un-Christian’.
From the point of view of non-Europeans, the encounter with Europe
varied. For much of the Islamic lands and India and China, though,
Europeans remained a curiosity until the end of the seventeenth
century. They were perceived as hardy traders and seamen who had
little to contribute to their sense of the larger world. The Japanese
learnt some of the advantages of European technology quickly – for
instance, they had begun large-scale production of muskets by the
late sixteenth century. In the Americas, enemies of the Aztec empire
sometimes used Europeans to challenge the power of the Aztecs. At
the same time the diseases the Europeans brought devastated the
populations, leading to the death of over 90 per cent of the people in
some areas by the end of the sixteenth century.

developments. This timeline draws attention to contects between
the continents, stimulated in many instances by the growth of
trade. The impact of these contacts was varied – while ideas,
inventions and goods were shared across continents, there was
also constant warfare between kingdoms to control land, resources
and access to trade routes. As a result men and women were often
displaced and enslaved, if not exterminated. In many ways, the

132  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
THE THREE ORDERS
IN this chapter, we shall learn about the socio-economic
and political changes which occurred in western Europe
between the ninth and sixteenth centuries. After the fall of
the Roman Empire, many groups of Germanic people from
eastern and central Europe occupied regions of Italy, Spain
and France.
In the absence of any unifying political force, military
conflict was frequent, and the need to gather resources to
protect one’s land became very important. Social
organisation was therefore centred on the control of land.
Its features were derived from both imperial Roman
traditions and German customs. Christianity, the official
religion of the Roman Empire from the fourth century,
survived the collapse of Rome, and gradually spread to
central and northern Europe. The Church also became a
major landholder and political power in Europe.
The ‘three orders’, the focus of this chapter, are three
social categories: Christian priests, landowning nobles and
peasants. The changing relationships between these three
groups was an important factor in shaping European
history for several centuries.
Over the last 100  years, European historians have done
detailed work on the histories of regions, even of individual
villages. This was possible because, from the medieval period,
there is a lot of material in the form of documents, details of
landownership, prices and legal cases: for example, churches
kept records of births, marriages and deaths, which have
made it possible to understand the structure of families and
of population. The inscriptions in churches give information
about traders’ associations, and songs and stories give a
sense of festivals and community activities.
All these can be used by historians to understand
economic and social life, and changes over a long period
(like increase in population) or over a short period (like
peasant revolts).
Of the many scholars in France who have worked on
feudalism, one of the earliest was Bloch. Marc Bloch
(1886–1944) was one of a group of scholars who argued
that history consisted of much more than just political history,
international relations and the lives of great people. He
emphasised the importance of geography in shaping human

An Introduction to Feudalism
The term ‘feudalism’ has been used by historians to describe the
economic, legal, political and social relationships that existed in Europe
in the medieval era. Derived from the German word ‘feud’, which

means ‘a piece of land’, it refers to the kind of society that developed
in medieval France, and later in England and in southern Italy.
In an economic sense, feudalism refers to a kind of agricultural
production which is based on the relationship between lords and
peasants. The latter cultivated their own land as well as that of the
lord. The peasants performed labour services for the lords, who in
exchange provided military protection. They also had extensive  judicial
control over peasants. Thus, feudalism went beyond the economic to
cover the social and political aspects of life as well.
Although its roots have been traced to practices that existed in
the Roman Empire and during the age of the French king
Charlemagne (742-814), feudalism as an established way of life in
large parts of Europe may be said to have emerged later, in the
eleventh century.
France and England
Gaul, a province of the Roman Empire, had two extensive coastlines,
mountain ranges, long rivers, forests and large tracts of plains suited
to agriculture.
The Franks, a Germanic tribe, gave their name to Gaul, making it
‘France’. From the sixth century, this region was a kingdom ruled by
Frankish/French kings, who were Christian. The French had very
strong links with the Church, which were further strengthened when
in 800 the Pope gave King Charlemagne the title of ‘Holy Roman
Emperor’, to ensure his support*.
Across a narrow channel lay the island of England–Scotland, which
in the eleventh century was conquered by a duke from the French
province of Normandy.

The Three Orders
French priests believed in the concept that people were members of one
of the three ‘orders’, depending on their work. A bishop stated, ‘Here
below, some pray, others fight, still others work...’ Thus, the three orders
of society were broadly the clergy, the nobility and the peasantry.
In the twelfth century, Abbess Hildegard of Bingen wrote: ‘Who would
think of herding his entire cattle in one stable – cows, donkeys,
sheep, goats, without difference? Therefore it is necessary to establish
difference among human beings, so that they do not destroy each
other … God makes distinctions among his flock, in heaven as on
earth. All are loved by him, yet there is no equality among them.’
The Second Order: The Nobility
Priests placed themselves in the first order, and nobles in the second.
The nobility had, in reality, a central role in social processes. This is
because they controlled land. This control was the outcome of a practice
called ‘vassalage’.
The kings of France were linked to the people by ‘vassalage’, similar
to the practice among the Germanic peoples, of whom the Franks
were one. The big landowners – the nobles – were vassals of the king,
and peasants were vassals of the landowners. A nobleman accepted
the king as his seigneur (senior) and they made a mutual promise: the
seigneur/lord (‘lord’ was derived from a word meaning one who provided
bread) would protect the vassal, who would be
loyal to him. This relationship involved elaborate
rituals and exchange of vows taken on the Bible
in a church. At this ceremony, the vassal received
a written charter or a staff or even a clod of
earth as a symbol of the land that was being
given to him by his master.
The noble enjoyed a privileged status.
He had absolute control over his property, in
perpetuity. He could raise troops called ‘feudal
levies’. The lord held his own courts of justice
and could even coin his own money.
He was the lord of all the people settled on
his land. He owned vast tracts of land which
contained his own dwellings, his private fields
and pastures and the homes and fields of his
tenant-peasants. His house was called a manor.
His private lands were cultivated by peasants,
who were also expected to act as foot-soldiers in
battle when required, in addition to working on
their own farms.
‘Abbey’ is derived
from the Syriac
abba, meaning
father. An abbey
was governed by
an abbot or an
abbess.

The Manorial Estate
A lord had his own manor-house. He also controlled villages – some
lords controlled hundreds of villages – where peasants lived. A small
manorial estate could contain a dozen families, while larger estates
might include fifty or sixty. Almost everything needed for daily life was
found on the estate: grain was grown in the fields, blacksmiths and
carpenters maintained the lord’s implements and repaired his weapons,
while stonemasons looked after his buildings. Women spun and wove
fabric, and children worked in the lord’s wine-presses. The estate had
extensive woodlands and forests where the lords hunted. They contained

pastures where his cattle and his horses grazed. There was a church
on the estate and a castle for defence.
From the thirteenth century, some castles were made bigger for
use as a residence for a knight’s family. In fact, in England castles
were practically unknown before the Norman Conquest, and
developed as centres of political administration and military power
under the feudal system.
The manor could not be completely self-sufficient because salt,
millstones and metalware had to be obtained from outside sources.
Those lords who wanted a luxurious lifestyle and were keen to buy rich
furnishings, musical instruments and ornaments not locally produced,
had to get these from other places.
The Knights
From the ninth century, there were frequent localised wars in Europe.
The amateur peasant-soldiers were not sufficient, and good cavalry
was needed. This led to the growing importance of a new section of
people – the knights. They were linked to the lords, just as the latter
were linked to the king. The lord gave the knight a piece of land (called
‘fief’) and promised to protect it. The fief could be inherited. It extended
to anything between 1,000 and 2,000 acres or more, including a house
for the knight and his family, a church and other establishments to
house his dependants, besides a watermill and a wine-press. As in the
feudal manor, the land of the fief was cultivated by peasants. In exchange,
the knight paid his lord a regular fee and promised to fight for him in
war. To keep up their skills, knights spent time each day fencing and
practising tactics with dummies. A knight might serve more than one
lord, but his foremost loyalty was to his own lord.
In France, from the twelfth century, minstrels travelled from manor
to manor, singing songs which told stories – partly historical, partly
invented – about brave kings and knights. In an age when not too
many people could read and manuscripts were few, these travelling
bards were very popular. Many manors had a narrow balcony above
the large hall where the people of the manor gathered for meals. This
was the minstrels’ gallery, from where singers entertained nobles while
they feasted.
The First Order: The Clergy
The Catholic Church had its own laws, owned lands given to it by
rulers, and could levy taxes. It was thus a very powerful institution
which did not depend on the king. At the head of the western Church
was the Pope. He lived in Rome. The Christians in Europe were guided
by bishops and clerics – who constituted the first ‘order’. Most villages
had their own church, where people assembled every Sunday to listen
to the sermon by the priest and to pray together.
‘If my dear lord
is slain, his fate
I’ll share,
If he is hanged,
then hang me
by his side.
If to the stake he
goes, with him
I’ll burn;
And if he’s

with him.’

Everyone could not become a priest. Serfs were banned, as were
the physically challenged. Women could not become priests. Men
who became priests could not marry. Bishops were the religious
nobility. Like lords who owned vast landed estates, the bishops also
had the use of vast estates, and lived in grand palaces. The Church
was entitled to a tenth share of whatever the peasants produced
from their land over the course of the year, called a ‘tithe’.  Money
also came in the form of endowments made by the rich for their
own welfare and the welfare of their deceased relatives in the afterlife.
Some of the important ceremonies conducted by the Church
copied formal customs of the feudal elite. The act of kneeling while
praying, with hands clasped and head bowed, was an exact replica
of the way in which a knight conducted himself while taking vows of
loyalty to his lord. Similarly, the use of the term ‘lord’ for God was
another example of feudal culture that found its way into the
practices of the Church. Thus, the religious and the lay worlds of
feudalism shared many  customs and symbols.
Monks
Apart from the Church, devout Christians had another kind of
organisation. Some deeply religious people chose to live isolated
lives, in contrast to clerics who lived amongst people in towns and
villages. They lived in religious communities called abbeys or
monasteries, often in places very far from human habitation. Two
of the more well-known monasteries were those established by St
Benedict in Italy in 529 and of Cluny in Burgundy in 910.
Monks took vows to remain in the abbey for the rest of their lives
and to spend their time in prayer, study and manual labour, like
farming. Unlike priesthood, this life was open to both men and
women – men became monks and women nuns. Except in a few
cases, all abbeys were single-sex communities, that is, there were
separate abbeys for men and women. Like priests, monks and nuns
did not marry.
From small communities of 10 or 20 men/women, monasteries
grew to communities often of several hundred, with large buildings
and landed estates, with attached schools or colleges and hospitals.
They contributed to the development of the arts. Abbess Hildegard
(see p.135) was a gifted musician, and did much to develop the
practice of community singing of prayers in church. From the
thirteenth century, some groups of monks – called friars – chose
not to be based in a monastery but to move from place to place,
preaching to the people and living on charity.

140  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
By the fourteenth century, there was a growing uncertainty about
the value and purpose of monasticism. In England, Langland’s poem,
Piers Plowman (c.1360-70), contrasted the ease and luxury of the lives
of some monks with the ‘pure faith’ of ‘simple ploughmen and shepherds
and poor common labourers.’ Also in England, Chaucer wrote the
Canterbury Tales (see quotation below) which had comic portraits of a
nun, a monk and a friar.
The Church and Society
Though Europeans became Christian, they still held on to some of
their old beliefs in magic and folk traditions. Christmas and Easter
became important dates from the fourth century. Christ’s birth,
celebrated on 25 December, replaced an old pre-Roman festival, the
date of which was calculated by the solar calendar. Easter marked
the crucifixion of Christ and his rising from the dead. But its date
was not a fixed one, because it replaced an older festival to celebrate
the coming of spring after a long winter, dated by the lunar calendar.
Traditionally, on that day, people of each village used to make a
tour of their village lands. With the coming of Christianity, they
continued to do this, but they called the village the ‘parish’ (the area
under the supervision of one priest). Overworked peasants welcomed
‘holy days’/holidays because they were not expected to work then.
These days were meant for prayer, but people usually spent a good
part of them having fun and feasting.
Pilgrimage was an important part of a Christian’s life, and many
people went on long journeys to shrines of martyrs or to big churches.
‘When in April the sweet showers fall
And pierce the drought of March to the root
And the small birds are making melody
That sleep away the night with open eye…
(So Nature pricks them and their heart engages);
Then people long to go on pilgrimages,
And palmers* long to seek the foreign shrines
Of far-off saints, revered in various lands.
And especially from every shire
Of England, to Canterbury they make their journey.’

Middle English, and the verse is a translation in modern English.

The Third Order: Peasants, Free and Unfree
Let us now turn to the vast majority of people, namely, those who
sustained the first two orders. Cultivators were of two kinds: free
peasants and serfs (from the verb ‘to serve’).
Free peasants held their farms as tenants
of the lord. The men had to render military
service (at least forty days every year).
Peasant families had to set aside certain days
of the week, usually three but often more,
when they would go to the lord’s estate and
work there. The output from such labour,
called labour-rent, would go directly to the
lord. In addition, they could be required to
do other unpaid labour services, like digging
ditches, gathering firewood, building fences
and repairing roads and buildings. Besides
helping in the fields, women and children
had to do other tasks. They spun thread,
wove cloth, made candles and pressed
grapes to prepare wine for the lord’s use.
There was one direct tax called ‘taille’ that
kings sometimes imposed on peasants (the
clergy and nobles were exempted from
paying this).
Serfs cultivated plots of land, but these
belonged to the lord. Much of the produce
from this had to be given to the lord. They
also had to work on the land which
belonged exclusively to the lord. They
received no wages and could not leave the
estate without the lord’s permission. The lord claimed a number of
monopolies at the expense of his serfs. Serfs could use only their lord’s
mill to grind their flour, his oven to bake their bread, and his wine-
presses to distil wine and beer. The lord could decide whom a serf
should marry, or might give his blessing to the serf’s choice, but on
payment of a fee.
England
Feudalism developed in England from the eleventh century.
The Angles and Saxons, from central Europe, had settled in England in
the sixth century. The country’s name, England, is a variant of ‘Angle-
land’. In the eleventh century, William, the Duke of Normandy*, crossed
the English Channel with an army and defeated the Saxon king of England.
From this time, France and England were often at war because of disputes
over territory and trade.

William I had the land mapped, and distributed
it in sections to 180 Norman nobles who had
migrated with him. The lords became the chief
tenants of the king, and were expected to give him
military help. They were obliged to supply a certain
number of knights to the king. They soon began to
gift some of their own lands to knights who would
serve them just as they in turn served the king.
They could not, however, use their knights for private
warfare, which was forbidden in England. Anglo-
Saxon peasants became tenants of various levels of
landholders.
Factors Affecting Social and Economic Relations
While members of the first two orders saw the social system as stable
and unchanging, there were several processes which were transforming
the system. Some of these, such as changes in the environment, were
gradual and almost imperceptible. Others were more dramatic, like
the changes in agricultural technology and land use. These in turn
were shaped by and had an effect on the social and economic ties
between lords and vassals. Let us examine these processes one by one.
The Environment
From the fifth to the tenth centuries, most of Europe was covered with
vast forests. Thus the land available for agriculture was limited. Also,
peasants dissatisfied with their conditions could flee from oppression
and take refuge in the forest. Europe was undergoing an intensely
cold climatic spell in this period. This led to severe and prolonged
winters, a shortened growing season for crops, and reduced yields
from agriculture.
From the eleventh century, Europe entered a warm phase. Average
temperatures increased, which had a profound effect on agriculture.
Peasants now had a longer growing season and the soil, now less
subjected to frost, could be more easily ploughed. Environmental
historians have noted that there was a significant receding of the forest
line in many parts of Europe. This made expansion of the area under
cultivation possible.
Land Use
Initially, agricultural technology was very primitive. The only
mechanical aid available to the peasant was the wooden plough, drawn
by a team of oxen. This plough could at best scratch the surface of the
earth and was unable to fully draw out the natural productivity of the
soil. Agriculture was therefore very labour intensive. Fields had to be

dug by hand, often once in four years, and enormous manual labour
was required.
Also, an ineffective method of crop rotation was in use. The land
was divided in half, one field was planted in autumn with winter wheat,
while the other field was left fallow. Rye was planted on this piece of
fallow land the next year while the other half was put to fallow. With
this system, the soil slowly deteriorated, and famines were not
uncommon. Chronic malnutrition alternated with devastating famines
and life was difficult for the poor.
Despite these hardships, the lords were anxious to maximise their
incomes. Since it was not possible to increase output from the land,
the peasants were forced to bring under cultivation all the land in the
manorial estate, and spend more time doing this than they were legally
bound to do. The peasants did not bow quietly to oppression. Since
they could not protest openly, they resorted to passive resistance.
They spent more time cultivating their own fields, and kept much of
the product of that labour for themselves. They also avoided performing
unpaid extra services. They came into conflict with the lords over pasture
and forest lands, and saw these lands as resources to be used by the
whole community, while the lords treated these as their private property.
New Agricultural Technology
By the eleventh century, there is evidence of several technological changes.
Instead of the basic wooden ploughs, cultivators began using heavy
iron-tipped ploughs and mould-boards. These ploughs could dig much
deeper and the mould-boards turned the topsoil properly. With this
the nutrients from the soil were better utilised.
The methods of harnessing animals to the plough improved. Instead
of the neck-harness, the shoulder-harness came into use. This enabled
animals to exert greater power. Horses were now better shod, with iron
horseshoes, which prevented foot decay. There was increased use of
wind and water energy for agriculture. More water-powered and wind-
powered mills were set up all over Europe for purposes like milling
corn and pressing grapes.
There were also changes in land use. The most revolutionary one
was the switch from a two-field to a three-field system. In this, peasants
could use a field two years out of three if they planted it with one crop
in autumn and a different crop in spring a year and a half later. That
meant that farmers could break their holdings into three fields. They
could plant one with wheat or rye in autumn for human consumption.
The second could be used in spring to raise peas, beans and lentils for
human use, and oats and barley for the horses. The third field lay
fallow. Each year they rotated the use among the three fields.
With these improvements, there was an almost immediate increase
in the amount of food produced from each unit of land. Food availability

doubled. The greater use of plants like peas and beans meant more
vegetable proteins in the diet of the average European and a better
source of fodder for their animals. For cultivators, it meant better
opportunities. They could now produce more food from less land. The
average size of a peasant’s farm shrank from about 100 acres to 20 to
30 acres by the thirteenth century. Holdings which were smaller could
be more efficiently cultivated and reduced the amount of labour needed.
This gave the peasants time for other activities.
Some of these technological changes cost a lot of money.
Peasants did not have enough money to set up watermills and
windmills. Therefore the initiative was taken by the lords. But peasants
were able to take the initiative in many things, such as extending
arable land. They also switched to the three-field rotation of crops, and
set up small forges and smithies in the villages, where iron-tipped
ploughs and horseshoes were made and repaired cheaply.
From the eleventh century, the personal bonds that had been the
basis of feudalism were weakening, because economic transactions
were becoming more and more money based. Lords found it convenient
to ask for rent in cash, not services, and cultivators were selling their
crops for money (instead of exchanging them for other goods) to traders,
who would then take such goods to be sold in the towns. The increasing
use of money began to influence prices, which became higher in times
of poor harvests. In England, for instance, agricultural prices doubled
between the 1270s and the 1320s.
A Fourth Order? New Towns and Townspeople
Expansion in agriculture was accompanied by growth in three related
areas: population, trade and towns. From roughly 42 million in 1000,
Europe’s population stood at 62 million around 1200 and 73 million in
1300. Better food meant a longer lifespan. By the thirteenth century, an
average European could expect to live 10 years longer than in the eighth
century. Women and girls had shorter lifespans compared to men because
the latter ate better food.
The towns of the Roman Empire had become deserted and ruined
after its fall. But from the eleventh century, as agriculture increased
and became able to sustain higher levels of population, towns began
to grow again. Peasants who had surplus grain to sell needed a place
where they could set up a selling centre and where they could buy
tools and cloth. This led to the growth of periodic fairs and small
marketing centres which gradually developed town-like features – a
town square, a church, roads where merchants built shops and
homes, an office where those who governed the town could meet. In
other places, towns grew around large castles, bishops’ estates, or
large churches.
In towns, instead of services, people paid a tax to the lords who
owned the land on which the town stood. Towns offered the prospect
© NCERT

of paid work and freedom from the lord’s control, for young people
from peasant families.
‘Town air makes free’ was a popular saying. Many serfs craving to
be free ran away and hid in towns. If a serf could stay for one year and
one day without his lord discovering him, he would become a free
man. Many people in towns were free peasants or escaped serfs who
provided unskilled labour. Shopkeepers and merchants were numerous.
Later there was need for individuals with specialised skills, like bankers
and lawyers. The bigger towns had populations of about 30,000. They
could be said to have formed a ‘fourth’ order.
The basis of economic organisation was the guild. Each craft or
industry was organised into a guild, an association which controlled
the quality of the product, its price and its sale. The ‘guild-hall’ was a
feature of every town; it was a building for ceremonial functions, and
where the heads of all the guilds met formally. Guards patrolled the
town walls and musicians were called to play at feasts and in civic
processions, and innkeepers looked after travellers.
By the eleventh century, new trade routes with West Asia were
developing (see Theme 5). Scandinavian merchants were sailing south
from the North Sea to exchange furs and hunting-hawks for cloth;
English traders came to sell tin. In France, by the twelfth century,
commerce and crafts began to grow. Earlier, craftsmen used to travel
from manor to manor; now they found it easier to settle in one place
where goods could be produced and traded for food. As the number of
towns grew and trade continued to expand, town merchants became
rich and powerful, and rivalled the power of the nobility.

Cathedral-towns
One of the ways that rich merchants spent their money was by making
donations to churches. From the twelfth century, large churches –
called cathedrals – were being built in France. These belonged to
monasteries, but different groups of people contributed to their
construction with their own labour, materials or money. Cathedrals
were built of stone, and took many years to complete. As they were
being built, the area around the cathedrals became more populated,
and when they were completed they became centres of pilgrimage.
Thus, small towns developed around them.
Cathedrals were designed so that the priest’s voice could be heard
clearly within the hall where large numbers of people gathered, and so
that the singing by monks could sound beautiful and the chiming
bells calling people to prayer could be heard
over a great distance. Stained glass was
used for windows. During the day the
sunlight would make them radiant for
people inside the cathedral, and after
sunset the light of candles would make
them visible to people outside. The stained
glass windows narrated the stories in the
Bible through pictures, which illiterate
people could ‘read’.

storehouse of the brethren, and who would never neglect their duty,
to look after these [works of art].’
– Abbot Suger (1081-1151) about the Abbey of St Denis, near Paris.
The Crisis of the Fourteenth Century
By the early fourteenth century, Europe’s economic expansion slowed
down. This was due to three factors.
In northern Europe, by the end of the thirteenth century the warm
summers of the previous 300 years had given way to bitterly cold
summers. Seasons for growing crops were reduced by a month and it
became difficult to grow crops on higher ground. Storms and oceanic
flooding destroyed many farmsteads, which resulted in less income in
taxes for governments. The opportunities offered by favourable climatic
conditions before the thirteenth century had led to large-scale reclamation
of the land of forests and pastures for agriculture. But intensive ploughing
had exhausted the soil despite the practice of the three-field rotation of
crops, because clearance was not accompanied by proper soil
conservation. The shortage of pasturage reduced the number of cattle.
Population growth was outstripping resources, and the immediate result
was famine. Severe famines hit Europe between 1315 and 1317, followed
in the 1320s by massive cattle deaths.
In addition, trade was hit by a severe shortage of metal money
because of a shortfall in the output of silver mines in Austria and
Serbia. This forced governments to reduce the silver content of the
currency, and to mix it with cheaper metals.
The worst was yet to come. As trade expanded in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries, ships carrying goods from distant countries had
started arriving in European ports. Along with the ships came rats –
carrying the deadly bubonic plague infection (the ‘Black Death’). Western
Europe, relatively isolated in earlier centuries, was hit by the epidemic
between 1347 and 1350. The modern estimate of mortality in that
epidemic is that 20 per cent of the people of the whole of Europe died,
with some places losing as much as 40 per cent of the population.

As trade centres, cities were the hardest hit. In enclosed communities
like monasteries and convents, when one individual contracted the
plague, it was not long before everyone did. And in almost every case,
none survived. The plague took its worst toll among infants, the young

the 1360s and 1370s. The population of Europe, 73 million in 1300,
stood reduced to 45 million in 1400.
This catastrophe, combined with the economic crisis, caused
immense social dislocation. Depopulation resulted in a major shortage
of labour. Serious imbalances were created between agriculture and
manufacture, because there were not enough people to engage in both
equally. Prices of agricultural goods dropped as there were fewer people
to buy. Wage rates increased because the demand for labour, particularly
agricultural labour, rose in England by as much as 250 per cent in the
aftermath of the Black Death. The surviving labour force could now
demand twice their earlier wages.
Social Unrest
The income of lords was thus badly hit. It declined as agricultural prices
came down and wages of labourers increased. In desperation, they tried
to give up the money-contracts they had entered into and revive labour-
services. This was violently opposed by peasants, particularly the better-
educated and more prosperous ones. In 1323, peasants revolted in
Flanders, in 1358 in France, and in 1381 in England.
Though these rebellions were ruthlessly crushed, it is significant that
they occurred with the most violent intensity in those areas which had
experienced the prosperity of the economic expansion – a sign that
peasants were attempting to protect the gains they had made in previous
centuries. Despite the severe repression, the sheer intensity of peasant
opposition ensured that the old feudal relations could not be reimposed.
The money economy was too far advanced to be reversed. Therefore,
though the lords succeeded in crushing the revolts, the peasants ensured
that the feudal privileges of earlier days could not be reinvented.

Political Changes
Developments in the political sphere paralleled social processes. In the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, European kings strengthened their
military and financial power. The powerful new states they created
were as significant for Europe as the economic changes that were
occurring. Historians have therefore called these kings ‘the new
monarchs’. Louis XI in France, Maximilian in Austria, Henry VII in
England and Isabelle and Ferdinand in Spain were absolutist rulers,
who  started the process of
organising standing armies, a
permanent bureaucracy and
national taxation and, in Spain and
Portugal, began to play a role in
Europe’s expansion overseas (see
Theme 8).
The most important reason for the
triumph of these monarchies was
the social changes which had taken
place in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. The dissolution of the
feudal system of lordship and
vassalage, and the slow rate of
economic growth had given the first
opportunity to kings to increase
their control over their powerful and
not-so-powerful subjects. Rulers
dispensed with the system of feudal
levies for their armies and
introduced professionally trained
infantry equipped with guns and
siege artillery (see Theme 5) directly
under their control. The resistance
of the aristocracies crumbled in the
face of the firepower of the kings.

The New Monarchy

1474–1556    New monarchs in Spain
1485–1547    New monarchs in England
By increasing taxes, monarchs got enough revenues to support larger
armies and thus defended and expanded their frontiers and overcame
internal resistance to royal authority. Centralisation, however, did not
occur without resistance from the aristocracy. A common thread running
through all types of opposition to the monarchies was the question of
taxation. In England, rebellions occurred and were put down in 1497,
1536, 1547, 1549 and 1553. In France, Louis XI (1461-83) had to wage
a long struggle against dukes and princes. Lesser nobles, often members
of local assemblies, resisted this royal usurpation of their powers. The
‘religious’ wars in France in the sixteenth century were in part a contest
between royal privileges and regional liberties.
The nobility managed a tactical shift in order to ensure their survival.
From being opponents to the new regimes, they quickly transformed
themselves into loyalists. It is for this reason that royal absolutism has
been called a modified form of feudalism.
Precisely the same class of people who had been
rulers in the feudal system – the lords –
continued to dominate the political scene. They
were given permanent positions in the
administrative service. But the new regimes
were different in some important ways.
The king was no longer at the apex of a
pyramid where loyalty had been a matter of
personal dependence and trust. He was now at
the centre of an elaborate courtier society and
a network of patron–client relationships. All
monarchies, weak or powerful, needed the
cooperation of those who could command authority. Patronage became
the means of ensuring such cooperation. And patronage could be given
or obtained by means of money. Therefore money became an important
way in which non-aristocratic elements like merchants and bankers
could gain access to the court. They lent money to the kings, who used
it to pay the wages of soldiers. Rulers thus made space for non-feudal
elements in the state system.
The later history of France and England was to be shaped by these
changes in the power structures. In the reign of the child-king Louis
XIII of France, in 1614, a meeting was held of the French consultative
assembly, known as the Estates-General (with three houses to represent
the three estates/orders – clergy, nobility, and the rest). After this, it

was not summoned again for nearly two centuries, till 1789, because
the kings did not want to share power with the three orders.
What happened in England was very different. Even before the
Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxons had a Great Council, which the
king had to consult before imposing any tax. This developed into what
was called the Parliament, which consisted of the House of Lords, the
members of which were the lords and the clergy, and the House of
Commons, representing towns and rural areas. King Charles I ruled
for 11 years (1629–40) without calling Parliament. When he was forced
to call it, because he needed money, a section of Parliament decided to
go to war against him, and later executed him and established a republic.
This did not last long, and monarchy was restored, but on the condition
that Parliament would be called regularly.
Today, France has a republican form of government and England
has a monarchy. This is because of the different directions that the
histories of the two countries took after the seventeenth century.

THEME7
Changing Cultural
Traditions
FROM the fourteenth to the end of the seventeenth century,
towns were growing in many countries of Europe. A distinct
‘urban culture’ also developed. Townspeople began to think
of themselves as more ‘civilised’ than rural people. Towns –
particularly Florence, Venice and Rome – became centres of
art and learning. Artists and writers were patronised by the
rich and the aristocratic. The invention of printing at the same
time made books and prints available to many people,
including those living in distant towns or countries. A sense
of history also developed in Europe, and people contrasted
their ‘modern’ world with the ‘ancient’ one of the Greeks and
Romans.
Religion came to be seen as something which each
individual should choose for himself. The church’s earth-
centric belief was overturned by scientists who began to
understand the solar system, and new geographical
knowledge overturned the Europe-centric view that the
Mediterranean Sea was the centre of the world.
(see Theme 8)
There is a vast amount of material on European history from
the fourteenth century – documents, printed books, paintings,
sculptures, buildings, textiles. Much of this has been
carefully preserved in archives, art galleries and museums
in Europe and America.
From the nineteenth century, historians used the term
‘Renaissance’ (literally, rebirth) to describe the cultural
changes of this period. The historian who emphasised these
most was a Swiss scholar – Jacob Burckhardt (1818–97) of
the University of Basle in Switzerland. He was a student of
the German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886).
Ranke had taught him that the primary concern of the
historian was to write about states and politics using papers
and files of government departments. Burckhardt was
dissatisfied with these very limited goals that his master had
set out for him. To him politics was not the be-all and end-
all in history writing. History was as much concerned with
culture as with politics.
In 1860, he wrote a book called The Civilisation of the
Renaissance in Italy, in which he called his readers’ attention
to literature, architecture and painting to tell the story of how
a new ‘humanist’ culture had flowered in Italian towns from

the fourteenth to the seventeenth century. This culture, he
wrote, was characterised by a new belief – that man, as an
individual, was capable of making his own decisions and
developing his skills. He was ‘modern’, in contrast to
‘medieval’ man whose thinking had been controlled by the
church.
The Revival of Italian Cities
After the fall of the western Roman Empire, many of the towns that
had been political and cultural centres in Italy fell into ruin. There was
no unified government, and the Pope in Rome, who was sovereign in
his own state, was not a strong political figure.
While western Europe was being reshaped by feudal bonds and
unified under the Latin Church, and eastern Europe under the
Byzantine Empire, and Islam was creating a common civilisation
further west, Italy was weak and fragmented. However, it was these
very developments that helped in the revival of Italian culture.
With the expansion of trade between the Byzantine Empire and the
Islamic countries, the ports on the Italian coast revived. From the
twelfth century, as the Mongols opened up trade with China via the
Silk Route (see Theme 5) and as trade with western European countries

also increased, Italian towns played a central role. They no longer saw
themselves as part of a powerful empire, but as independent city-
states. Two of these – Florence and Venice – were republics, and many
others were court-cities, ruled by princes.
One of the most vibrant cities was Venice, another was Genoa. They
were different from other parts of Europe – the clergy were not politically
dominant here, nor were there powerful feudal lords. Rich merchants
and bankers actively participated in governing the city, and this helped
the idea of citizenship to strike root. Even when these towns were
ruled by military despots, the pride felt by the townspeople in being
citizens did not weaken.
The City-State
Cardinal Gasparo Contarini (1483-1542) writes about the democratic government
of his city-state in The Commonwealth and Government of Venice (1534).
‘…to come to the institution of our Venetian commonwealth, the whole authority
of the city…is in that council, into which all the gentlemen of the City being once
past the age of 25 years are admitted...
Now first I am to yield you a reckoning how and with what wisdom it was
ordained by our ancestors, that the common people should not be admitted into
this company of citizens, in whose
authority [lies] the whole power of
the commonwealth... Because many
troubles and popular tumults arise
in those cities, whose government is
swayed by the common people…
many were of contrary opinion,
deeming that it would do well, if
this manner of governing the
commonwealth should rather be
defined by ability and abundance
of riches. Contrariwise the honest
citizens, and those that are liberally
brought up, oftentimes fall to
poverty...  Therefore our wise and
prudent ancestors... ordered that this
definition of the public rule should
go rather by the nobility of lineage,
than by the estimation of wealth: yet with that temperature [proviso], that men of
chief and supreme nobility should not have this rule alone (for that would rather
have been the power of a few than a commonwealth) but also every other citizen
whosoever not ignobly born: so that all which were noble by birth, or ennobled
by virtue, did...obtain this right of government.’
G. Bellini’s ‘The Recovery of the Relic of the Holy
Cross’ was painted in 1500, to recall an event of
1370, and is set in fifteenth-century Venice.

Universities and Humanism
The earliest universities in Europe had been set up in Italian towns. The
universities of Padua and Bologna had been centres of legal studies
from the eleventh century. Commerce being the chief activity in the city,
there was an increasing demand for lawyers and notaries (a combination
of solicitor and record-keeper) to write and interpret rules and written
agreements without which trade on a large scale was not possible. Law
was therefore a popular subject of study, but there was now a shift in
emphasis. It was studied in the context of earlier Roman culture.
Francesco Petrarch (1304-78) represented this change. To Petrarch,
antiquity was a distinctive civilisation which could be best understood
through the actual words of the ancient Greeks and Romans. He
therefore stressed the importance of a close reading of ancient authors.
This educational programme implied that there was much to be
learnt which religious teaching alone could not give. This was the
culture which historians in the nineteenth century were to label
‘humanism’. By the early fifteenth century, the term ‘humanist’
was used for masters who taught grammar, rhetoric, poetry,
history and moral philosophy. The Latin word humanitas,
from which ‘humanities’ was derived, had been used many
centuries ago by the Roman lawyer and essayist Cicero
(106-43 BCE), a contemporary of Julius Caesar, to mean culture.
These subjects were not drawn from or connected with religion,
and emphasised skills developed by individuals through discussion
and debate.

Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-94), a humanist of Florence, wrote
on the importance of debate in On the Dignity of Man (1486).
‘For [Plato and Aristotle] it was certain that, for the attainment of
the knowledge of truth they were always seeking for themselves,
nothing is better than to attend as often as possible the exercise of
debate. For just as bodily energy is strengthened by gymnastic
exercise, so beyond doubt in this wrestling-place of letters, as it were,
energy of mind becomes far stronger and more vigorous.’
These revolutionary ideas attracted attention in many other
universities, particularly in the newly established university in Petrarch’s
own home-town of Florence. Till the end of the thirteenth century,
this city had not made a mark as a centre of trade or of learning, but
things changed dramatically in the fifteenth century. A city is known
by its great citizens as much as by its wealth, and Florence had come
to be known because of Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), a layman who
wrote on religious themes, and Giotto (1267-1337), an artist who
painted lifelike portraits, very different from the stiff figures done by
earlier artists. From then it developed as the most exciting intellectual
city in Italy and as a centre of artistic creativity. The term ‘Renaissance
Man’ is often used to describe a person with many interests and skills,
because many of the individuals who became well known at this time
were people of many parts. They were scholar-diplomat-theologian-
artist combined in one.
The Humanist View of History
Humanists thought that they were restoring ‘true civilisation’ after
centuries of darkness, for they believed that a ‘dark age’ had set in
after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Following them, later scholars
unquestioningly assumed that a ‘new age’ had begun in Europe from
the fourteenth century. The term ‘Middle Ages’/‘medieval period’ was

used for the millennium (thousand years) after the fall of Rome. In the
‘Middle Ages’, they argued, the Church had had such complete control
over men’s minds that all the learning of the Greeks and Romans had
been blotted out. The humanists used the word ‘modern’ for the period
from the fifteenth century.

Recently, historians have questioned this division. With more research
being done and more being found out about Europe in this period,
scholars are increasingly reluctant to make sharp divisions between
centuries in terms of being culturally vibrant or otherwise. It seems
unfair to label any period as the ‘Dark Ages’.
Science and Philosophy:
The Arabs’ Contribution
Much of the writings of the Greeks and Romans had been familiar to
monks and clergymen through the ‘Middle Ages’, but they had not
made these widely known. In the fourteenth century, many scholars
began to read translated works of Greek writers like Plato and Aristotle.
For this they were indebted not to their own scholars but to Arab
translators who had carefully preserved and translated ancient
manuscripts (Plato was Aflatun, and Aristotle Aristu in Arabic).
While some European scholars read Greek in Arabic translation, the
Greeks translated works of Arabic and Persian scholars for further
transmission to other Europeans. These were works on natural science,
mathematics, astronomy, medicine and chemistry. Ptolemy’s Almagest
(a work on astronomy, written in Greek before 140 CE and later translated
into Arabic) carries the Arabic definite article ‘al’, which brings out the
Arabic connection. Among the Muslim writers who were regarded as men
of wisdom in the Italian world were Ibn Sina* (‘Avicenna’ in Latin, 980-
1037), an Arab physician and philosopher of Bukhara in Central Asia,
and al-Razi (‘Rhazes’), author of a medical encyclopaedia. Ibn Rushd
(‘Averroes’ in Latin, 1126-98), an Arab philosopher of Spain, tried to
resolve the tension between philosophical knowledge ( faylasuf ) and
religious beliefs. His method was adopted by Christian thinkers.
Humanists reached out to people in a variety of ways. Though the
curricula in universities continued to be dominated by law, medicine
and theology, humanist subjects slowly began to be introduced in
schools, not just in Italy but in other European countries as well.

Artists and Realism
Formal education was not the only way through which humanists
shaped the minds of their age. Art, architecture and books were
wonderfully effective in transmitting humanist ideas.
‘ “Art” is embedded in nature; he who can extract it, has
it… Moreover, you may demonstrate much of your work
by geometry. The more closely your work abides by life
in its form, so much the better will it appear…No man
shall ever be able to make a beautiful figure    out of his
own imagination unless he has well stored his mind by
much copying from life.’
– Albrecht Durer (1471-1528)
This sketch by Durer (Praying Hands) gives us a sense
of Italian culture in the sixteenth century, when people
were deeply religious, but also had a sense of confidence
in man’s ability to achieve near-perfection and to unravel
the mysteries of the world and the universe.
Artists were inspired by studying works of the past. The material
remains of Roman culture were sought with as much excitement as
ancient texts: a thousand years after
the fall of Rome, fragments of art were
discovered in the ruins of ancient Rome
and other deserted cities. Their
admiration for the figures of ‘perfectly’
proportioned men and women sculpted
so many centuries ago, made Italian
sculptors want to continue that
tradition. In 1416, Donatello (1386-
1466) broke new ground with his lifelike
statues.
Artists’ concern to be accurate was
helped by the work of scientists. To
study bone structures, artists went to
the laboratories of medical schools.
Andreas Vesalius (1514-64), a Belgian
and a professor of medicine at the
University of Padua, was the first to
dissect the human body. This was the
beginning of modern physiology.

This self-portrait is by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) who had an
amazing range of interests from botany and anatomy to
mathematics and art. He painted the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.
One of his dreams was to be able to fly. He spent years observing
birds in flight, and designed a flying machine.
He signed his name ‘Leonardo da Vinci, disciple of experiment’.
Painters did not have older works to use as a model. But they, like
sculptors, painted as realistically as possible. They found that a
knowledge of geometry helped them understand perspective, and that
by noting the changing quality of light, their pictures acquired a three-
dimensional quality. The use of oil as a medium for painting also gave
a greater richness of colour to paintings than before. In the colours
and designs of costumes in many paintings, there is evidence of the
influence of Chinese and Persian art, made available to them by the
Mongols. (see Theme 5)
Thus, anatomy, geometry, physics, as well as a strong sense of what
was beautiful, gave a new quality to Italian art, which was to be called
‘realism’ and which continued till the nineteenth century.
Architecture
The city of Rome revived in a spectacular way in the fifteenth century.
From 1417, the popes were politically stronger because the weakness
caused by the election of two rival popes since 1378 had ended. They
actively encouraged the study of Rome’s history. The ruins in Rome
were carefully excavated by archaeologists
(archaeology was a new skill). This inspired a
‘new’ style in architecture, which was actually
a revival of the imperial Roman style – now
called ‘classical’. Popes, wealthy merchants and
aristocrats employed architects who were
familiar with classical architecture. Artists and
sculptors were also to decorate buildings with
paintings, sculptures and reliefs.
Some individuals were skilled equally as
painters, sculptors and architects. The most
impressive example is Michelangelo Buonarroti
(1475-1564) – immortalised by the ceiling he
painted for the Pope in the Sistine Chapel, the
sculpture called ‘The Pieta’ and his design of
the dome of St Peter’s Church, all in Rome.

who designed the spectacular Duomo of

Another remarkable change was that from this time, artists were
known individually, by name, not as members of a group or a guild,
as earlier.
The First Printed Books
If people in other countries wanted to see paintings,
sculptures or buildings of great artists, they had to
travel to Italy. But in the case of the written word,
what was written in Italy travelled to other countries.
This was because of the greatest revolution of the
sixteenth century – the mastery of the technology of
printing. For this, Europeans were indebted to other
peoples– the Chinese, for printing technology, and to
Mongol rulers because European traders and
diplomats had become familiar with it during visits to
their courts. (This was also the case with three other
important innovations – firearms, the compass and
the abacus.)
Earlier, texts existed in a few hand-written copies.
In 1455, 150 copies of the Bible were printed in the
workshop of Johannnes Gutenberg (1400-1458), the
German who made the first printing press. Earlier, a
monk would have taken the same amount of time to
write out one copy of the Bible!
By 1500, many classical texts, nearly all in Latin,
had been printed in Italy. As printed books became
available, it was possible to buy them, and students
did not have to depend solely on lecture-notes. Ideas,
opinions and information moved more widely and more
rapidly than ever before. A printed book promoting
new ideas could quickly reach hundreds of readers.
This also made it possible for individuals to read books,
since it was possible to buy copies for oneself. This
developed the reading habit among people.
The chief reason that the humanist culture of Italy
spread more rapidly across the Alps from the end of
the fifteenth century is that printed books were
circulating. This also explains why earlier intellectual
movements had been limited to particular regions.
A New Concept of Human Beings
One of the features of humanist culture was a slackening of the control
of religion over human life. Italians were strongly attracted to material
wealth, power and glory, but they were not necessarily irreligious.
Francesco Barbaro (1390-1454), a humanist from Venice, wrote a

pamphlet defending acquisition of wealth as a virtue. In On Pleasure,
Lorenzo Valla (1406-1457), who believed that the study of history leads
man to strive for a life of perfection, criticised the Christian injunction
against pleasure. There was also a concern at this time with good
manners – how one should speak politely and dress correctly, what
skills a person of culture should learn.
Humanism also implied that individuals were capable of shaping
their own lives through means other than the mere pursuit of power
and money. This ideal was closely tied with the belief that human
nature was many-sided, which went against the three separate orders
that feudal society believed in.
Niccolo Machiavelli wrote about human nature in the fifteenth
chapter of his book, The Prince (1513).
‘So, leaving aside imaginary things, and referring only to those
which truly exist, I say that whenever men are discussed (and
especially princes, who are more exposed to view), they are noted
for various qualities which earn them either praise or condemnation.
Some, for example, are held to be generous, and others miserly.
Some are held to be benefactors, others are called grasping; some
cruel, some compassionate; one man faithless, another faithful; one
man effeminate and cowardly, another fierce and courageous; one
man courteous, another proud; one man lascivious, another pure;
one guileless, another crafty; one stubborn, another flexible; one
grave, another frivolous; one religious, another sceptical; and so
forth.’
Machiavelli believed that ‘all men are bad and ever ready to
display their vicious nature partly because of the fact that human
desires are insatiable’. The most powerful motive Machiavelli saw
as the incentive for every human action is self-interest.
The Aspirations of Women
The new ideal of individuality and citizenship excluded women.
Men from aristocratic families dominated public life and were the
decision-makers in their families. They educated their sons to take
their place in family businesses or in public life, at times sending their
younger sons to join the Church. Although their dowries were invested
in the family businesses, women generally had no say in how their
husbands should run their business. Often, marriages were intended
to strengthen business alliances. If an adequate dowry could not be
arranged, daughters were sent to convents to live the life of a nun.
Obviously, the public role of women was limited and they were looked
upon as keepers of the households.

162  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The position of women in the families of merchants, however, was
somewhat different. Shopkeepers were very often assisted by their
wives in running the shop. In families of merchants and bankers,
wives looked after the businesses when the male members were away
on work. The early death of a merchant compelled his widow to
perform a larger public role than was the case in aristocratic families.
A few women were intellectually very creative and sensitive about
the importance of a humanist education. ‘Even though the study of
letters promises and offers no reward for women and no dignity’,
wrote the Venetian Cassandra Fedele (1465-1558), ‘every woman
ought to seek and embrace these studies.’ She was one of a handful
of women who questioned the idea that women were incapable of
achieving the qualities of a humanist scholar. Fedele was known for
her proficiency in Greek and Latin, and was invited to give orations
at the University of Padua.
Fedele’s writings bring into focus the general regard for education
in that age. She was one of many Venetian women writers who
criticised the republic ‘for creating a highly limited definition of
freedom that favoured the desires of men over those of women’.
Another remarkable woman was the Marchesa of Mantua, Isabella
d’Este (1474-1539). She ruled the state while her husband was
absent, and the court of Mantua, a small state, was famed for its
intellectual brilliance. Women’s writings revealed their conviction
that they should have economic power, property and education to
achieve an identity in a world dominated by men.
Balthasar Castiglione, author and diplomat, wrote in his book
The Courtier (1528):
‘I hold that a woman should in no way resemble a man as regards
her ways, manners, words, gestures and bearing. Thus just as it is
very fitting that a man should display a certain robust and sturdy
manliness, so it is well for a woman to have a certain soft and
delicate tenderness, with an air of feminine sweetness in her every
movement, which, in her going and staying and whatsoever she
does, always makes her appear a woman, without any resemblance
to a man. If this precept be added to the rules that these gentlemen
have taught the courtier, then I think that she ought to be able to

Debates within Christianity
Trade and travel, military conquest and diplomatic contacts linked
Italian towns and courts with the world beyond. The new culture was
admired and imitated by the educated and the wealthy. Very few of the
new ideas filtered down to the ordinary man who, after all, could not
read or write.
In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, many scholars in
universities in north Europe were attracted to humanist ideas. Like
their Italian colleagues, they too focused on classical Greek and Roman
texts along with the holy books of the Christians. But, unlike Italy,
where professional scholars dominated the humanist movement, in north
Europe humanism attracted many members of the Church. They called
on Christians to practise religion in the way laid down in the ancient
texts of their religion, discarding unnecessary rituals, which they
condemned as later additions to a simple religion. Theirs was a radically
new view of human beings as free and rational agents. Later philosophers
were to return to this over and over again, inspired by the belief in a
distant God who created man but allowed him complete freedom to live
his life freely, in pursuit of happiness ‘here and now’.
Christian humanists like Thomas More (1478 -1535) in England
and Erasmus (1466-1536) in Holland felt that the Church had become
an institution marked by greed, extorting money at will from ordinary
people. One of the favourite methods of the clergy was to sell
‘indulgences’, documents which apparently freed the buyer from the
burden of the sins he had committed. Christians came to realise from
printed translations of the Bible in local languages that their religion
did not permit such practices.
In almost every part of Europe, peasants began to rebel against the
taxes imposed by the Church. While the common folk resented the
extortions of churchmen, princes found their interference in the work
of the state irritating. They were pleased when the humanists pointed
out that the clergy’s claim to judicial and fiscal powers originated from
a document called the ‘Donation of Constantine’ supposed to have
been issued by Constantine, the first Christian Roman Emperor.
Humanist scholars were able to point out that this was not genuine,
and had been forged later.
In 1517, a young German monk called Martin Luther
(1483-1546) launched a campaign against the Catholic Church and
argued that a person did not need priests to establish contact with
God. He asked his followers to have complete faith in God, for faith
alone could guide them to the right life and entry into heaven. This
movement – called the Protestant Reformation – led to the churches
in Germany and Switzerland breaking their connection with the Pope
and the Catholic Church. In Switzerland, Luther’s ideas were
popularised by Ulrich Zwingli (1484-1531) and later by Jean Calvin
(1509-64). Backed by merchants, the reformers had greater popular

appeal in towns, while in rural areas the Catholic Church managed
to retain its influence. Other German reformers, like the Anabaptists,
were even more radical: they blended the idea of salvation with the
end of all forms of social oppression. They said that since God had
created all people as equal, they were not expected to pay taxes and
had the right to choose their priests. This appealed to peasants
oppressed by feudalism.
William Tyndale (1494-1536), an English Lutheran who translated
the Bible into English in 1506, defended Protestantism thus:
‘In this they be all agreed, to drive you from the knowledge of the
scripture, and that ye shall not have the text thereof in the mother-
tongue, and to keep the world still in darkness, to the intent they
might sit in the consciences of the people, through vain superstition
and false doctrine, to satisfy their proud ambition, and insatiable
covetousness, and to exalt their own honour above king and
emperor, yea, and above God himself... Which thing only moved
me to translate the New Testament. Because I had perceived by
experience, how that it was impossible to establish the lay-people
in any truth, except the scripture were plainly laid before their eyes
in their mother-tongue, that they might see the process, order, and
meaning of the text. ‘
Luther did not support radicalism. He called upon German rulers
to suppress the peasants’ rebellion, which they did in 1525. But
radicalism survived, and merged with the resistance of Protestants in
France, who, persecuted by the Catholic rulers, started claiming the
right of a people to remove an oppressive ruler and to choose someone
of their own liking. Eventually, in France, as in many other parts of
Europe, the Catholic Church allowed Protestants to worship as they
chose. In England, the rulers ended the connection with the Pope. The
king/queen was from then onwards the head of the Church.
The Catholic Church itself did not escape the impact of these ideas,
and began to reform itself from within. In Spain and in Italy, churchmen
emphasised the need for a simple life and service to the poor. In Spain,
Ignatius Loyola, in an attempt to combat Protestantism, set up the
Society of Jesus in 1540. His followers were called Jesuits, whose mission
was to serve the poor and to widen their knowledge of other cultures.

The Copernican Revolution
The Christian notion of man as a sinner was questioned from an entirely
different angle – by scientists. The turning point in European science
came with the work of Copernicus (1473-1543), a contemporary of
Martin Luther. Christians had believed that the earth was a sinful
place and the heavy burden of sin made it immobile. The earth stood
at the centre of the universe around which moved the celestial
planets.
Copernicus asserted that the planets, including the
earth, rotate around the sun. A devout Christian,
Copernicus was afraid of the possible reaction to his
theory by traditionalist clergymen. For this reason, he
did not want his manuscript, De revolutionibus (The
Rotation) to be printed. On his deathbed, he gave it to his
follower, Joachim Rheticus. It took time for people to
accept this idea. It was much later – more than half a
century later, in fact – that the difference between ‘heaven’
and earth was bridged through the writings of
astronomers like Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) and Galileo
Galilei (1564-1642). The theory of the earth as part of a
sun-centred system was made popular by Kepler’s
Cosmographical Mystery, which demonstrated that the
planets move around the sun not in circles but in ellipses.
Galileo confirmed the notion of the dynamic world in his
work The Motion. This revolution in science reached its climax with
Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation.

Reading the Universe
Galileo once remarked that the Bible that lights the road to heaven
does not say much on how the heavens work. The work of these
thinkers showed that knowledge, as distinct from belief, was based
on observation and experiments. Once these scientists had shown
the way, experiments and investigations into what came to be called
physics, chemistry and biology expanded rapidly. Historians were to
label this new approach to the knowledge of man and nature the
Scientific Revolution.
Consequently, in the minds of sceptics and non-believers, God began
to be replaced by Nature as the source of creation. Even those who
retained their faith in God started talking about a distant God who does
not directly regulate the act of living in the material world. Such ideas
were popularised through scientific societies that established a new
scientific culture in the public domain. The Paris Academy, established
in 1670 and the Royal Society in London for the promotion of natural
knowledge, formed in 1662, held lectures and conducted experiments
for public viewing.
Was there a European ‘Renaissance’ in the
Fourteenth Century?
Let us now reconsider the concept of the ‘Renaissance’. Can we see
this period as marking a sharp break with the past and the rebirth of
ideas from Greek and Roman traditions? Was the earlier period (twelfth
and thirteenth centuries) a time of darkness?
Recent writers, like Peter Burke of England, have suggested that
Burckhardt was exaggerating the sharp difference between this period
and the one that preceded it, by using the term ‘Renaissance’, which
implies that the Greek and Roman civilisations were reborn at this
time, and that scholars and artists of this period substituted the pre-
Christian world-view for the Christian one. Both arguments were
exaggerated. Scholars in earlier centuries had been familiar with Greek
and Roman cultures, and religion continued to be a very important
part of people’s lives.
To contrast the Renaissance as a period of dynamism and artistic
creativity, and the Middle Ages as a period of gloom and lack of
development is an over-simplification. Many elements associated with
the Renaissance in Italy can be traced back to the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. It has been suggested by some historians that
in the ninth century in France, there had been similar literary and
artistic blossoming.
The cultural changes in Europe at this time were not shaped only
by the ‘classical’ civilisation of Rome and Greece. The archaeological
and literary recovery of Roman culture did create a great admiration of
that civilisation. But technologies and skills in Asia had moved far
© NCERT

ahead of what the Greeks and Romans had known. Much more of the
world had become connected, and the new techniques of navigation
(see Theme 8) enabled people to sail much further than had been
possible earlier. The expansion of Islam and the Mongol conquests had
linked Asia and North Africa with Europe, not politically but in terms
of trade and of learning skills. The Europeans learned not just from
the Greeks and Romans, but from India, from Arabia, from Iran, from
Central Asia and China. These debts were not acknowledged for a long
time because when the history of this period started to be written,
historians saw it from a Europe-centred viewpoint.
An important change that did happen in this period was that
gradually the ‘private’ and the ‘public’ spheres of life began to become
separate: the ‘public’ sphere meant the area of government and of
formal religion; the ‘private’ sphere included the family and personal
religion. The individual had a private as well as a public role. He was
not simply a member of one of the ‘three orders’; he was also a person
in his own right. An artist was not just a member of a guild, he was
known for himself. In the eighteenth century, this sense of the individual
would be expressed in a political form, in the belief that all individuals
had equal political rights.
Another development was that the different regions of Europe
started to have their separate sense of identity, based on language.
Europe, earlier united partly by the Roman Empire and later by Latin
and Christianity, was now dissolving into states, each united by a
common language.

CONFRONTATION OF
CULTURES
THIS chapter will examine some aspects of the encounters
between Europeans and the people of the Americas between
the fifteenth and the seventeenth centuries. Some Europeans
ventured out on unknown oceans in order to find trading
routes to areas where spices and silver were to be obtained.
The first to do this were the Spanish and the Portuguese.
They persuaded the Pope to give them the exclusive right to
rule over any new regions they might locate. Christopher
Columbus, an Italian, sponsored by the rulers of Spain, sailed
west in 1492, and thought that the lands he had reached
were ‘the Indies’ (India and countries east of India about
which he had read in the Travels of Marco Polo).
Later exploration indicated that the ‘Indians’ of the ‘New
World’ actually belonged to different cultural groups and were
not part of Asia. Two types of culture were to be found in the
Americas. There were small subsistence economies in the
Caribbean region and in Brazil. There were also powerful
monarchical systems based on well-developed agriculture and
mining. These, like the Aztecs and Mayas of central America
and the Incas of Peru, also had monumental architecture.
The exploration and later the settlement of South America
were to have disastrous consequences for the native people
and their cultures. It also marked the beginning of the slave
trade, with Europeans selling slaves from Africa to work in
plantations and mines in the Americas.
European conquest of the people of America was
accompanied by the ruthless destruction of their manuscripts
and monuments. It was only in the late nineteenth century
that anthropologists began to study these cultures. Still later,
archaeologists found the ruins of these civilisations. The Inca
city of Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911. Recently,
photographs taken from the air have shown traces of many
cities now covered by forest.
By contrast, we know the European side of the encounters
in great detail. The Europeans who went to the Americas
kept log-books and diaries of their journeys. There are records
left by officials and Jesuit missionaries (see Theme 7).
Europeans wrote about their ‘discovery’ of the Americas, and
when histories of the countries of America were written, these
were in terms of European settlements, with little reference
to the local people.

People have been living in North and South America and nearby islands
for thousands of years, and many migrations from Asia and from the
South Sea Islands have taken place over time. South America was (and
still is, in parts) densely forested and mountainous, and the Amazon,
the world’s largest river, flows through miles of dense forest. In Mexico
in central America, there were densely settled areas of habitation along
the coast and in the plains, while elsewhere villages were scattered over
forested areas.
Communities of the Caribbean and Brazil
The Arawakian Lucayos lived on a cluster of hundreds of small islands
in the Caribbean Sea, today known as the Bahamas, and the Greater
Antilles. They had been expelled from the Lesser Antilles by the Caribs,
a fierce tribe. In contrast to them, the Arawaks were a people who
preferred negotiation to conflict. Skilled boat-builders, they sailed the
open sea in dugout canoes (canoes made from hollow tree trunks). They
lived by hunting, fishing and agriculture, growing corn, sweet potatoes,
tubers and cassava.
A central cultural value was the organisation of people to produce
food collectively and to feed everyone in the community. They were
organised under clan elders. Polygamy was common. The Arawaks
were animists. As in many other societies, shamans played an
important role as healers and intermediaries between this world and
that of the supernatural.

The Arawaks used gold for ornaments, but did not attach the value
to the metal that the Europeans did. They were quite happy to exchange
gold for glass beads brought by the Europeans, because these seemed
so much more beautiful. The art of weaving was highly developed – the
hammock was one of their specialities, and one which captured the
imagination of the Europeans.
The Arawaks were generous and were happy to collaborate with the
Spanish in their search for gold. It was when Spanish policy became
brutal that they were forced to resist, but this was to have disastrous
consequences for them. Within twenty-five years of contact with the
Spanish very little remained of the Arawaks or their way of life.
People called the Tupinamba lived on the east coast of South America,
and in villages in the forests (the name ‘Brazil’ is derived from the
brazilwood tree). They could not clear the dense forests for cultivation
as they had no access to iron. But they had a healthy and plentiful
supply of fruits, vegetables and fish, and so did not have to depend on
agriculture. The Europeans who met them envied their happy freedom,
with no king, army or church to regulate their lives.
The State Systems of Central and South America
In contrast to the Caribbean and Brazil, there were some highly organised
states in central America. There was a generous surplus of corn, which
provided the basis for the urbanised civilisations of the Aztecs, Mayas and
Incas. The monumental architectural remains of these cities continue to
mesmerise visitors today.
The Aztecs
In the twelfth century, the Aztecs had migrated from the north into
the central valley of Mexico (named after their god Mexitli). They
expanded their empire by defeating different tribes, who were forced
to pay tribute.
Aztec society was hierarchical. The nobility included
those who were nobles by birth, priests, and others
who had been awarded the rank. The hereditary
nobility were a small minority who occupied the
senior positions in the government, the army and
the priesthood. The nobles chose from among
them a supreme leader who ruled until his death.
The king was regarded as the representative of
the sun on earth. Warriors, priests and nobles
were the most respected groups, but traders also
enjoyed many privileges and often served
the government as ambassadors and spies.
Talented artisans, physicians and wise teachers were
also respected.

Since land was limited, the Aztecs undertook reclamations. They
made chinampas, artificial islands, in Lake Mexico, by weaving huge
reed-mats and covering them with mud and plants. Between these
exceptionally fertile islands, canals were constructed on which, in 1325,
was built the capital city Tenochtitlan. Its palaces and pyramids rose
dramatically out of the lake. Because the Aztecs were frequently engaged
in war, the most impressive temples were dedicated to the gods of war
and the sun.
The empire rested on a rural base. People cultivated corn, beans,
squash, pumpkins, manioc root, potatoes and other crops. Land was
owned not by individuals but by clans, which also organised public
construction works. Peasants, like European serfs, were attached to
lands owned by the nobility and cultivated them in exchange for part
of the harvest. The poor would sometimes sell their children as slaves,
but this was usually only for a limited period, and slaves could buy
back their freedom.
The Aztecs made sure that all children went to school. Children of
the nobility attended the calmecac and were trained to become military
and religious leaders. All others went to the tepochcalli in
their neighbourhood, where they learned history,
myths, religion and ceremonial songs. Boys received
military training as well as training in agriculture and
the trades. Girls were trained in domestic skills.
In the early sixteenth century, the Aztec empire
was showing signs of strain. This was largely to do
with discontent among recently conquered peoples
who were looking for opportunities to break free from
central control.
The Mayas
The Mayan culture of Mexico
developed remarkably between
the eleventh and fourteenth
centuries, but in the sixteenth
century they had less political
power than the Aztecs. Corn
cultivation was central to their
culture, and many religious
ceremonies were centred on the
planting, growing and harvesting of
corn. Efficient agricultural production
generated surplus, which helped the ruling
classes, priests and chiefs to invest in architecture
and in the development of astronomy and
mathematics. The Mayas devised a pictographic form of
writing that has only been partially deciphered.

The Incas of Peru
The largest of the indigenous civilisations in South America was that
of the Quechuas or Incas in Peru. In the twelfth century the first Inca,
Manco Capac, established his capital at Cuzco. Expansion began under
the ninth Inca and at its maximum extent the Inca empire stretched
3,000 miles from Ecuador to Chile.
The empire was highly centralised, with the king representing the
highest source of authority. Newly conquered tribes were absorbed
effectively; every subject was required to speak Quechua, the language
of the court. Each tribe was ruled independently by a council of elders,
but the tribe as a whole owed its allegiance to the ruler. At the same
time, local rulers were rewarded for their military co-operation. Thus,
like the Aztec empire, the Inca empire resembled a confederacy, with the
Incas in control. There are no precise figures of the population, but it
would seem that it included over a million people.
Like the Aztecs, the Incas too were magnificent builders. They
built roads through mountains from Ecuador to Chile. Their forts
were built of stone slabs that were so
perfectly cut that they did not require
mortar. They used labour-intensive
technology to carve and move stones from
nearby rock falls. Masons shaped the
blocks, using an effective but simple
method called flaking. Many stones
weighed more than 100 metric tons, but
they did not have any wheeled vehicles
to transport these. Labour was organised
and very tightly managed.
The basis of the Inca civilisation was
agriculture. To cope with the infertile soil
conditions, they terraced hillsides and
developed systems of drainage and
irrigation. It has been recently pointed
out that in 1500, cultivation in the
Andean highlands was much greater than
what it is today. The Incas grew corn and
potatoes, and reared llamas for food and
labour.
Their weaving and pottery were of a high
quality. They did not develop a system of
writing. However, there was an accounting
system in place – the quipu, or cords upon
which knots were made to indicate specific
mathematical units. Some scholars now
suggest that the Incas wove a sort of code
into these threads.

Most visitors today wonder at the arts and skills of the Incas. However,
there are some like the Chilean poet Neruda, who thought of the hours
of hard work that thousands of people must have been forced to put
in. And all that to achieve such high levels of agricultural output,
such remarkable architecture, and such exquisite crafts, in this difficult
environment.
‘Look at me from the depths of the earth,
tiller of fields, weaver, reticent shepherd,
mason high on your treacherous scaffolding,
iceman of Andean tears,
jeweler with crushed fingers,
farmer anxious among his seedlings,
potter wasted among his clays –
bring to the cup of this new life
your ancient buried sorrows.
Show me your blood and your furrow;
say to me: here I was scourged
because a gem was dull or because the earth
failed to give up in time its tithe of corn or stone.’
– Pablo Neruda (1904-73), The Heights of Machu Picchu, 1943.
The organisation of the Inca empire, with its pyramid-like structure,
meant that if the Inca chief was captured, the chain of command could
quickly come apart. This was precisely what happened when the
Spaniards decided to invade their country.
The cultures of the Aztecs and Incas had certain features in common,
and were very different from European culture. Society was
hierarchical, but there was no private ownership of resources by a few
people, as in Europe. Though priests and shamans were accorded an
exalted status, and large temples were built, in which gold was used
ritually, there was no great value placed on gold or silver. This was also
in marked contrast to contemporary European society.
Voyages of Exploration by Europeans
The people of South America and the Caribbean got to know of the
existence of European people when the latter began to sail across the
Atlantic Sea. The magnetic compass, which helped identify the cardinal
points accurately, had been known since 1380, but only in the fifteenth
century did people use it when they ventured on voyages into unknown
areas. By this time many improvements had been made in European
sailing ships. Larger ships were built, that could carry a huge quantity
of cargo as well as equipment to defend themselves if attacked by
enemy ships. The circulation of travel literature and books on
cosmography and geography created widespread interest right through
the fifteenth century.

174  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
In 1477, Ptolemy’s Geography (written 1,300 years earlier) became
available in print (see Theme 7) and thus came to be widely read.
According to Ptolemy, an Egyptian, the regions of the world were
arranged in terms of latitudes and longitudes. Reading these texts
gave Europeans some knowledge of the world, which they understood
to have three continents, namely, Europe, Asia and Africa. Ptolemy
had suggested that the world was spherical, but he underestimated
the width of the oceans. Europeans had no idea of the distance they
would have to travel in the Atlantic before they reached land. Since
they imagined it would be a short voyage, there were many who were
ready to venture forth recklessly beyond the known seas.
People from the Iberian peninsula – the Portuguese and the Spanish
– were the pioneers in the fifteenth-century voyages of exploration.
For a long time these were called ‘voyages of discovery’. Later historians,
however, argued that these were not the first voyages that people of
the “Old World” made to lands unknown to them. Arabs, Chinese and
Indians had navigated vast stretches of ocean, and sailors from the
Pacific Islands (the Polynesians and Micronesians) had made major
ocean crossings. The Vikings of Norway had reached North America in
the eleventh century.
Why were Spanish and Portuguese rulers in particular so receptive
to the idea of funding a maritime quest? What produced such a passion
for gold and treasure and for glory and titles? One may find the answers
in a combination of three motives: economic, religious and political.
The European economy went through a decline from the mid-
fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth centuries (see Theme 6). Plague and
wars led to depopulation in many parts of Europe, trade grew slack, and
there was a shortage of gold and silver, used for making European
coins. This situation was in stark contrast to the preceding period (from
the eleventh to the mid-fourteenth centuries) when growing trade had
supported Italian city-states and led to the accumulation of capital. In
the late fourteenth century, long-distance trade declined, and then
became difficult after the Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453.
Italians managed to do business with Turks, but were now required to
pay higher taxes on trade.
The possibility that many more people could be brought into the
fold of Christianity made many devout Christian Europeans ready to
face adventure.
As it happened, the ‘Crusades’ against the Turks (see Theme 4)
began as a religious war, but they increased Europe’s trade with Asia
and created a taste for the products of Asia, especially spices. If trade
could be followed by political control, with European countries
establishing ‘colonies’ in regions with a warmer climate, they would
benefit further.
When thinking of new regions where gold and spices might be found,
one possibility was West Africa, where Europeans had not traded directly
so far. Portugal, a small country which had gained independence from
Cosmography was
understood as the
science of mapping
the universe. It
described both
heaven and Earth,
but was seen as
distinct from
geography and
astronomy.

Spain since 1139, and which had developed fishing and sailing skills,
took the lead. Prince Henry of Portugal (called the Navigator) organised
the coasting of West Africa and attacked Ceuta in 1415. After that,
more expeditions were organised, and the Portuguese established a
trading station in Cape Bojador in Africa. Africans were captured and
enslaved, and gold dust yielded the precious metal.
In Spain, economic reasons encouraged individuals to become knights
of the ocean. The memory of the Crusades and the success of the
Reconquista fanned private ambitions and gave rise to contracts known
as capitulaciones. Under these contracts the Spanish ruler claimed
rights of sovereignty over newly conquered territories and gave rewards
to leaders of expeditions in the form of titles and the right to govern
the conquered lands.
The Atlantic Crossing
Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) was a self-taught man who sought
adventure and glory. Believing in prophecies, he was convinced that
his destiny lay in discovering a route to the East (the ‘Indies’) by sailing
westwards. He was inspired by reading Imago Mundi (a work on
astronomy and geography) by Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly written in 1410.
He submitted his plans to the Portuguese Crown, only to have them
turned down. He had better luck with the Spanish authorities who
sanctioned a modest expedition that set sail from the port of Palos on
3 August 1492.
Nothing, however, prepared Columbus and his crew for the long
Atlantic crossing that they embarked upon, or for the destination that
awaited them. The fleet was small, consisting of a small nao called Santa
Maria, and two caravels (small light ships) named Pinta and Nina.
Columbus himself commanded the Santa Maria along with 40 capable
sailors. The outward journey enjoyed fair trade winds but was long. For
33 days, the fleet sailed without sight of anything but sea and sky. By
this time, the crew became restive and some of them demanded that
they turn back.
On 12 October 1492, they sighted land; they had reached what
Columbus thought was India, but which was the island of Guanahani
in the Bahamas. (It is said that this name was given by Columbus,
who described the Islands as surrounded by shallow seas, baja mar in
Spanish.) They were welcomed by the Arawaks, who were happy to
share their food and provisions; in fact, their generosity made a deep
impression upon Columbus. As he wrote in his log-book, ‘They are so
ingenuous and free with all they have, that no one would believe it who
has not seen of it, anything they possess, if it be asked of them, they
never say no, on the contrary, they invite you to share it and show as
much love as if their hearts went with it’.
Columbus planted a Spanish flag in Guanahani (which he renamed
San Salvador), held a prayer service and, without consulting the local
Reconquista was
the military
reconquest of the
Iberian Peninsula
by Christian kings
from the Arabs in
1492.

between two countries, Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Gold was
not immediately available, but the explorers had heard that it could be
found in Hispaniola, in the mountain streams in the interior.
But before they could get very far, the expedition was overtaken by
accidents and had to face the hostility of the fierce Carib tribes. The
men clamoured to get back home. The return voyage proved more
difficult as the ships were worm-eaten and the crew tired and homesick.
The entire voyage took 32 weeks. Three more voyages followed, in the
course of which Columbus completed his explorations in the Bahamas
and the Greater Antilles, the South American mainland and its coast.
Subsequent voyages revealed that it was not the ‘Indies’ that the
Spaniards had found, but a new continent.
Columbus’s achievement had been to discover the boundaries of
what seemed like infinite seas and to demonstrate that five weeks’
sailing with the trade wind took one to the other side of the globe.
Since places are often given the names of individuals, it is curious that
Columbus is commemorated only in a small district in the USA and in
a country in north-western South America (Columbia), though he did
not reach either of these areas. The two continents were named after
Amerigo Vespucci, a geographer from Florence who realised how large
they might be, and described them as the ‘New World’. The name
‘America’ was first used by a German publisher in 1507.

Spanish expansion was based on a display of military strength with
the use of gunpowder and of horses. The local people were compelled
either to pay tribute or to work in gold and silver mines. The initial
discovery was typically followed by establishing a small settlement,
peopled by a few Spaniards who supervised the labour of the local
inhabitants. Local chieftains were enlisted to explore new lands and,
hopefully, more sources of gold. The greed for gold led to violent incidents
provoking local resistance. The Spanish friar Bartolome de las Casas,
the most severe critic of the Spanish conquerors, observed that the
Spanish often tested their swords on the naked flesh of the Arawaks.
To military repression and forced labour was added the ravages of
disease. The diseases of the Old World, particularly smallpox wreaked
havoc on the Arawaks whose lack of immunity resulted in large-scale
deaths. The local people imagined these diseases were caused by ‘invisible
bullets’ with which the Spaniards attacked them. The extinction of the
Arawaks and all traces of their way of life is a silent reminder of their
tragic encounter with Spaniards.
The expeditions of Columbus were followed by a sustained and
successful exploration of Central and South America. Within half a
century, the Spanish had explored and laid claim to a vast area of the
western hemisphere, from approximately latitudes 40 degrees north
to 40 degrees south, without anyone challenging them.

Before this, the Spanish conquered lands of two great empires of
the region. This was largely the work of two individuals: Hernan Cortes
(1488-1547) and Francisco Pizarro (1478-1541). Their explorations
were financed by members of the landed gentry in Spain, officials of
municipal councils and noblemen. Those joining the expeditions
supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share of the booty
they expected from the conquests.
Cortes and the Aztecs
Cortes and his soldiers (called conquistadores) conquered Mexico swiftly
and ruthlessly. In 1519, Cortes set sail from Cuba to Mexico, where he
made friends with the Totonacs, a group who wanted to secede from
Aztec rule. The Aztec king, Montezuma, sent an official to meet him.
He was terrified at the aggressiveness of the Spanish, their gunpowder
and their horses. Montezuma himself was convinced that Cortes was
the reincarnation of an exiled god who had returned to avenge himself.
Dona Marina
Bernard Diaz del Castillo(1495-1584) wrote in his True History of the
Conquest of Mexico that the people of Tabasco gave Cortes a woman
attendant called Dona Marina. She was fluent in three local
languages, and was able to play a crucial role as interpreter for
Cortes. ‘This was the great beginning of our conquests,and without
Dona Marina we could not have understood the language of New
Spain and Mexico.’
Diaz thought she was a princess, but the Mexicans called her
‘Malinche’, a word meaning ‘betrayal’. Malinchista means someone
who slavishly copies the costumes and language of another people.
The Spaniards pressed against the Tlaxcalans, fierce fighters who
submitted only after a stiff resistance. The Spaniards proceeded to
massacre them cruelly. Then they marched to Tenochtitlan, which
they reached on 8 November 1519.
The invading Spaniards were dumbstruck at the sight of
Tenochtitlan. It was five times larger than Madrid and had 100,000
inhabitants, twice the population of Seville, Spain’s largest city.
Cortes was cordially received by Montezuma. The Aztecs led the
Spaniards into the heart of the city, where the Emperor showered
them with gifts. His people were apprehensive, having heard of the
massacre of the Tlaxcalans. An Aztec account described the situation:
‘It was as though Tenochtitlan had given shelter to a monster. The
people of Tenochtitlan felt as if everyone had eaten stupefying
mushrooms... as if they had seen something astonishing. Terror
dominated everyone, as if all the world were being disemboweled...
people fell into a fearful slumber.’
Bernard Diaz
wrote:
‘And when we saw
all those cities and
villages built in
the water, and
other towns on dry
land, and that
straight and level
causeway leading
to Mexico City,
we were
astounded. These
great towns and
buildings rising
from the water all
made of stone,
seemed like an
enchanted vision
from the tale of
Amadis. Indeed,
some of our
soldiers asked
whether it was not
a dream.’

The fears of the Aztecs proved to be well founded. Cortes without
any explanation placed the Emperor under house arrest and attempted
to rule in his name. In an attempt to formalise the Emperor’s
submission to Spain, Cortes installed Christian images in the Aztec
temple. Montezuma, on his part, suggested a compromise and placed
both Aztec and Christian images in the temple.
At this point, Cortes had to leave his deputy in charge and hurry
back to Cuba. The high-handedness of the Spanish occupation and
their incessant demands for gold provoked a general uprising.
Alvarado ordered a massacre during the Aztec spring festival of
Huizilpochtli. When Cortes returned
on 25 June 1520, he had on his
hands a full-blown crisis. The
causeways were cut, the bridges
taken away and the net closed. The
Spaniards faced acute shortages of
food and drinking water. Cortes was
forced to retreat.
Around this time, Montezuma died
under mysterious circumstances. The
Aztecs continued to fight the
Spaniards. 600 conquistadores and
many more of their Tlaxcalan allies
were killed in what is known as the
Night of Tears. Cortes was forced to
retreat to Tlaxcala to plan his strategy
against the newly elected king,
Cuatemoc. By then, the Aztecs were
dying from the dreaded smallpox
which had come with the Europeans.
With just 180 soldiers and 30 horses,
Cortes moved into Tenochtitlan as the
Aztecs prepared for their final stand.
The Aztecs thought they could see
omens foretelling that their end was
near, and because of this the Emperor
chose to give up his life.
The conquest of Mexico had taken
two years. Cortes became Captain-
General of New Spain in Mexico and
was showered with honours by
Charles V. From Mexico, the
Spaniards extended their control
over Guatemala, Nicaragua and the
Honduras.

180  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Pizarro and the Incas
Pizarro, in contrast to Cortes, was uneducated and poor when he
joined the army and found his way to the Caribbean Islands in 1502.
He had heard stories about the Inca kingdom as a land of silver and
gold (El-dor-ado). He made repeated attempts to reach it from the
Pacific. On one of his journeys back home, he was able to meet the
Spanish king and show him beautifully designed gold jars of Inca
workmanship. The king’s greed was aroused, and he promised Pizarro
the governorship of the Inca lands if he conquered it. Pizarro planned
to follow Cortes’ method, but was disconcerted to find that the situation
in the Inca empire was different.
In 1532, Atahualpa secured the throne of the Inca empire after a
civil war. Pizarro arrived on the scene and captured the king after
setting a trap for him. The king offered a roomful of gold as ransom for
his release – the most extravagant ransom recorded in history – but
Pizarro did not honour his promise. He had the king executed, and his
followers went on a looting spree. This was followed by the occupation
of the country. The cruelty of the conquerors provoked an uprising in
1534 that continued for two years, during which time thousands died
in war and due to epidemics.
In another five years, the Spanish had located the vast silver mines
in Potosi (in Upper Peru, modern Bolivia) and to work these they made
the Inca people into slaves.
Cabral and Brazil
The Portuguese occupation of Brazil occurred by accident. In 1500, a
grand procession of ships set out from Portugal for India, headed by
Pedro Alvares Cabral. To avoid stormy seas, he made a wide loop around
West Africa, and found to his surprise that he had reached the coast
of present-day Brazil. As it happened, this eastern part of South America
was within the section assigned on the map to Portugal by the Pope,
so they regarded it as indisputably theirs.
The Portuguese were more eager to increase their trade with western
India than with Brazil, which did not promise any gold. But there was
one natural resource there which they exploited: timber. The brazilwood
tree, after which the Europeans named the region, produced a beautiful
red dye. The natives readily agreed to cut the trees and carry the logs
to the ships in exchange for iron knives and saws, which they regarded
as marvels. (’For one sickle, knife or comb [they] would bring loads of
hens, monkeys, parrots, honey, wax, cotton thread and whatever else
these poor people had’.)
‘Why do you people, French and Portuguese, come from so far away
to seek wood? Don’t you have wood in your country?’ a native asked a
French priest. At the end of their discussion, he said ‘I can see that
you are great madmen. You cross the sea and suffer great inconvenience

and work so hard to accumulate riches for your children. Is the land
that nourished you not sufficient to feed them too? We have fathers,
mothers and children whom we love. But we are certain that after our
death the land that nourished us will also feed them. We therefore rest
without further cares.’
This trade in timber led to fierce battles between Portuguese and
French traders. The Portuguese won because they decided to ‘settle’ in/
colonise the coast. In 1534, the king of Portugal divided the coast of
Brazil into fourteen hereditary ‘captaincies’. To the Portuguese who
wanted to live there he gave landownership rights, and the right to
make the local people into slaves. Many Portuguese settlers were veterans
of the wars in Goa, in India, and were brutal to the local people.
In the 1540s, the Portuguese began to grow sugarcane on large
plantations and built mills to extract sugar, which was then sold in
Europe. In this very hot and humid climate they depended on the
natives to work the sugar mills. When the natives refused to do this
exhausting and dreary work, the mill-owners resorted to kidnapping
them to work as slaves.
The natives kept retreating into the forests to escape the ‘slavers’
and, as time went on, there were hardly any native villages on the
coast; instead, there were large, well-laid-out European towns.
Plantation owners were then forced to turn to another source for slaves:
West Africa. This was a contrast to the Spanish colonies. A large part
of the population in the Aztec and Inca empires had been used to
labouring in mines and fields, so the Spanish did not need to formally
enslave them or to look elsewhere for slaves.
In 1549, a formal government under the Portuguese king
was established, with the capital in Bahia/Salvador. From this
time, Jesuits started to go out to Brazil. European settlers
disliked them because they argued for humane interaction with
the natives, ventured into the forests to live in villages, and
sought to teach them Christianity as a joyous religion. Above
all, the Jesuits strongly criticised slavery.
Conquest, Colonies and the Slave-Trade
What had begun as uncertain voyages came to have lasting
consequences for Europe, the Americas and Africa.
From the fifteenth century, European maritime projects
produced knowledge of continuous sea passages from ocean to
ocean. Before this, most of these passages had been unknown
to Europeans. Some were not known to anyone. No ship had
penetrated the Caribbean or the Americas. The South Atlantic
was wholly unexplored; no sea-going ship had ever entered its
waters, much less crossed it, or sailed from it to the Pacific or
the Indian Ocean. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries, all these feats were accomplished.

curse on a home or
family than to be

182  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
For Europe, the ‘discovery’ of the Americas had consequences for
others besides the initial voyagers. The influx of gold and silver helped
further expansion of international trade and industrialisation. Between
1560 and 1600, a hundred ships each year carried silver from South
American mines to Spain. But it was not
Spain and Portugal that benefited. They did
not invest their huge income in further trade,
or in building up a merchant navy. Instead,
it was the countries bordering the Atlantic,
particularly England, France, Belgium and
Holland, that took advantage of the
‘discoveries’. Their merchants formed joint-
stock companies and sent out trading
expeditions, established colonies and
introduced Europeans to the products of the
New World, including tobacco, potatoes, cane-
sugar, cacao and rubber.
Europe also became familiar with new
crops from America, notably potatoes and
chillies. These were then taken by Europeans
to other countries like India.
For the native people of the Americas, the
immediate consequences were the physical
decimation of local populations, the
destruction of their way of life and their
enslavement in mines, plantations and mills.
Estimates indicate that pre-conquest
Mexico had a population of between 30 and
37.5 million, the Andean region a similar
number while Central America had between
10 and 13 million. The natives on the eve of the arrival of the
Europeans totalled 70 million. A century and a half later, they had
reduced to 3.5 million. Warfare and disease were primarily
responsible for this.
The sudden destruction of the two major civilisations – those of the
Aztecs and the Incas – in America highlights the contrasts between the
two cultures in combat. Both with the Aztecs and the Incas, the nature
of warfare played a crucial role in terrorising local inhabitants
psychologically and physically. The contest also revealed a fundamental
difference in values. The Spanish avarice for gold and silver was
incomprehensible to the natives.
The enslavement of the population was a sharp reminder of the
brutality of the encounter. Slavery was not a new idea, but the
South American experience was new in that it accompanied the
emerging capitalist system of production. Working conditions were
horrific, but the Spanish regarded the exploitation as essential to
their economic gain.

The silver mines in Peru began to function in the 1550s, and the
monk Dominigo de Santo Tomas reported to the Council of the Indies
that the Potosi was a mouth of hell which swallowed Indians by
the thousands every year and that greedy mine owners treated them
like stray animals.
In 1601, Philip II of Spain publicly banned forced labour, but made
arrangements by a secret decree for its continuation. Things came to
a head with the law of 1609, which gave full freedom to the local
people, Christian and non-Christian alike. The European settlers were
enraged, and within two years they had forced the king to revoke this
law and to permit enslavement once again.
As new economic activities began – cattle farming on lands cleared
of forests, and mining after the discovery of gold in 1700 – the
demand for cheap labour continued. It was clear that the local people
would resist enslavement. The alternative was to turn to Africa.
Between the 1550s and 1880s (when slavery was abolished in Brazil)
over 3,600,000 African slaves were imported into Brazil. This was
almost half the total number of African slaves imported into the
Americas. In 1750, there were individuals who owned as many as a
thousand slaves.
From the early debates in the
1780s on abolishing slavery, there
were those who argued that slavery
existed in Africa prior to the entry of
the Europeans, indeed slaves formed
the bulk of the labour-force in the
states being formed in Africa from the
fifteenth century. They also pointed
out that European traders were
helped by Africans who helped capture
young men and women to be sold as
slaves, in return for crops imported
from South America (maize, manioc
and cassava, which became their
staple foods). In his autobiography
(1789), the freed slave Olaudah
Equiano replied to these arguments
by saying that slaves in Africa were
treated as part of the family. In the
1940s, in his book Capitalism and
Slavery, Eric Williams was one of the
first modern historians to initiate a
reassessment of the suffering
experienced by African slaves.

In the early nineteenth century, European settlers in the South
American colonies were to rebel against Spain and Portugal and become
independent countries, just as in 1776 the thirteen North American
colonies rebelled against Britain and formed the United States of
America.
South America today is also called ‘Latin America’. This is because
Spanish and Portuguese, two of the main languages of the continent,
are part of the Latin family of languages. The inhabitants are mostly
native European (called Creole), European, and African by origin. Most
of them are Catholics. Their culture has many elements of native
traditions mixed with European ones.

186  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
TOWARDS Modernisation
N the previous section you have read about certain crucial developments
in the medieval and early modern world – feudalism, the European
‘Renaissance’ and the encounters between Europeans and the peoples
of the Americas. As you would have realised, some of the phenomena that
contributed to the making of our modern world gradually evolved in this
period, and especially so from the mid-fifteenth century onwards. Two
further developments in world history created a context for what has
been called ‘modernisation’. These were the Industrial Revolution and a
series of political revolutions that transformed subjects into citizens,
beginning with the American Revolution (1776-81) and the French
Revolution (1789-94).
Britain has been the world’s first industrial nation and you will read
about how this came to be in Theme 9. For long it was believed that
British industrialisation provided the model for industrialisation in other
countries. The discussion of Theme 9 will show how historians have
begun to question some of the earlier ideas about the Industrial
Revolution. Each country drew upon the experiences of other nations,
without necessarily reproducing any model. In Britain, for instance,
coal and cotton textile industries were developed in the first phase of
industrialisation, while the invention of railways initiated the second
stage of that process. In other countries such as Russia, which began to
industrialise much later (from the late nineteenth century onwards),
the railway and other heavy industry emerged in the initial phase of
industrialisation itself. Likewise, the role of the state, and of banks, in
industrialisation has differed from country to country. The treatment of
the British case in Theme 9 will hopefully whet your curiosity about the
industrial trajectories of other nations such as the USA and Germany,
two significant industrial powers. Theme 9 also emphasises the human
and material costs incurred by Britain on its industrialisation – the
plight of the labouring poor, especially of children, environmental
degradation and the consequent epidemics of cholera and tuberculosis.

In Theme 11 you will similarly read about industrial pollution and
cadmium and mercury poisoning in Japan that stirred people into mass
movements against indiscriminate industrialisation.
European powers began to colonise parts of America and Asia and
South Africa well before the Industrial Revolution. Theme 10 tells you
the story of what European settlers did to the native peoples of America
and Australia. The bourgeois mentality of the settlers made them buy
and sell everything, including land and water. But the natives, who
appeared uncivilised to European Americans, asked, ‘If you do not
own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can one
buy them?’ The natives did not feel the need to own land, fish or
animals. They had no desire to commodify them; if things needed to be
exchanged, they could simply be gifted. Quite obviously, the natives
and the Europeans represented competing notions of civilisation. The
former did not allow the European deluge to wipe out their cultures
although the US and Canadian governments of the mid-twentieth
century desired natives to ‘join the mainstream’ and the Australian
authorities of the same period attempted to simply ignore their
traditions and culture. One might wonder what is meant by
‘mainstream’. How does economic and political power influence the
making of ‘mainstream cultures’?
Western capitalisms – mercantile, industrial and financial – and
early-twentieth-century Japanese capitalism created colonies in large
parts of the third world. Some of these were settler colonies. Others,
such as British rule in India, are examples of direct imperial control.
The case of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century China illustrates
a third variant of imperialism. Here Britain, France, Germany, Russia,
America and Japan meddled in Chinese affairs without directly taking
over state power. They exploited the country’s resources to their own
advantage, seriously compromising Chinese sovereignty and reducing
the country to the status of a semi-colony.
Almost everywhere, colonial exploitation was challenged by powerful
nationalist movements. Nationalisms, however, also arose without a
colonial context, as in the West or Japan. All nationalisms are doctrines
of popular sovereignty. Nationalist movements believe that political
power should rest with the people and this is what makes nationalism
a modern concept. Civic nationalism vests sovereignty in all people
regardless of language, ethnicity, religion or gender. It seeks to create
a community of rights-exercising citizens and defines nationhood in
terms of citizenship, not ethnicity or religion. Ethnic and religious
nationalisms try to build national solidarities around a given language,
religion or set of traditions, defining the people ethnically, not in terms
of common citizenship. In a multi-ethnic country, ethnic nationalists
might limit the exercise of sovereignty to a chosen people, often assumed
to be superior to minority communities. Today, most western countries
define their nationhood in terms of common citizenship and not by
common ethnicity. One prominent exception is Germany where ideas

of ethnic nationalism have had a long and troubling career going back
to the reaction against the French imperial occupation of German
states in 1806. Ideologies of civic nationalism have vied with those of
ethnic/religious nationalism the world over and this has been so in
modern India, China and Japan as well.
As with industrialisation, so with paths to modernisation. Different
societies have evolved their distinctive modernities. The Japanese and
Chinese cases are very instructive in this regard. Japan succeeded in
remaining free of colonial control and achieved fairly rapid economic
and industrial progress throughout the twentieth century. The rebuilding
of the Japanese economy after a humiliating defeat in the Second World
War should not be seen as a mere post-war miracle. As Theme 11 shows,
it resulted from certain gains that had already been accomplished in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Did you know, for instance,
that by 1910 tuition fees for studying at a primary school had more or
less ended and enrolment had become universal? The Japanese path to
modernisation nevertheless, like that of any other country, has had its
own tensions: those between democracy and militarism, ethnic
nationalism and civic nation-building and between what many Japanese
describe as ‘tradition’ and ‘westernisation’.
The Chinese resisted colonial exploitation and their own bureaucratic
landed elite through a combination of peasant rebellion, reform and
revolution. By the early 1930s, the Chinese Communist Party, which
drew its strength from peasant mobilisation, had begun confronting the
imperial powers as well as the Nationalists who represented the country’s
elite. They had also started to implement their ideas in selected pockets of
the country. Their egalitarian ideology, stress on land reforms and
awareness of women’s problems helped them overthrow foreign imperialism
and the Nationalists in 1949. Once in power, they succeeded in reducing
inequalities, spreading education and creating political awareness. Even
so, the country’s single-party framework and state repression contributed
to considerable dissatisfaction with the political system after the mid-
1960s. But the Communist Party has been able to retain control over the
country largely because, in embracing certain market principles, it
reinvented itself and has worked hard to transform China into an economic
powerhouse.
The different ways in which various countries have understood
‘modernity’ and sought to achieve it, each in the context of its own
circumstances and ideas, make a fascinating story. This section
introduces you to some aspects of that story.

The Industrial
Revolution
THE transformation of industry and the economy in Britain
between the 1780s and the 1850s is called the ‘first
industrial revolution’*. This had far-reaching effects in Britain.
Later, similar changes occurred in European countries and
in the USA. These were to have a major impact on the society
and economy of those countries and also on the rest of the
world.
This phase of industrial development in Britain is strongly
associated with new machinery and technologies. These
made it possible to produce goods on a massive scale
compared to handicraft and handloom industries. The chapter
outlines the changes in the cotton and iron industries. Steam,
a new source of power, began to be used on a wide scale in
British industries. Its use led to faster forms of transportation,
by ships and railways. Many of the inventors and
businessmen who brought about these changes were often
neither personally wealthy nor educated in basic sciences
like physics or chemistry, as will be seen from glances into
the backgrounds of some of them.
Industrialisation led to greater prosperity for some, but in
the initial stages it was linked with poor living and working
conditions of millions of people, including women and
children. This sparked off protests, which forced the
government to enact laws for regulating conditions of work.
The term ‘Industrial Revolution’ was used by European
scholars – Georges Michelet in France and Friedrich Engels
in Germany. It was used for the first time in English by the
philosopher and economist Arnold Toynbee (1852-83), to
describe the changes that occurred in British industrial
development between 1760 and 1820. These dates coincided
with those of the reign of George III, on which Toynbee was
giving a series of lectures at Oxford University. His lectures
were published in 1884, after his untimely death, as a book
called Lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England:
Popular Addresses, Notes and Other Fragments.
Later historians, T.S. Ashton, Paul Mantoux and Eric
Hobsbawm, broadly agreed with Toynbee. There was
remarkable economic growth from the 1780s to 1820 in the
cotton and iron industries, in coal mining, in the building of
roads and canals and in foreign trade. Ashton (1889-1968)
celebrated the Industrial Revolution, when England was
‘swept by a wave of gadgets’.

after about 1850,

Why Britain?
Britain was the first country to experience modern industrialisation. It
had been politically stable since the seventeenth century, with England,
Wales and Scotland unified under a monarchy. This meant that the
kingdom had common laws, a single currency and a market that was
not fragmented by local authorities levying taxes on goods that passed
through their area, thus increasing their price. By the end of the
seventeenth century, money was widely used as the medium of
exchange. By then a large section of the people received their income
in the form of wages and salaries rather than in goods. This gave
people a wider choice for ways to spend their earnings and expanded
the market for the sale of goods.
In the eighteenth century, England had been through a major
economic change, later described as the ‘agricultural revolution’. This
was the process by which bigger landlords had bought up small farms
near their own properties and enclosed the village common lands, thus
creating very large estates and increasing food production.
This forced landless farmers, and those who had lived by
grazing animals on the common lands, to search for jobs
elsewhere. Most of them went to nearby towns.
Towns, Trade and Finance
From the eighteenth century, many towns in Europe were
growing in area and in population. Out of the 19 European
cities whose population doubled between 1750 and 1800, 11
were in Britain. The largest of them was London, which served
as the hub of the country’s markets, with the next largest
ones located close to it.
London had also acquired a global significance. By the
eighteenth century, the centre of global trade had shifted
from the Mediterranean ports of Italy and France to the
Atlantic ports of Holland and Britain. Still later, London
replaced Amsterdam as the principal source of loans for
international trade. London also became the centre of a
triangular trade network that drew in England, Africa and
the West Indies. The companies trading in America and Asia
also had their offices in London. In England the movement of goods
between markets was helped by a good network of rivers, and an indented
coastline with sheltered bays. Until the spread of railways, transport by
waterways was cheaper and faster than by land. As early as 1724, English
rivers provided some 1,160 miles of navigable water, and except for
mountainous areas, most places in the country were within 15 miles of a
river. Since all the navigable sections of English rivers flow into the sea,
cargo on river vessels was easily transferred to coastal ships called coasters.
By 1800, at least 100,000 sailors worked on the coasters.

neighbouring fields of half
their growth.’

198  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The centre of the country’s financial system was the Bank of England
(founded in 1694). By 1784, there were more than a hundred provincial
banks in England, and during the next 10 years their numbers trebled.
By the 1820s, there were more than 600 banks in the provinces, and over
100 banks in London alone. The financial requirements to establish and
maintain big industrial enterprises were met by these banks.
The industrialisation that occurred in Britain from the 1780s to the
1850s is explained partly by the factors described above – many poor
people from the villages available to work in towns; banks which could
loan money to set up large industries; and a good transport network.
The following pages will describe two new factors: a range of technological
changes that increased production levels dramatically and a new transport
network created by the construction of railways. In both developments, if
the dates are read carefully, one will notice that there is a gap of a few
decades between the development and its widespread application. One
must not assume that a new innovation in technology led to it being used
in the industry immediately.
Of the 26,000 inventions recorded in the eighteenth century, more
than half were listed for the period 1782-1800. These led to many changes.
We shall discuss the four major ones: the transformation of the iron
industry, the spinning and weaving of cotton, the development of steam
‘power’ and the coming of the railways.
Coal and Iron
England was fortunate in that coal and iron ore, the staple materials for
mechanisation, were plentifully available, as were other minerals – lead,
copper and tin – that were used in industry. However, until the eighteenth
century, there was a scarcity of usable iron. Iron is drawn out from ore as
pure liquid metal by a process called smelting. For centuries, charcoal
(from burnt timber) was used for the smelting process. This had several
problems: charcoal was too fragile to transport across long distances; its
impurities produced poor-quality iron; it was in short supply because

forests had been destroyed for timber; and it could
not generate high temperatures.
The solution to this problem had been sought
for years before it was solved by a family of
iron-masters, the Darbys of Shropshire. In the
course of half a century, three generations of
this family – grandfather, father and son, all
called Abraham Darby – brought about a
revolution in the metallurgical industry. It
began with an invention in 1709 by the first
Abraham Darby (1677-1717). This was a blast
furnace that would use coke, which could
generate high temperatures; coke was derived
from coal by removing the sulphur and impurities. This invention
meant that furnaces no longer had to depend on charcoal. The melted
iron that emerged from these furnaces permitted finer and larger
castings than before.
The process was further refined by more inventions. The second
Darby (1711-68) developed wrought-iron (which was less brittle) from
pig-iron. Henry Cort (1740-1823) designed the puddling furnace (in
which molten iron could be rid of impurities) and the rolling mill,
which used steam power to roll purified iron into bars. It now became
possible to produce a broader range of iron products. The durability of
iron made it a better material than wood for
everyday items and for machinery. Unlike
wood, which could burn or splinter, the
physical and chemical properties of iron could
be controlled. In the 1770s, John Wilkinson
(1728-1808) made the first iron chairs, vats
for breweries and distilleries, and iron pipes
of all sizes. In 1779, the third Darby (1750-
91) built the first iron bridge in the world, in
Coalbrookdale, spanning the river Severn*.
Wilkinson used cast iron for the first time to
make water pipes (40 miles of it for the water
supply of Paris).
The iron industry then came to be
concentrated in specific regions as integrated
units of coal mining and iron smelting.
Britain was lucky in possessing excellent
coking coal and high-grade iron ore in the
same basins or even the same seams. These
basins were also close to ports; there were
five coastal coalfields which could deliver their
products almost straight into ships. Since the
coalfields were near the coast, shipbuilding
increased, as did the shipping trade.
*This area later
grew into the village
called Ironbridge.

200  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The British iron industry quadrupled its output between 1800 and
1830, and its product was the cheapest in Europe. In 1820, a ton of
pig iron needed 8 tons of coal to make it, but by 1850 it could be
produced by using only 2 tons. By 1848, Britain was smelting more
iron than the rest of the world put together.
Cotton Spinning and Weaving
The British had always woven cloth out of wool and flax (to make
linen). From the seventeenth century, the country had been importing
bales of cotton cloth from India at great cost. As the East India
Company’s political control of parts of India was established, it began
to import, along with cloth, raw cotton, which could be spun and
woven into cloth in England.
Till the early eighteenth century, spinning had been so slow and
laborious that 10 spinners (mostly women, hence the word ‘spinster’)
were required to supply sufficient yarn to keep a single weaver busy.
Therefore, while spinners were occupied all day, weavers waited idly to
receive yarn. But a series of technological inventions successfully closed
the gap between the speed in spinning raw cotton into yarn or thread,
and of weaving the yarn into fabric. To make it even more efficient,
production gradually shifted from the homes of spinners and weavers
to factories.
From the 1780s, the cotton industry symbolised British industrialisation
in many ways. This industry had two features which were also seen in
other industries.
Raw cotton had to be entirely imported and a large part of the
finished cloth was exported. This sustained the process of colonisation,

so that Britain could retain control
over the sources of raw cotton as well
as the markets.
The industry was heavily
dependent on the work of women  and
children in factories. This exemplified
the ugly face of early industrialisation,
as will be described below.
Steam Power
The realisation that steam could
generate tremendous power was
decisive to large-scale industrialisation.
1. The flying shuttle loom, designed by John Kay (1704-64) in
1733 made it possible to weave broader fabrics in less time and
consequently called for more yarn than could be supplied at the
prevailing pace of spinning.
2. The spinning jenny was a machine made by James Hargreaves
(1720-78) in 1765 on which a single person could spin several
threads of yarn simultaneously. This provided weavers with yarn
at a faster rate than they could weave into fabric.
3. The water frame, which Richard Arkwright (1732-92) invented
in 1769, produced a much stronger thread than before. This also
made it possible to weave pure cotton fabrics rather than fabrics
that combined linen and cotton yarn.
4. The mule was the nickname for a machine invented in 1779 by
Samuel Crompton (1753-1827) that allowed the spinning of strong
and fine yarn.
5. The cycle of inventions in the cotton textile industry that sought to
maintain a balance between the tasks of spinning and weaving
concluded with the invention of the
powerloom by Edmund Cartwright
(1743-1823) in 1787. This was easy
to work, stopped automatically every
time a thread broke and could be
used to weave any kind of material.
From the 1830s, developments in
this industry concentrated on
increasing the productivity of workers
rather than bringing new machines
into use.

202  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Water as hydraulic power had been the prime source of
energy for centuries, but it had been limited to certain areas,
seasons and by the speed of flow of the water. Now it was
used differently. Steam power provided pressure at high
temperatures that enabled the use of a broad range of
machinery. This meant that steam power was the only source
of energy that was reliable and inexpensive enough to
manufacture machinery itself.
Steam power was first used in mining industries. As
the demand for coal and metals expanded, efforts to
obtain them from ever-deeper mines intensified.
Flooding in mines was a serious problem. Thomas
Savery (1650-1715) built a model steam engine called
the Miner’s Friend in 1698 to drain mines. These
engines worked slowly, in shallow depths, and the boiler
burst under too much pressure.
Another steam engine was built by Thomas Newcomen
(1663-1729) in 1712. This had the major defect of losing
energy due to continuous cooling of the condensing cylinder.
The steam engine had been used only in coal mines
until James Watt (1736-1819) developed his machine in
1769. Watt’s invention converted the steam engine from
being a mere pump into a ‘prime mover’ capable of
providing energy to power machines in factories. Backed
by the wealthy manufacturer Matthew Boulton (1728-
1809), Watt created the Soho Foundry
in Birmingham in 1775. From this
foundry Watt’s steam engines were
produced in steadily growing numbers.
By the end of the eighteenth century,
Watt’s steam engine was beginning to
replace hydraulic power.
After 1800, steam engine technology
was further developed with the use of
lighter, stronger metals, the manufacture
of more accurate machine tools and the
spread of better scientific knowledge.  In
1840, British steam engines were
generating more than 70 per cent of all
European horsepower.
Watt’s inventions were
not limited to the steam
engine. He invented a
chemical process for
copying documents.
He also created a unit of
measurement based on
comparing mechanical
power with that of the
previous universal
power source, the horse.
Watt’s measurement
unit, horsepower,
equated the ability of a
horse to lift 33,000
pounds (14,969 kg)
one foot (0.3 m) in one
minute. Horsepower
remains universally used
as an index of
mechanical energy.
Horses turned the wheels to grind metal. The
use of steam reduced the dependence on
manpower and horsepower.

Canals and Railways
Canals were initially built to transport coal to cities.  This was because
the bulk and weight of coal made its transport by road much slower
and more expensive than by barges on canals. The demand for coal, as
industrial energy and for heating and lighting homes in cities, grew
constantly. The making of the first English canal, the Worsley Canal
(1761) by James Brindley (1716-72), had no other purpose than to
carry coal from the coal deposits at Worsley (near Manchester) to that
city; after the canal was completed the price of coal fell by half.
Canals were usually built by big landowners to increase the value of
the mines, quarries or forests on their lands. The confluence of canals
created marketing centres in new towns. The city of Birmingham, for
example, owed its growth to its position at the heart of a canal system
connecting London, the Bristol Channel, and the Mersey and Humber
rivers. From 1760 to 1790, twenty-five new canal-building projects
were begun. In the period known as the ‘canal-mania’, from 1788 to
1796, there were another 46 new projects and over the next 60 years
more than 4,000 miles of canal were built.
The first steam locomotive, Stephenson’s Rocket, appeared in
1814. Railways emerged as a new means of transportation that was
available throughout the year, both cheap and fast, to carry
passengers and goods. They combined two inventions, the iron track
which replaced the wooden track in the 1760s, and haulage along it
by steam engine.
The invention of the railways took the entire process of
industrialisation to a  second stage. In 1801, Richard Trevithick
(1771-1833) had devised an engine called the ‘Puffing Devil’ that pulled
trucks around the mine where he worked in Cornwall. In 1814, the
railway engineer George Stephenson (1781-1848) constructed a
locomotive, called ‘The Blutcher’, that could pull a weight of 30 tons up
a hill at 4 mph. The first railway line connected the cities of Stockton
and Darlington in 1825, a distance of 9 miles that was completed in
two hours at speeds of up to 24 kph (15 mph), and the next railway
line connected Liverpool and Manchester in 1830. Within 20 years,
speeds of 30 to 50 miles an hour were usual.
In the 1830s, the use of canals revealed several problems. The
congestion of vessels made movement slow on certain stretches of
canals, and frost, flood or drought limited the time of their use. The
railways now appeared as a convenient alternative. About 6,000
miles of railway was opened in Britain between 1830 and 1850,
most of it in two short bursts. During the ‘little railway mania’ of
1833-37, 1400 miles of line was built, and during the bigger ‘mania’
of 1844-47, another 9,500 miles of line was sanctioned. They used
vast amounts of coal and iron, employed large numbers of workers
and boosted activity in the construction and public works industries.
Most of England had been connected by railway by 1850.

Who were the inventors?
It is interesting to find out who the individuals were who brought about these
changes. Few of them were trained scientists. Education in basic sciences like
physics or chemistry was extremely limited until the late nineteenth century,
well after the technological inventions described above. Since these
breakthroughs did not require a full knowledge of the laws of physics or
chemistry on which they were based, advances could be and were made by
brilliant but intuitive thinkers and persistent experimenters. They were helped
by the fact that England had certain features which European countries did
not. Dozens of scientific journals and published papers of scientific societies
appeared in England between 1760 and 1800. There was a widespread thirst
for knowledge even in the smaller towns. This was met by the activities of the
Society of Arts (founded in 1754), by travelling lecturers, or in ‘coffee houses’
that multiplied through the eighteenth century.
Most inventions were more the product of determination, interest, curiosity,
even luck, than the application of scientific knowledge. Some inventors in the
cotton industry, like John Kay and James Hargreaves, were familiar with the
skills of weaving and carpentry. Richard Arkwright, however, was a barber
and wig-maker, Samuel Crompton was not technically skilled, and Edmund
Cartwright studied literature, medicine and agriculture, initially wished to
become a clergyman, and knew little of mechanics.
By contrast, in the area of steam engines, Thomas Savery, an army officer,
Thomas Newcomen, a blacksmith and locksmith, and James Watt, with a
strong mechanical bent, all had some knowledge relevant to their inventions.
The road-builder John Metcalf, who personally surveyed surfaces for roads
and planned them, was blind. The canal builder James Brindley was almost
illiterate, with such poor spelling that he could never spell the word ‘navigation’,
but he had tremendous powers of memory, imagination and concentration.
Changed lives
In these years, therefore, it was possible for individuals with talent to
bring about revolutionary changes. Similarly, there were rich individuals
who took risks and invested money in industries in the hope that profits
could be made, and that their money would ‘multiply’. In most cases this
money – capital – did multiply. Wealth, in the form of goods, incomes,
services, knowledge and productive efficiency, did increase dramatically.
There was, at the same time, a massive negative human cost. This was
evident in broken families, new addresses, degraded cities and appalling
working conditions in factories. The number of cities in England with a
population of over 50,000 grew from two in 1750 to 29 in 1850. This pace
of growth was not matched with the provision of adequate housing,
sanitation or clean water for the rapidly growing urban population.

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
Edward Carpenter eloquently described such cities in about 1881, in
his poem ‘In a Manufacturing Town’
‘As I walked restless and despondent through the gloomy city,
And saw the eager unresting to and fro – as of ghosts in some
sulphurous Hades* –
And saw the crowds of tall chimneys going up, and the pall of smoke
covering the sun, covering the earth, lying heavy against the very
ground –
And saw the huge-refuse heaps writhing with children picking them
over,
And the ghastly half-roofless smoke-blackened houses, and the black
river flowing below, –
As I saw these, and as I saw again faraway the Capitalist quarter,
With its villa residences and its high-walled gardens and its
well-appointed carriages, and its face turned away from the wriggling
poverty which made it rich, …
I shuddered.
The Workers
A survey in 1842 revealed that the average lifespan of workers was
lower than that of any other social group in cities: it was
15 years in Birmingham, 17 in Manchester, 21 in Derby. More people
died, and died at a younger age, in the new industrial cities, than in
the villages they had come from. Half the children failed to survive
beyond the age of five. The increase in the population of cities was
because of immigrants, rather than by an increase in the number of
children born to families who already lived there.
Deaths were primarily caused by epidemics of disease that sprang
from the pollution of water, like cholera and typhoid, or of the air,

like tuberculosis. More than 31,000 people died from an outbreak of
cholera in 1832. Until late in the nineteenth century, municipal
authorities were negligent in attending to these dangerous conditions
of life and the medical knowledge to understand and cure these
diseases was unknown.
Women, Children and Industrialisation
The Industrial Revolution was a time of important changes in the way
that children and women worked. Children of the rural poor had always
worked at home or in the farm at jobs that varied during the day or
between seasons, under the watchful eye of parents or relatives.
Likewise, in villages women were actively involved in farm work; they
reared livestock, gathered firewood and spun yarn on spinning wheels
in their homes.
Work in the factories, with long, unbroken hours of the same kind
of work, under strict discipline and sharp forms of punishment, was
completely different. The earnings of women and children were
necessary to supplement men’s meagre wages. As the use of machinery
spread, and fewer workers were needed, industrialists preferred to
employ women and children who would be less agitated about their
poor working conditions and work for lower wages than men.
They were employed in large numbers in the cotton textile industry in
Lancashire and Yorkshire. Women were also the main workers in the silk,

lace-making and knitting industries, as well as (along with children) in
the metal industries of Birmingham. Machinery like the cotton spinning
jenny was designed to be used by child workers with their small build and
nimble fingers. Children were often employed in textile factories because
they were small enough to move between tightly packed machinery. The
long hours of work, including cleaning the machines on Sundays, allowed
them little fresh air or exercise. Children caught their hair in machines or
crushed their hands, while some died when they fell into machines as
they dropped off to sleep from exhaustion.
Coal mines were also dangerous places to work in. Roofs caved in
or there could be an explosion, and injuries were therefore common.
The owners of coal mines used children to reach deep coal faces or
those where the approach path was too narrow for adults. Younger
children worked as ‘trappers’ who opened and shut doors as the coal
wagons travelled through mines, or carried heavy loads of coal on
their backs as ‘coal bearers.’
Factory managers considered child labour to be important training
for future factory work. The evidence from British factory
records reveals that about half of the factory workers
had started work when they were less than ten years old
and 28 per cent when they were under 14. Women may
well have gained increased financial independence and
self-esteem from their jobs; but this was more than offset
by the humiliating terms of work they endured, the
children they lost at birth or in early childhood and the
squalid urban slums that industrial work compelled them
to live in.
In his novel Hard Times, Charles Dickens (1812-70),
perhaps the most severe contemporary critic of the
horrors of industrialisation for the poor, wrote a fictional
account of an industrial town he aptly called Coketown.
‘It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have
been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as
matters stood it was a town of unnatural red and black
like the painted face of a savage. It was a town of
machinery and tall chimneys, out of which
interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for
ever and ever, and never got uncoiled. It had a black
canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling
dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where
there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and
where the piston of the steam-engine worked
monotonously up and down, like the head of an
elephant in a stare of melancholy madness.’

D.H.Lawrence (1885-1930), British essayist and novelist, writing
seventy years after Dickens, described the change in a village in
the coal-belt, change which he had not experienced, but about which
he had heard from older people.
‘Eastwood…must have been a tiny village at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, a small place of cottages and fragmentary rows
of little four-roomed miners’ dwellings, the homes of the old
colliers…But somewhere about 1820 the company must have sunk
the first big shaft…and installed the first machinery of the real
industrial colliery…Most of the little rows of dwellings were pulled
down, and dull little shops began to rise along the Nottingham
Road, while on the down-slope…the company erected what is still
known as the New Buildings…little four-room houses looking
outward into the grim, blank street, and the back looking into the
desert of the square, shut in like a barracks enclosure, very strange’.
Protest Movements
The early decades of industrialisation coincided with the spread of new
political ideas pioneered by the French Revolution (1789-94). The
movements for ‘liberty, equality and fraternity’ showed the possibilities
of collective mass action, both in creating democratic institutions like
the French parliamentary assemblies of the 1790s, and in checking
the worst hardships of war by controlling the prices of necessities like
bread. In England, political protest against the harsh working
conditions in factories kept increasing, and the working population
agitated to be given the right to vote. The government reacted by
repression and by new laws that denied people the right to protest.
England had been at war with France for a long time – from 1792
to 1815. Trade between England and Europe was disrupted, factories
were forced to shut down, unemployment grew and the price of essential
items of food, like bread and meat, soared to heights beyond the level
of average wages.
Parliament in 1795 passed two Combination Acts which made it
illegal to ‘incite the people by speech or writing to hatred or contempt
of the King, Constitution or Government’; and banned unauthorised
public meetings of over 50 persons. Protest, nonetheless, continued
against ‘Old Corruption’. This term was used for privileges linked to
the monarchy and Parliament. Members of Parliament – landowners,
manufacturers and professionals – were opposed to giving the working
population the right to vote. They supported the Corn Laws, which
prevented the import of cheaper food until prices in Britain had risen
to a certain level.
As workers flooded towns and factories, they expressed their anger
and frustration in numerous forms of protest. There were bread or

food riots throughout the country from the 1790s onwards. Bread
was the staple item in the diet of the poor and its price governed
their standard of living. Stocks of bread were seized and sold at a
price that was affordable and morally correct rather than at the
high prices charged by profit-hungry traders. Such riots were
particularly frequent in the worst year of the war,1795, but they
continued until the 1840s.
Another cause of hardship was the process known as ‘enclosure’ –
by which, from the 1770s, hundreds of small farms had been merged
into the larger ones of powerful landlords. Poor rural families affected
by this had sought industrial work. But the introduction of machines
in the cotton industry threw thousands of handloom weavers out of
work and into poverty, since their labour was too slow to compete with
machines. From the 1790s, these weavers began to demand a legal
minimum wage, which was refused by Parliament. When they went on
strike, they were dispersed by force. In desperation, in Lancashire,
cotton weavers destroyed the powerlooms which they believed had
destroyed their livelihood. There was also resistance to the introduction
of machines in the woollen knitting industry in Nottingham; protests
also took place in Leicestershire and Derbyshire.
In Yorkshire, shearing-frames were destroyed by croppers, who had
traditionally sheared sheep by hand. In the riots of 1830, farm labourers
found their jobs threatened by the new threshing machines that
separated the grain from the husk. The rioters smashed these
machines. Nine of them were hanged and 450 were sent to Australia
as convicts (see Theme 10).
The movement known as Luddism (1811-17), led by the charismatic
General Ned Ludd, exemplified another type of protest. Luddism was
not merely a backward-looking assault on machines. Its participants
demanded a minimum wage, control over the labour of women and
children, work for those who had lost their jobs because of the coming
of machinery, and the right to form trade unions so that they could
legally present these demands.
During the early years of industrialisation, the working population
possessed neither the vote nor legal methods to express their anger at
the drastic manner in which their lives had been overturned. In August
1819, 80,000 people gathered peacefully at St Peter’s Fields in
Manchester to claim democratic rights – of political organisation, of
public meetings, and of the freedom of the press. They were suppressed
brutally in what became known as the Peterloo* Massacre and the
rights they demanded were denied by the Six Acts, passed by Parliament
the same year. These extended the restrictions on political activity
introduced in the two Combination Acts of 1795. But there were some
gains. After Peterloo, the need to make the House of Commons more
representative was recognised by liberal political groups, and the
Combination Acts were repealed in 1824-25.

Reforms through Laws
How attentive was the government to the conditions of work of women
and children? Laws were passed in 1819 prohibiting the employment
of children under the age of nine in  factories and limiting the hours of
work of those between the ages of nine and sixteen to 12 hours a day.
But this law lacked the powers needed for its enforcement. It was not
until 1833, after intense protest by workers throughout the north of
England, that an Act was passed that permitted children under nine
to be employed only in silk factories, limited the hours of work for
older children and provided a number of factory inspectors to ensure
that the Act was enforced. Finally, in 1847, after more than 30 years
of agitation, the Ten Hours’ Bill was passed. This limited the hours of
work for women and young people, and secured a 10-hour day for
male workers.
These Acts applied to the textile industries but not to the mining
industry. The Mines Commission of 1842, set up by the government,
revealed that working conditions in mines had actually become worse
since the Act of 1833, because more children had been put to work in
coal mines. The Mines and Collieries Act of 1842 banned children
under ten and women from working underground. Fielder’s Factory
Act laid down in 1847 that children under eighteen and women should
not work more than 10 hours a day. These laws were to be enforced by
factory inspectors, but this was difficult to do. The inspectors were
poorly paid and easily bribed by factory managers, while parents lied
about the real ages of their children, so that they could work and
contribute to family incomes.
The Debate on the ‘Industrial Revolution’
Until the 1970s, historians used the term ‘industrial revolution’ for
the changes that occurred in Britain from the 1780s to the 1820s.
From then, it was challenged, on various grounds.
Industrialisation had actually been too gradual to be considered a
‘revolution’. It carried processes that already existed towards new levels.
Thus, there was a relatively greater concentration of workers in factories,
and a wider use of money.
Until well into the nineteenth century, large regions of England
remained untouched by factories or mines and therefore the term
‘industrial revolution’ was regarded as inaccurate: England had
changed in a regional manner, prominently around the cities of
London, Manchester, Birmingham or Newcastle, rather than
throughout the country.
Could the growth in the cotton or iron industries or in foreign trade
from the 1780s to the 1820s be called revolutionary? The impressive
growth of cotton textiles, based on new machinery, was in an industry
that relied on a non-British raw material, on sales abroad (especially

India), on non-metallic machinery, and with few links to other branches
of industry. Metallic machinery and steam power was rare until much
later in the nineteenth century. The rapid growth in British imports
and exports from the 1780s occurred because of the resumption of
trade with North America that the War of American Independence had
interrupted. This growth was recorded as being sharp only because it
started from a low point.
Indicators of economic change occurring before and after 1815-20
suggest that sustained industrialisation was to be seen after rather
than before these dates. The decades after 1793 had experienced the
disruptive effects of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
Industrialisation is associated with a growing investment of the
country’s wealth in ‘capital formation’, or building infrastructure and
installing new machinery, and with raising the levels of efficient use of
these facilities, and with raising productivity. Productive investment,
in these senses, grew steadily only after 1820, as did levels of
productivity. The cotton, iron and engineering industries had accounted
for less than half of the industrial output until the 1840s. Technical
progress was not limited to these branches, but was visible in other
branches too, like agricultural processing and pottery.
In searching for an answer as to why British growth may have been
faster after 1815 than before, historians have pointed to the fact that
from the 1760s to 1815, Britain tried to do two things simultaneously
– to industrialise, and to fight wars in Europe, North America and
India - and it may possibly have failed with one. Britain was at war for
36 out of 60 years from 1760. Capital that was borrowed was used to
fight the wars rather than invested. As much as 35 per cent of the cost
of the war was met by taxing people’s incomes. Workers were transferred
out of factories and farms to the army. Food prices rose so sharply
that the poor had little money left for buying consumer goods.
Napoleon’s policies of blockade, and British reactions to them, closed
the European continent, the destination for more than half of British
exports, to British traders.
The word ‘industrial’ used with the word ‘revolution’ is too limited.
The transformation extended beyond the economic or industrial sphere
and into society and gave prominence to two classes:  the bourgeoisie
and the new class of proletarian labourers in towns and in the countryside.
In 1851, visitors thronged the Great Exhibition at the specially
constructed Crystal Palace in London to view the achievements of British
industry.  At that time, half the population was living in towns, but of
the workers in towns as many were in handicraft units as in factories.
From the 1850s, the proportion of people living in urban areas went
up dramatically, and most of these were workers in industry – the
working class. Only 20 per cent of Britain’s workforce now lived in
rural areas. This was a far more rapid rate of industrialisation than
had been witnessed in other European countries. In his detailed study
of British industry, the historian A.E. Musson has suggested that

Displacing Indigenous
Peoples
THIS chapter recounts some aspects of the histories of the
native peoples of America and Australia. Theme 8 described
the history of the Spanish and Portuguese colonisation of
South America. From the eighteenth century, more areas
of South America, Central America, North America, South
Africa, Australia and New Zealand came to be settled by
immigrants from Europe. This led to many of the native
peoples being pushed out into other areas. The European
settlements were called ‘colonies’. When the European
inhabitants of the colonies became independent of the
European ‘mother-country’, these colonies became ‘states’
or countries.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, people from
Asian countries also migrated to some of these countries.
Today, these Europeans and Asians form the majority in
these countries, and the number of the native inhabitants
are very small. They are hardly seen in the towns, and
people have forgotten that they once occupied much of the
country, and that the names of many rivers, towns, etc.
are derived from ‘native’ names (e.g. Ohio, Mississippi and
Seattle in the USA, Saskatchewan in Canada, Wollongong
and Parramatta in Australia).
Till the middle of the twentieth century, American and
Australian history textbooks used to describe how
Europeans ‘discovered’ the Americas and Australia. They
hardly mentioned the native peoples except to suggest that
they were hostile to Europeans. These peoples were,
however, studied by anthropologists in America from the
1840s. Much later, from the 1960s, the native peoples were
encouraged to write their own histories or to dictate them
(this is called oral history).
Today, it is possible to read historical works and fiction
written by the native peoples, and visitors to museums in
these countries will see galleries of ‘native art’ and special
museums which show the aboriginal way of life. The new
National Museum of the American Indian in the USA has
been curated by American Indians themselves.

European Imperialism
The American empires of Spain and Portugal (see Theme 8) did not
expand after the seventeenth century. From that time other countries
– France, Holland and England – began to extend their trading
activities and to establish colonies – in America, Africa and Asia;
Ireland also was virtually a colony of England, as the landowners
there were mostly English settlers.
From the eighteenth century, it became obvious that while it was
the prospect of profit which drove people to establish colonies, there
were significant variations in the nature of the control established.
In South Asia, trading companies like the East India Company
made themselves into political powers, defeated local rulers and
annexed their territories. They retained the older well-developed
administrative system and collected taxes from landowners. Later
they built railways to make trade easier, excavated mines and
established big plantations.
In Africa, Europeans traded on the coast, except in South Africa,
and only in the late nineteenth century did they venture into the
interior. After this, some of the European countries reached an
agreement to divide up Africa as colonies for themselves.
The word ‘settler’ is used for the Dutch in South Africa, the British
in Ireland, New Zealand and Australia, and the Europeans in America.
The official language in these colonies was English (except in Canada,
where French is also an official language).

NORTH AMERICA
The continent of North America extends from the Arctic Circle to the
Tropic of Cancer, from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. West of the
chain of the Rocky Mountains is the desert of Arizona and Nevada, still
further west the Sierra Nevada mountains, to the east the Great Plains,
the Great Lakes, the valleys of the Mississippi and the Ohio and the
Appalachian Mountains. To the south is Mexico. Forty per cent of
Canada is covered with forests. Oil, gas and mineral resources are
found in many areas, which explains the many big industries in the
USA and Canada. Today, wheat, corn and fruit are grown extensively
and fishing is a major industry in Canada.
Mining, industry and extensive agriculture have been developed only
in the last 200 years by immigrants from Europe, Africa and China. But
there were people who had been living in North America for thousands of
years before the Europeans learnt of its existence.
The Native Peoples
The earliest inhabitants of North America came from Asia over 30,000
years ago on a land-bridge across the Bering Straits, and during the
last Ice Age 10,000 years ago they moved further south. The oldest
artefact found in America – an arrow-point – is 11,000 years old. The
population started to increase about 5,000 years ago when the climate
became more stable.
‘At sunset on the day before America [that is, before the Europeans
reached there and gave the continent this name], diversity lay at
every hand. People spoke in more than a hundred tongues. They
lived by every possible combination of hunting, fishing, gathering,
gardening, and farming open to them. The quality of soils and the
effort required to open and tend them determined some of their
choices of how to live. Cultural and social biases determined others.
Surpluses of fish or grain or garden plants or meats helped create
powerful, tiered societies here but not there. Some cultures had
endured for millennia…’ – William Macleish, The Day before America.
These peoples lived in bands, in villages along river valleys. They ate
fish and meat, and cultivated vegetables and maize. They often went
on long journeys in search of meat, chiefly that of bison, the wild
buffalo that roamed the grasslands (this became easier from the
seventeenth century, when the natives started to ride horses, which
they bought from Spanish settlers). But they only killed as many
animals as they needed for food.

– From a talk by Lee Brown, 1986
In the seventeenth century, the European traders who reached the
north coast of North America after a difficult two-month voyage were
relieved to find the native peoples friendly and welcoming. Unlike the
Spanish in South America, who were overcome by the abundance of
gold in the country, these adventurers came to trade in fish and furs, in
which they got the willing help of the natives who were expert at hunting.
Further south, along the Mississippi river, the French found that
the natives held regular gatherings to exchange handicrafts unique to
a tribe or food items not available in other regions. In exchange for
local products the Europeans gave the natives blankets, iron vessels
(which they used sometimes in place of their clay pots), guns, which
was a useful supplement for bows and arrows to kill animals, and
alcohol. This last item was something the natives had not known earlier,
and they became addicted to it, which suited the Europeans, because
it enabled them to dictate terms of trade. (The Europeans acquired
from the natives an addiction to tobacco.)

218  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Mutual Perceptions
In the eighteenth century, western Europeans defined ‘civilised’ people
in terms of literacy, an organised religion and urbanism. To them, the
natives of America appeared ‘uncivilised’. To some, like the French
philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, such people were to be admired,
as they were untouched by the corruptions of ‘civilisation’. A popular
term was ‘the noble savage’. Some lines in a poem by the English poet
William Wordsworth indicate another perspective. Neither he nor
Rousseau had met a native American, but Wordsworth described them
as living ‘amid wilds/Where fancy hath small liberty to grace/The
affections, to exalt them or refine’, meaning that people living close to
nature had only limited powers of imagination and emotion!
It is interesting to note that another writer, Washington Irving, much
younger than Wordsworth and who had actually met native people,
described them quite differently.
‘The Indians I have had an opportunity of seeing in real life are
quite different from those described in poetry… Taciturn they are, it
is true, when in company with white men, whose goodwill they
distrust and whose language they do not understand; but the white
man is equally taciturn under like circumstances. When the Indians
are among themselves, they are great mimics, and entertain
themselves excessively at the expense of the whites… who have
supposed them impressed with profound respect for their grandeur
and dignity… The white men (as I have witnessed) are prone to
treat the poor Indians as little better than animals’.
To the natives, the goods they exchanged with the Europeans were
gifts, given in friendship. For the Europeans, dreaming of becoming rich,
the fish and furs were commodities, which they would sell for a profit in
Europe. The prices of the goods they sold varied from year to year,
depending on the supply. The natives could not understand this – they
had no sense of the ‘market’ in faraway Europe. They were puzzled by the
fact that the European traders sometimes gave them a lot of things in
exchange for their goods, sometimes very little. They were also saddened
by the greed of the Europeans*. In their impatience to get furs, they had
slaughtered hundreds of beavers, and the natives were very uneasy, fearing
that the animals would take revenge on them for this destruction.
Following the first Europeans, who were traders, were those who
came to ‘settle’ in America. From the seventeenth century, there
were groups of Europeans who were being persecuted because they
were of a different sect of Christianity (Protestants living in
predominantly Catholic countries, or Catholics in countries where
Protestantism was the official religion). Many of them left Europe
and went to America to begin a new life. As long as there was vacant

land, this was not a problem, but gradually the Europeans moved
further inland, near native villages. They used their iron tools to cut
down forests to lay out farms.
Natives and Europeans saw different things when they looked at
forests – natives identified tracks invisible to the Europeans. Europeans
imagined the forests cut down and replaced by cornfields. Jefferson’s
‘dream’ was a country populated by Europeans with small farms. The
natives, who grew crops for their own needs, not for sale and profit,
and thought it wrong to ‘own’ the land, could not understand this. In
Jefferson’s view, this made them ‘uncivilised’.

220  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
The countries that are known as Canada and the United States of
America came into existence at the end of the eighteenth century. At
that time they occupied only a fraction of the land they now cover.
Over the next hundred years they extended their control over more
territory, to reach their present size. Large areas were acquired by the
USA by purchase – they bought land in the south from France (the
‘Louisiana Purchase’) and from Russia (Alaska), and by war – much of
southern USA was won from Mexico. It did not occur to anyone that
the consent of natives living in these areas should have been asked.
The western ‘frontier’ of the USA was a shifting one, and as it moved,
the natives also were forced to move back.

The landscapes of America changed drastically in the nineteenth
century. The Europeans treated the land differently from the natives.
Some of the migrants from Britain and France were younger sons who
would not inherit their fathers’ property and therefore were eager to own
land in America. Later, there were waves of immigrants from countries
like Germany, Sweden and Italy who had lost their lands to big farmers,
and wanted farms they could own. People from Poland were happy to
work in the prairie grasslands, which reminded them of the steppes of
their homes, and were excited at being able to buy huge properties at very
low prices. They cleared land and developed agriculture, introducing crops
(rice and cotton) which could not grow in Europe and therefore could be
sold there for profit. To protect their huge farms from wild animals –
wolves and mountain lions – these were hunted to extinction. They  felt
totally secure only with the invention of barbed wire in 1873.

The climate of the southern region was too hot for Europeans to
work outdoors, and the experience of South American colonies had
shown that the natives who had been enslaved had died in large
numbers. Plantation owners therefore bought slaves in Africa. Protests
by anti-slavery groups led to a ban on slave trade, but the Africans
who were in the USA remained slaves, as did their children.
The northern states of the USA, where the economy did not depend
on plantations (and therefore on slavery), argued for ending slavery
which they condemned as an inhuman practice. In 1861-65, there
was a war between the states that wanted to retain slavery and those
supporting abolition. The latter won. Slavery was abolished, though it
was only in the twentieth century that the African Americans were
able to win the battle for civil liberties, and segregation between ‘whites’
and ‘non-whites’ in schools and public transport was ended.
The Canadian government had a problem which was not to be solved
for a long time, and which seemed more urgent than the question of
the natives – in 1763 Canada had been won by the British after a war
with France. The French settlers repeatedly demanded autonomous
political status. It was only in 1867 that this problem was solved by
organising canada as a Confederation of autonomous states.
The Native Peoples Lose their Land
In the USA, as settlement expanded, the natives were induced or forced
to move, after signing treaties selling their land. The prices paid were
very low, and there were instances when the Americans (a term used

to mean the European people of the USA) cheated them by taking more
land or paying less than promised.
Even high officials saw nothing wrong in depriving the native peoples
of their land. This is seen by an episode in Georgia, a state in the USA.
Officials had argued that the Cherokee tribe was governed by state
laws, but could not enjoy the rights of citizens. (This was despite the
fact that, of all the native peoples, the Cherokees were the ones who
had made the most effort to learn English and to understand the
American way of life; even so they were not allowed the rights of citizens.)
In 1832, an important judgment was announced by the US Chief
Justice, John Marshall. He said that the Cherokees were
‘a distinct community, occupying its own territory in which the laws of
Georgia had no force’, and that they had sovereignty in certain matters.
US President Andrew Jackson had a reputation for fighting against
economic and political privilege, but when it came to the Indians, he
was a different person. He refused to honour the Chief Justice’s
judgment, and ordered the US army to evict the Cherokees from their
land and drive them to the Great American Desert. Of the 15,000
people thus forced to go, over a quarter died along the ‘Trail of Tears’.
Those who took the land occupied by the tribes justified it by saying
the natives did not deserve to occupy land which they did not use to
the maximum. They went on to criticise them for being lazy, since they
did not use their crafts skills to produce goods for the market, for not
being interested in learning English or dressing ‘correctly’ (which meant
like the Europeans). They deserved to ‘die out’, they argued. The prairies
were cleared for farmland, and wild bison killed off. ‘Primitive man will
disappear with the primitive animal’ wrote a visiting Frenchman.

between them. They were locked off in small areas called
‘reservations’, which often was land with which they had no
earlier connection. They did not give in without a fight. The
US army crushed a series of rebellions from 1865 to 1890,
and in Canada there were armed revolts by the Metis (people
of native European descent) between 1869 and 1885. But
after that they gave up.
In 1854, the President of the USA received a letter from a
native leader, Chief Seattle. The president had asked the
chief to sign a treaty giving a large part of the land they
lived on to the American government. The Chief replied:
‘How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?
The idea is strange to us. If you do not own the freshness of
the air and the sparkle of the water, how can one buy them?
Every part of the earth is sacred to my people. Every shining
pine-needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark
woods, every clearing and every humming insect is holy
in the memory and experience of my people. The sap which
courses through the trees carries the memories of the red
So, when the Great Chief in Washington sends word that
he wishes to buy our land, he asks much of us. The Great
Chief sends word that he will reserve us a place so that we
can live comfortably. He will be our father and we will be
his children. So we will consider your offer to buy our land.
But it will not be easy. For this land is sacred to us. The
shining water that moves in the streams and rivers is not
just water but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you land,
you must remember that it is sacred and you must teach
your children that it is sacred and that each ghostly
reflection in the clear water of the lakes tells of events and
memories in the life of my people. The water’s murmur is
the voice of my father’s father…’
The Gold Rush, and the Growth of
Industries
There was always the hope that there was gold in North
America. In the 1840s, traces of gold were found in the USA,
in California. This led to the ‘Gold Rush’, when thousands of
eager Europeans hurried to America in the hope of making a
quick fortune. This led to the building of railway lines across
the continent, for which thousands of Chinese workers were
recruited. The USA’s railway was completed by 1870, that of
Anthropology
It is significant that it
was at this time (from
the 1840s) that the
subject of ‘anthropology’
(which had been
developed in France)
was introduced in North
America, out of a
curiosity to study the
differences between
native ‘primitive’
communities and the
‘civilised’ communities
of Europe. Some
anthropologists argued
that just as there were
no ‘primitive’ people to
be found in Europe, the
American natives too
would ‘die out’.

Canada by 1885. ‘The old nations
creep on at a snail’s pace’ said Andrew
Carnegie, a poor immigrant from
Scotland who became one of the first
millionaire industrialists in the USA,
‘the Republic thunders on at the speed
of an express’.
One reason why the Industrial
Revolution happened in England
when it did was because small
peasants were losing their land to
big farmers, and moving to jobs in
factories (see Theme 9). In North
America, industries developed for
very different reasons – to
manufacture railway equipment so
that rapid transport could link distant places, and to produce
machinery which would make large-scale farming easier. Industrial
towns grew and factories multiplied, both in the USA and Canada.
In 1860, the USA had been an undeveloped economy. In
1890, it was the leading industrial power in the world.
Large-scale agriculture also expanded. Vast
areas were cleared and divided up into farms.
By 1890, the bison had almost been
exterminated, thus ending the life of hunting
the natives had followed for centuries. In
1892, the USA’s continental expansion was
complete. The area between the Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans was divided up into states.
There no longer remained the ‘frontier’ that
had pulled European settlers west for many
decades. Within a few years the USA was
setting up its own colonies – in Hawaii and
the Philippines. It had become an imperial
power.

Constitutional Rights
The ‘democratic spirit’ which had been the rallying cry of the settlers
in their fight for independence in the 1770s, came to define the identity
of the USA against the monarchies and aristocracies of the Old World.
Also important to them was that their constitution included the
individual’s ‘right to property’, which the state could not override.
But both democratic rights (the right to vote for representatives to
Congress and for the President) and the right to property were only for
white men. Daniel Paul, a Canadian native, pointed out in 2000 that
Thomas Paine, the champion of democracy at the time of the War for
American Independence and the French Revolution, ‘used the Indians
as models of how society might be organized’. He used this to argue
that ‘the Native Americans by their example sowed the seeds for the
long-drawn-out movement towards democracy by the people of Europe’
(We Were Not the Savages, p. 333)
The winds of change…
Not till the 1920s did things begin to improve for the native peoples of
the USA and Canada. The Problem of Indian Administration, a survey
directed by social scientist Lewis Meriam and published in 1928, only
a few years before the USA was swept by a major economic depression
that affected all its people, painted a grim picture of the terribly poor
health and education facilities for natives in reservations.
White Americans felt sympathy for the natives who were being discouraged
from the full exercise of their cultures and simultaneously denied the benefits
of citizenship. This led to a landmark law in the USA, the Indian
Reorganisation Act of 1934, which gave natives in reservations the right to
buy land and take loans.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the US and Canadian governments thought
of ending all special provisions for the natives in the hope that they
would ‘join the mainstream’, that is, adopt European culture. But the
natives did not want this. In 1954, in the ‘Declaration of Indian Rights’
prepared by them, a number of native peoples accepted citizenship of
the USA but on condition that their reservations would not be taken
away and their traditions would not be interfered with. A similar
development occurred in Canada. In 1969 the government announced
that they would ‘not recognise aboriginal rights’. The natives, in a well-
organised opposition move, held a series of demonstrations and debates.
The question could not be resolved till 1982, when the Constitution Act
accepted the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the natives. Many
details remain to be worked out. Today, it is clear that the native peoples
of both countries, though reduced so much in numbers from what they
had been in the eighteenth century, have been able to assert their right
to their own cultures and, particularly in Canada, to their sacred lands,
in a way their ancestors could not have done in the 1880s.

AUSTRALIA
As in the Americas, human habitation in Australia has a long history.
The ‘aborigines’ (a general name given to a number of different
societies) began to arrive on the continent over 40,000 years ago (it is
possible it was even earlier). They came from New Guinea, which was
connected to Australia by a land-bridge. In the natives’ traditions,
they did not come to Australia, but had always been there. The past
centuries were called the ‘Dreamtime’ – something difficult for
Europeans to understand, since the distinction between past and
present is blurred.
In the late eighteenth century, there were between 350 and 750 native
communities in Australia each with its own language (even today 200 of
these languages are spoken). There is another large group of indigenous
people living in the north, called the Torres Strait Islanders. The term
‘Aborigine’ is not used for these as they are believed to have migrated from
elsewhere and belong to a different race. Together, they make up 2.4 per
cent of Australia’s population in 2005.
Australia is sparsely populated, and even now most of the towns are
along the coast (where the British first arrived in 1770) because the
central region is arid desert.

The story of the interaction between the European settlers, the native
peoples and the land in Australia has many points of similarity to the
story of the Americas, though it began nearly 300 years later. Initial
reports from Captain Cook and his crew about encounters with natives
are enthusiastic about their friendliness. There was a sharp reversal of
feeling on the part of the British when Cook was killed by a native – not
in Australia, but in Hawaii. As often happened, a single incident of this
nature was used by colonisers to justify subsequent acts of violence towards
other people.
A Description of the Sydney Area in 1790
‘Aboriginal production had been dramatically disturbed by the British
presence. The arrival of a thousand hungry mouths, followed by hundreds
more, put unprecedented pressure on local food resources.
So what would the Daruk people have thought of all this? To them such large-
scale destruction of sacred places and strange, violent behaviour towards their
land was inexplicable. The newcomers seemed to knock down trees without
any reason, for they were not making canoes, gathering bush honey or catching
animals. Stones were moved and stacked together, clay dug up, shaped and
cooked, holes were made in the ground, large unwieldy structures built. At first
they may have equated the clearing with the creation of a sacred ceremonial
ground…Perhaps they thought a huge ritual gathering was to be held, dangerous
business from which they should steer well clear. There is no doubt the Daruks
subsequently avoided the settlement, for the only way to bring them back was
by an official kidnapping.’

They did not foresee that in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries nearly 90 per cent of them would die by exposure to
germs, by the loss of their lands and resources, and in battles
against the settlers. The experiment of settling Brazil with
Portuguese convicts had been abandoned when their violent
behaviour provoked angry reprisals from the natives. The British
had adopted the same practice in the American colonies until they
became independent. Then they continued it in Australia. Most of
the early settlers were convicts who had been deported from England
and, when their jail term ended, were allowed to live as free people
in Australia on condition that they did not return to Britain. With
no recourse but to make a life for themselves in this land so different
from their own, they felt no hesitation about ejecting natives from
land they took over for cultivation.

The economic development of Australia under European
settlement was not as varied as in America. Vast sheep farms and
mining stations were established over a long period and with much
labour, followed by vineyards and wheat farming. These came to
form the basis of the country’s prosperity. When the states were
united, and it was decided that a new capital would be built for
Australia in 1911, one name suggested for it was Woolwheatgold!
Ultimately, it was called Canberra (= kamberra, a native word
meaning ‘meeting place’).
Some natives were employed in farms, under conditions of work
so harsh that it was little different from slavery. Later, Chinese
immigrants provided cheap labour, as in California, but unease about
being dependent on non-whites led to the governments in both
countries to ban Chinese immigrants. Till 1974, such was the popular
fear that ‘dark’ people from South Asia or Southeast Asia might
migrate to Australia in large numbers that there was a government
policy to keep ‘non-white’ people out.

The Winds of Change…
In 1968, people were electrified by a lecture by the anthropologist W.E.H.
Stanner, entitled ‘The Great Australian Silence’ – the silence of historians
about the aborigines. From the 1970s, as was happening in North America,
there was an eagerness to understand natives not as anthropological
curiosities but as communities with distinct cultures, unique ways of
understanding nature and climate, with a sense of community which
had vast bodies of stories, textile and painting and carving skills, which
should be understood and recorded and respected. Underlying it all was
the urgent question which Henry Reynolds later articulated in a powerful
book, Why Weren’t We Told? This condemned the practice of writing
Australian history as though it had begun with Captain Cook’s ‘discovery’.
Since then, university departments have been instituted to study native
cultures, galleries of native art have been added to art galleries, museums
have been enlarged to incorporate dioramas and imaginatively designed
rooms explaining native culture, and natives have begun writing their
own life histories. This has been a wonderful effort. It has also occurred
at a critical time, because if native cultures had remained ignored, by this
time much of such cultures would have been forgotten. From 1974,
‘multiculturalism’ has been official policy in Australia, which gave equal
respect to native cultures and to the different cultures of the immigrants
from Europe and Asia.

From the 1970s, as the term ‘human rights’ began to be heard at
meetings of the UNO and other international agencies, the Australian
public realised with dismay that, in contrast to the USA, Canada and
New Zealand, Australia had no treaties with the natives formalising
the takeover of land by Europeans. The government had always termed
the land of Australia terra nullius, that is belonging to nobody.

There was also a long and agonising history of children of mixed blood

Agitation around these questions led to enquiries and to two important
decisions: one, to recognise that the natives had strong historic bonds
with the land which was ‘sacred’ to them, and which should be

Paths to Modernisation
EAST ASIA at the beginning of the nineteenth century was
dominated by China. The Qing dynasty, heir to a long tradition,
seemed secure in its power, while Japan, a small island country,
seemed to be locked in isolation. Yet, within a few decades China
was thrown into turmoil unable to face the colonial challenge.
The imperial government lost political control, was unable to
reform effectively and the country was convulsed by civil war.
Japan on the other hand was successful in building a modern
nation-state, creating an industrial economy and even
establishing a colonial empire by incorporating Taiwan (1895)
and Korea (1910). It defeated China, the land that had been
the source of its culture and ideals, in 1894, and Russia, a
European power, in 1905.
The Chinese reacted slowly and faced immense difficulties
as they sought to redefine their traditions to cope with the
modern world, and to rebuild their national strength and become
free from Western and Japanese control. They found that they
could achieve both objectives – of removing inequalities and of
rebuilding their country – through revolution. The Chinese
Communist Party emerged victorious from the civil war in 1949.
However, by the end of the 1970s Chinese leaders felt that the
ideological system was retarding economic growth and
development. This led to wide-ranging reforms of the economy
that brought back capitalism and the free market even as the
Communist Party retained political control.
Japan became an advanced industrial nation but its drive
for empire led to war and defeat at the hands of the Anglo-
American forces. The US Occupation marked the beginning of a
more democratic political system and Japan rebuilt its economy
to emerge by the 1970s as a major economic power.
The Japanese path to modernisation was built on capitalist
principles and took place within a world dominated by Western
colonialism. Japanese expansion was justified by the call to
resist Western domination and liberate Asia. The rapid
development underlined the strength of tradition in Japanese
institutions and society, their ability to learn and the strength
of nationalism.
China and Japan have had a long tradition of historical writings,
as history was an important guide for the rulers. The past
provided the standards by which they would be judged and

232  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
the rulers established official departments to maintain records
and write dynastic histories. Sima Qian (145-90 BCE) is
considered the greatest historian of early China. In Japan,
Chinese cultural influence led to history being given a similar
importance. One of the earliest acts of the Meiji government
was to establish, in 1869, a bureau to collect records and write,
as it were, a victor’s version of the Meiji Restoration. There was
great respect for the written word and literary ability was highly
valued. This has meant that a wide range of written materials –
official histories, scholarly writings, popular literature, religious
tracts – are available. Printing and publishing were important
industries in the pre-modern period and it is possible, for
instance, to trace the distribution of a book in eighteenth-
century China or Japan. Modern scholars have used these
materials in new and different ways.
Modern scholarship has built on the work of Chinese
intellectuals such as Liang Qichao or Kume Kunitake (1839-
1931), one of the pioneers of modern history in Japan, as well
as earlier writings by European travellers, such as the Italian
Marco Polo (1254-1324, in China from 1274 to 1290), the
Jesuit priests Mateo Ricci (1552-1610) in China and Luis Frois
(1532-97), in Japan, all of whom left rich accounts of these
countries. It has also benefited from the writings of Christian
missionaries in the nineteenth century whose work provides
valuable material for our understanding of these countries.
Scholarship in English from Joseph Needham’s monumental
work on the history of science in Chinese civilisation or George
Sansom’s on Japanese history and culture has grown and there
is an immense body of sophisticated scholarship available to
us today. In recent years, writings by Chinese and Japanese
scholars have been translated into English, some of whom teach
abroad and write in English, and in the case of Chinese scholars,
since the 1980s, many have been working in Japan as well
and write in Japanese. This has meant that we have scholarly
writings from many parts of the globe that give us a richer and
deeper picture of these countries.
Naito Konan* (1866-1934)
A leading Japanese scholar of China, Naito Konan’s writings
influenced scholars worldwide. Using the new tools of Western
historiography Naito built on a long tradition of studying China
as well as bringing his experience as a journalist there. He
helped establish the Department of Oriental Studies in Kyoto
University in 1907. In Shinaron [On China (1914)], he argued
that republican government offered the Chinese a way to end
aristocratic control and centralised power that had existed since
the Sung dynasty (960-1279) – a way to revitalise local society
where reform must begin. He saw in Chinese history strengths
that would make it modern and democratic. Japan, he thought
had an important role to play in China but he underestimated
the power of Chinese nationalism.

Introduction
China and Japan present a marked physical contrast. China is a vast
continental country that spans many climatic zones; the core is dominated
by three major river systems: the Yellow River (Huang He), the Yangtse
River (Chang Jiang – the third longest river in the world) and the Pearl
River. A large part of the country is mountainous.
PATHS TO MODERNISATION
The dominant ethnic group are the Han and the major language is
Chinese (Putonghua) but there are many other nationalities such as
the Uighur, Hui, Manchu and Tibetan, and aside from dialects such as
Cantonese (Yue) and Shanghainese (Wu) there are other minority
languages spoken as well.
Chinese food reflects this regional diversity with at least four distinct
types. The best known is southern or Cantonese cuisine – as most
overseas Chinese come from the Canton area – which includes dim
sum (literally touch your heart), an assortment of pastries and
dumplings. In the north, wheat is the staple food while in Szechuan
spices brought by Buddhist monks in the ancient period, along the
silk route, and chillies by Portuguese traders in the fifteenth century,
have created a fiery cuisine. In eastern China, both rice and wheat
are eaten.

Japan, by contrast, is a string of islands, the four largest being
Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku and Hokkaido. The Okinawan chain is the
southernmost, about the same latitude as the Bahamas. More than
50 per cent of the land area of the main islands is mountainous and
Japan is situated in a very active earthquake zone. These geographical
conditions have influenced architecture. The population is largely
Japanese but there are a small Ainu minority and Koreans who were
forcibly brought as labour when Korea was a Japanese colony.
Japan lacks a tradition of animal rearing. Rice is the staple crop
and fish the major source of protein. Raw fish (sashimi or sushi) has
now become a widely popular dish around the world as it is considered
very healthy.
JAPAN
The Political System
An emperor had ruled Japan from Kyoto but by the twelfth century
the imperial court lost power to shoguns, who in theory ruled in the
name of the emperor. From 1603 to 1867, members of the Tokugawa
family held the position of shogun. The country was divided into over
250 domains under the rule of lords called daimyo. The shogun exercised
power over the domainal lords, ordering them to stay at the capital
Edo (modern Tokyo) for long periods so that they would not pose a
threat. He also controlled the major cities and mines. The samurai (the
warrior class) were the ruling elite and served the shoguns and daimyo.
In the late sixteenth century, three changes laid the pattern for
future development. One, the peasantry was disarmed and only the
samurai could carry swords. This ensured peace and order, ending the
frequent wars of the previous century. Two, the daimyo were ordered
to live in the capitals of their domains, each with a large degree of
autonomy. Third, land surveys identified owners and taxpayers and
graded land productivity to ensure a stable revenue base.
The daimyo’s capitals became bigger, so that by the mid-seventeenth
century, Japan not only had the most populated city in the world –
Edo – but also two other large cities – Osaka and Kyoto, and at least
half a dozen castle-towns with populations of over 50,000. (By contrast,
most European countries of the time had only one large city.) This led
to the growth of a commercial economy, and created financial and
credit systems. A person’s merit began to be more valued than his
status. A vibrant culture blossomed in the towns, where the fast-
growing class of merchants patronised theatre and the arts. As people
enjoyed reading, it became possible for gifted writers to earn a living
solely by writing. In Edo, people could ‘rent’ a book for the price of a
bowl of noodles. This shows how popular reading had become and
gives a glimpse into the scale of printing*.

Japan was considered rich, because it imported luxury goods like
silk from China and textiles from India. Paying for these imports with
gold and silver strained the economy and led the Tokugawa to put
restrictions on the export of precious metals. They also took steps to
develop the silk industry in Nishijin in Kyoto so as to reduce imports.
The silk from Nishijin came to be known as the best in the world.
Other developments such as the increased use of money and the
creation of a stock market in rice show that the economy was developing
in new ways.
Social and intellectual changes – such as the study of ancient
Japanese literature – led people to question the degree of Chinese
influence and to argue that the essence of being Japanese could be
found long before the contact with China, in such early classics as the
Tale of the Genji and in the myths of origin that said that the islands
were created by the gods and that the emperor was a descendant of
the Sun Goddess.
Tale of the Genji
A fictionalised diary of the Heian court written by Murasaki Shikibu,
the Tale of the Genji became the central work of fiction in Japanese
literature. That period saw the emergence of many women writers,
like Murasaki, who wrote in the Japanese script, while men wrote
in the Chinese script, used for education and government. The novel
depicts the romantic life of Prince Genji and is a striking picture of
the aristocratic atmosphere of the Heian court. It shows the
independence that women had in choosing their husbands and
living their lives.
The Meiji Restoration
Internal discontent coincided with demands for trade and diplomatic
relations. In 1853, the USA sent Commodore Matthew Perry (1794-
1858) to Japan to demand that the government sign a treaty that
would permit trade and open diplomatic relations, which it did the
following year. Japan lay on the route to China which the USA saw as
a major market; also, their whaling ships in the Pacific needed a place
to refuel. At that time, there was only one Western country that traded
with Japan, Holland.
Perry’s arrival had an important effect on Japanese politics. The emperor,
who till then had had little political power, now re-emerged as an important
figure. In 1868, a movement forcibly removed the shogun from power,
and brought the Emperor to Edo. This was made the capital and renamed
Tokyo, which means ‘eastern capital’.

236  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
Officials and the people were aware that some European countries
were building colonial empires in India and elsewhere. News of China
being defeated by the British (see p. 244) was flowing in, and this was
even depicted in popular plays, so that there was a real fear that Japan
might be made a colony. Many scholars and leaders wanted to learn
from the new ideas in Europe rather than ignore them as the Chinese
were doing; others sought to exclude the Europeans even while being
ready to adopt the new technologies they offered. Some argued for a
gradual and limited ‘opening’ to the outer world.
The government launched a policy with the slogan ‘fukoku kyohei’
(rich country, strong army). They realised that they needed to develop
their economy and build a strong army, otherwise they would face the
prospect of being subjugated like India. To do this they needed to
create a sense of nationhood among the people, and to transform
subjects into citizens.
At the same time, the new government also worked to build what
they called the ‘emperor system’. (Japanese scholars use this term as
the emperor was part of a system, along with the bureaucracy and the
military, that exercised power.) Officials were sent to study the European
monarchies on which they planned to model their own. The Emperor
would be treated with reverence as he was considered a direct
descendant of the Sun Goddess but he was also shown as the leader of
westernisation. His birthday became a national holiday, he wore
Western-style military uniforms, and edicts were issued in his name to
set up modern institutions. The Imperial Rescript on Education of
1890 urged people to pursue learning, advance public good and promote
common interests.

A new school system began to be built from the 1870s. Schooling was
compulsory for boys and girls and by 1910 almost universal. Tuition fees
were minimal. The curriculum had been based on Western models but by
the 1870s, while emphasising modern ideas, stress was placed on loyalty
and the study of Japanese history. The ministry of education exercised
control over the curriculum and in the selection of textbooks, as well as in
teachers’ training. What was called ‘moral culture‘ had to be taught, and
texts urged children to revere their parents, be loyal to the nation, and
become good citizens.
The Japanese had borrowed their written script from the Chinese in
the sixth century. However, since their language is very different
from Chinese they developed two phonetic alphabets – hiragana
and katakana. Hiragana is considered feminine because it was used
by many women writers in the Heian period (such as Murasaki). It
is written using a mixture of Chinese characters and phonetics so
that the main part of the word is written with a character – for
instance, in ‘going’, ‘go’ would be written with a character and the
‘ing’ in phonetics.
The existence of a phonetic syllabary meant that knowledge spread
from the elites to the wider society relatively quickly. In the 1880s it
was suggested that Japanese develop a completely phonetic script,
or adopt a European language. Neither was done.
To integrate the nation, the Meiji government imposed a new
administrative structure by altering old village and domain boundaries.
The administrative unit had to have revenue adequate to maintain the
local schools and health facilities, as well as serve as a recruitment
centre for the military. All young men over twenty had to do a period
of military service. A modern military force was developed. A legal
system was set up to regulate the formation of political groups, control
the holding of meetings and impose strict censorship. In all these
measures the government had to face opposition. The military and the
bureaucracy were put under the direct command of the emperor. This
meant that even after a constitution was enacted these two groups
remained outside the control of the government. In all these measures
the government faced opposition.
The tension between these different ideals represented by a
democratic constitution and a modern army was to have far-reaching
consequences. The army pressed for a vigorous foreign policy to acquire
more territory. This led to wars with China and Russia, in both of
which Japan was the victor. Popular demand for greater democracy
was often in opposition to the government’s aggressive policies. Japan
developed economically and acquired a colonial empire that suppressed
the spread of democracy at home and put it in collision with the people
it colonised.

Modernising the Economy
Another important part of the Meiji reforms was the modernising of
the economy. Funds were raised by levying an agricultural tax. Japan’s
first railway line, between Tokyo and the port of Yokohama, was built
in 1870-72. Textile machinery was imported from Europe, and foreign
technicians were employed to train workers, as well as to teach in
universities and schools, and Japanese students were sent abroad. In
1872, modern banking institutions were launched. Companies like
Mitsubishi and Sumitomo were helped through subsidies and tax
benefits to become major shipbuilders so that Japanese trade was
from now carried in Japanese ships. Zaibatsu (large business
organisations controlled by individual families) dominated the economy
till after the Second World War.
The population, 35 million in 1872, increased to 55 million in 1920.
To reduce population pressure the government actively encouraged
migration, first to the northern island of Hokkaido, which had been a
largely autonomous area where the indigenous people called the Ainu
lived, and then to Hawaii and Brazil, as well as to the growing colonial
empire of Japan. Within Japan there was a shift to towns as industry
developed. By 1925, 21 per cent of the population lived in cities; by
1935, this figure had gone up to 32 per cent (22.5 million).
Industrial Workers
The number of people in manufacturing increased from 700,000 in
1870 to 4 million in 1913. Most of them worked in units employing
less than five people and using neither machinery nor electric power.
Over half of those employed
in modern factories were
women. And it was women
who organised the first
modern strike in 1886.
After 1900, the number of
men began to increase but
only in the 1930s did male
workers
begin
outnumber women.
The size of factories also
began to increase. Factories
employing more than a

1,000 in 1909, jumped to
over 2,000 by 1920 and
4,000 by the 1930s; yet

that employed less than five employees. This sustained the family-
centred ideology, just as nationalism was sustained by a strong
patriarchal system under an emperor who was like a family patriarch.
The rapid and unregulated growth of industry and the demand for
natural resources such as timber led to environmental destruction.
Tanaka Shozo, elected to the first House of Representatives, launched
the first agitation against industrial pollution in 1897 with 800 villagers
in a mass protest forcing the government to take action.
Aggressive Nationalism
The Meiji constitution was based on a restricted franchise and created
a Diet (the Japanese used the German word for parliament because of
the influence of German legal ideas) with limited powers. The leaders
who brought about the imperial restoration continued to exercise power
and even established political parties. Between 1918 and 1931, popularly
elected prime ministers formed cabinets. Thereafter, they lost power
to national unity cabinets formed across party lines. The emperor was
the commander of the forces and from 1890 this was interpreted to
mean that the army and the navy had independent control. In 1899,
the prime minister ordered that only serving generals and admirals
could become ministers. This strengthening of the military, together
with the expansion of Japan’s colonial empire, was connected with the
fear that Japan was at the mercy of the Western powers. This fear was
used to silence opposition to military expansion and to higher taxes to
fund the armed forces.

240  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
‘Westernisation’ and ‘Tradition’
Successive generations of Japanese intellectuals had different views
on Japan’s relations with other countries. To some, the USA and
western European countries were at the highest point of civilisation,
to which Japan aspired. Fukuzawa Yukichi, a leading Meiji
intellectual, expressed this by saying that Japan must ‘expel Asia’.
He meant that Japan must shed its ‘Asian’ characteristics and
become part of the West.
Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835-1901)
Born in an impoverished samurai family, he studied in Nagasaki
and Osaka learning Dutch and Western sciences and, later,
English. In 1860, he went as a translator for the first Japanese
embassy to the USA. This provided material for a book on the
West, written not in the classical but in the spoken style that
became extremely popular. He established a school that is today
the Keio University. He was one of the core members of the
Meirokusha, a society to promote Western learning.
In The Encouragement to Learning (Gakumon no susume,1872-76)
he was very critical of Japanese knowledge: ‘All that Japan has
to be proud of is its scenery’. He advocated not just modern
factories and institutions but the cultural essence of the West –
the spirit of civilisation. With this spirit it would be possible to
build a new citizen. His principle was: ‘Heaven did not create
men above men, nor set men below men.’
The next generation questioned this total acceptance of Western
ideas and urged that national pride be built on indigenous values.
The philosopher Miyake Setsurei (1860-1945) argued that each
nation must develop its special talents in the interest of world
civilisation: ‘To devote oneself to one’s country is to devote oneself
to the world.’ By contrast, many intellectuals were attracted to
Western liberalism and wanted a Japan based not on the military
but on democracy. Ueki Emori (1857-1892), a leader of the Popular
Rights Movement, was demanding constitutional government,
admired the French Revolution’s doctrine of the natural rights of
man and of popular sovereignty, and spoke for a liberal education
that would develop each individual: ‘Freedom is more precious
than order.’ Others even advocated voting rights for women. This
pressure led the government to announce a constitution.

Daily Life
Japan’s transformation into a modern society can be seen also in the
changes in everyday life. The patriarchal household system comprised
many generations living together under the control of the head of the
house, but as more people became affluent, new ideas of the family
spread. The new home (homu as the Japanese say, using the English
word) was that of the nuclear family, where husband and wife lived as
breadwinner and homemaker. This new
concept of domesticity in turn generated
demands for new types of domestic goods,
new types of family entertainments,
and new forms of housing.
In the 1920s, construction
companies made cheap
housing available for a down payment of 200 yen and a
monthly instalment of 12 yen for ten years – this at a
time when the salary of a bank employee (a person with
higher education) was 40 yen per month.
CAR-CLUB
Moga: An abbreviation for ‘modern

together in the twentieth century of
ideas of gender equality, a

Transport in cities improved with
electric trams, public parks were
opened from 1878, and department
stores began to be built. In Tokyo,
the Ginza became a fashionable
area for Ginbura, a word combining
‘Ginza’ and ‘burbura’ (walking
aimlessly). The first radio stations
opened in 1925. Matsui Sumako, an actress, became a national star
with her portrayal of Nora in the Norwegian writer Ibsen’s A Doll’s
House. Movies began to be made in 1899 and soon there were a
dozen companies making hundreds of films. The period was one of
great vitality and the questioning of traditional norms of social
and political behaviour.

242  THEMES IN WORLD HISTORY
‘Overcoming Modernity’
State-centred nationalism found full expression in the 1930s and 1940s
as Japan launched wars to extend its empire in China and other parts
of Asia, a war that merged into the Second World War after Japan
attacked the USA at Pearl Harbor. This period saw greater controls on
society, the repression and imprisonment of dissidents, as well as the
formation of patriotic societies, many of them women’s organisations,
to support the war.
An influential symposium on ‘Overcoming Modernity’ in 1943 debated
the dilemma facing Japan – of how to combat the West while being
modern. A musician, Moroi Saburo, posed the question of how to rescue
music from the art of sensory stimulation and restore it to an art of the
spirit. He was not rejecting Western music but trying to find a way that
went beyond merely rewriting or playing Japanese music on Western
instruments. The philosopher Nishitani Keiji defined ‘modern’ as the
unity of three streams of Western thought: the Renaissance, the
Protestant Reformation, and the rise of natural sciences. He argued
that Japan’s ‘moral energy’ (a term taken from the German philosopher
Ranke) had helped it to escape colonisation and it was its duty to establish
a new world order, a Greater East Asia. For this a new vision that would
integrate science and religion was necessary.
After Defeat: Re-emerging as a Global
Economic Power
Japan’s attempt to carve out a colonial empire ended with its defeat by
the Allied forces. It has been argued that nuclear bombs were dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to shorten the war. But others think the
immense destruction and suffering it caused were unnecessary. Under
the US-led Occupation (1945-47) Japan was demilitarised and a new
constitution introduced. This had Article 9, the so-called ‘no war clause’
that renounces the use of war as an instrument of state policy. Agrarian
reforms, the re-establishment of trade unions and an attempt to
dismantle the zaibatsu or large monopoly houses that dominated the
Japanese economy were also carried out. Political parties were revived
and the first post-war elections held in 1946 where women voted for
the first time.
The rapid rebuilding of the Japanese economy after its shattering
defeat was called a post-war ‘miracle’. But it was more than that – it
was firmly rooted in its long history. The constitution was democratised
only now, but the Japanese had a historic tradition of popular struggles
and intellectual engagement with how to broaden political participation.
The social cohesion of the pre-war years was strengthened, allowing
for a close working of the government, bureaucracy and industry. US
support, as well as the demand created by the Korean and the
Vietnamese wars also helped the Japanese economy.

health and the environment. Cadmium poisoning, which
led to a painful disease, was an early indicator, followed
by mercury poisoning in Minamata in the 1960s and
problems caused by air pollution in the early 1970s.
Grass-roots pressure groups began to demand
recognition of these problems as well as compensation
for the victims. Government action and new legal
regulations helped to improve conditions. From the mid-
1980s there has been an increasing decline in interest in
environmental issues as Japan enacted some of the strictest environmental
controls in the world. Today, as a developed country it faces the challenge
of using its political and technological capabilities to maintain its position
as a leading world power.
CHINA
The modern history of China has revolved around the question of how
to regain sovereignty, end the humiliation of foreign occupation and
bring about equality and development. Chinese debates were marked
by the views of three groups. The early reformers such as Kang Youwei
(1858-1927) or Liang Qichao (1873-1929) tried to use traditional ideas
in new and different ways to meet the challenges posed by the West.
Second, republican revolutionaries such as Sun Yat-sen, the first
president of the republic, were inspired by ideas from Japan and the
West. The third, the Communist Party of China (CCP) wanted to end
age-old inequalities and drive out the foreigners.
The beginning of modern China can be traced to its first encounter
with the West in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when Jesuit
missionaries introduced Western sciences such as astronomy and
mathematics. Limited though its immediate impact was, it set in motion
events that gathered momentum in the nineteenth century when Britain

used force to expand its lucrative trade in opium leading to the first
Opium War (1839-42). This undermined the ruling Qing dynasty and
strengthened demands for reform and change.
Qing reformers such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao realised the
need to strengthen the system and initiated policies to build a modern
administrative system, a new army and an educational system, and
set up local assemblies to establish constitutional government. They
saw the need to protect China from colonisation.
The negative example of colonised countries worked powerfully on
Chinese thinkers. The partition of Poland in the eighteenth century
was a much-discussed example. So much so that by the late 1890s
it came to be used as a verb: ‘to Poland us’ (bolan wo). India was
another such example. In 1903, the thinker Liang Qichao, who
believed that only by making people aware that China was a nation
would they be able to resist the West, wrote that India was ‘a country
that was destroyed by a non-country that is the East India Company’.
THE OPIUM TRADE
The demand for Chinese goods such as tea, silk and porcelain created a
serious balance-of-trade problem. Western goods did not find a market
in China, so payment had to be in silver. The East India Company
found a new option – opium, which grew in India. They sold the opium
in China and gave the silver that they earned to company agents in
Canton in return for letters of credit. The Company used the silver to
buy tea, silk and porcelain to sell in Britain. This was the ‘triangular
trade’ between Britain, India and China.

He criticised Indians for being cruel to their own people and subservient
to the British. Such arguments carried a powerful appeal as ordinary
Chinese could see that the British used Indian soldiers in their wars
on China.
Above all many felt that traditional ways of thinking had to be
changed. Confucianism, developed from the teachings of Confucius
(551-479 BCE) and his disciples was concerned with good conduct,
practical wisdom and proper social relationships. It influenced the
Chinese attitude toward life, provided social standards and laid the
basis for political theories and institutions. It was now seen as a major
barrier to new ideas and institutions.
To train people in modern subjects students were sent to study in
Japan, Britain and France and bring back new ideas. Many Chinese
students went to Japan in the 1890s. They not only brought back new
ideas but many became leading republicans. The Chinese borrowed
even Japanese translations of European words such as justice, rights,
and revolution because they used the same ideographic script, a reversal
of the traditional relationship. In 1905, just after the Russo-Japanese
war (a war fought on Chinese soil and over Chinese territory) the
centuries-old Chinese examination system that gave candidates entry
into the elite ruling class was abolished.
The Examination System
Entry to the elite ruling class (about 1.1 million till 1850) had been largely through
an examination. This required writing an eight-legged essay [pa-ku wen] in classical
Chinese in a prescribed form. The examination was held twice every three years, at
different levels and of those allowed to sit only 1-2 per cent passed the first level,
usually by the age of 24, to become what was called ‘beautiful talent’. At any given
time before 1850 there were about 526,869 civil and 212,330 military provincial (sheng-
yuan) degree holders in the whole country. Since there were only 27,000 official positions,
many lower-level degree holders did not have jobs. The examination acted as a barrier
to the development of science and technology as it demanded only literary skills. In
1905, it was abolished as it was based on skills in classical Chinese learning that had,
it was felt, no relevance for the modern world.
Establishing the Republic
The Manchu empire was overthrown and a republic established in
1911 under Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) who is unanimously regarded as
the founder of modern China. He came from a poor family and studied
in missionary schools where he was introduced to democracy and
Christianity. He studied medicine but was greatly concerned about
the fate of China. His programme was called the Three Principles (San

min chui). These were nationalism – this meant overthrowing the
Manchu who were seen as a foreign dynasty, as well as other foreign
imperialists; democracy or establishing democratic government; and
socialism regulating capital and equalising landholdings.
The social and political situation continued to be unstable. On 4
May 1919, an angry demonstration was held in Beijing to protest
against the decisions of the post-war peace conference. Despite being
an ally of the victorious side led by Britain, China did not get back
the territories seized from it. The protest became a movement. It
galvanised a whole generation to attack tradition and to call for saving
China through modern science, democracy and nationalism.
Revolutionaries called for driving out the foreigners, who were
controlling the country’s resources, to remove inequalities and reduce
poverty. They advocated reforms such as the use of simple language
in writing, abolishing the practice of foot-binding and the
subordination of women, equality in marriage, and economic
development to end poverty. After the republican revolution the
country entered a period of turmoil. The Guomindang (the National
People’s Party) and the CCP emerged as major forces striving to unite
the country and bring stability.
Sun Yat-sen’s ideas became the basis of the political philosophy of
the Guomindang. They identified the ‘four great needs’ as clothing,
food, housing and transportation. After the death of Sun, Chiang Kai-
shek (1887-1975) emerged as the leader of the Guomindang as he
launched a military campaign to control the ‘warlords’, regional leaders
who had usurped authority, and to eliminate the communists. He
advocated a secular and rational ‘this-worldly’ Confucianism, but also
sought to militarise the nation. The people, he said, must develop a
‘habit and instinct for unified behaviour’. He encouraged women to
cultivate the four virtues of ‘chastity, appearance, speech and work’
and recognise their role as confined to the household. Even the length
of hemlines was prescribed.
The Guomindang’s social base was in urban areas. Industrial growth
was slow and limited. In cities such as Shanghai, which became the
centres of modern growth, by 1919 an industrial working class had
appeared numbering 500,000. Of these, however, only a small
percentage were employed in modern industries such as shipbuilding.
Most were ‘petty urbanites’ (xiao shimin), traders and shopkeepers.
Urban workers, particularly women, earned very low wages. Working
hours were long and conditions of work bad. As individualism increased,
there was a growing concern with women’s rights, ways to build the
family and discussions about love and romance.
Social and cultural change was helped along by the spread of schools
and universities (Peking University was established in 1902). Journalism
flourished reflecting the growing attraction of this new thinking. The
popular Life Weekly, edited by Zao Taofen (1895-1944), is representative
of this new trend. It introduced readers to new ideas, as well as to

leader of Turkey. Its circulation increased rapidly from just 2,000 in

The story of rising

Shanghai in 1935: Buck Clayton, a black American trumpet
player, in Shanghai with his jazz orchestra lived the life of the
privileged expatriates. But he was black and once some white
Americans assaulted him and his orchestra members and threw
them out from the hotel they played in. Thus, though American,
he had greater sympathy for the plight of the Chinese being
himself a victim of racial discrimination.
Of their fight with white
Americans where they emerged
victorious he writes, ‘The
Chinese onlookers treated us
like we had done something
they always wanted to do and
followed us all the way home
cheering us like a winning
football team.’
On the poverty and hard life of
the Chinese, Clayton writes, ‘I
would see sometimes twenty or
thirty coolies pulling a big heavy
cart that in America would be
pulled by a truck or horses.
These people seemed to be nothing but human horses and
all they would get at the end of the day was just enough to
get a couple of bowls of rice and a place to sleep.
I don’t know how they did it.’
The Guomindang despite its attempts to unite the country failed
because of its narrow social base and limited political vision. A major
plank in Sun Yat-sen’s programme – regulating capital and equalising
land – was never carried out because the party ignored the peasantry
and the rising social inequalities. It sought to impose military order
rather then address the problems faced by the people.

The Rise of the Communist Party of China
When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the Guomindang
retreated. The long and exhausting war weakened China. Prices
rose 30 per cent per month between 1945 and 1949, and utterly
destroyed the lives of ordinary people. Rural China faced two crises:
one ecological, with soil exhaustion, deforestation and floods,
and the second, a socio-economic one caused by exploitative
land-tenure systems, indebtedness, primitive technology and
poor communications.
The CCP had been founded in 1921, soon after the Russian
Revolution. The Russian success exercised a powerful influence
around the world and leaders such as Lenin and Trotsky went on to
establish the Comintern or the Third International in March 1918
to help bring about a world government that would end exploitation.
The Comintern and the Soviet Union supported communist parties
around the world but they worked within the traditional Marxist
understanding that revolution would be brought about by the
working class in cities. Its initial appeal across national boundaries
was immense but it soon became a tool for Soviet interests and was
dissolved in 1943. Mao Zedong (1893-1976), who emerged as a major
CCP leader, took a different path by basing his revolutionary
programme on the peasantry. His success made the CCP a powerful
political force that ultimately won against the Guomindang.
Mao Zedong’s radical approach can be seen in Jiangxi, in the
mountains, where they camped from 1928 to 1934, secure from
Guomindang attacks. A strong peasants’ council (soviet) was
organised, united through confiscation and redistribution of land.
Mao, unlike other leaders, stressed the need for an independent
government and army. He had become aware of women’s problems
and supported the emergence of rural women’s associations,
promulgated a new marriage law that forbade arranged
marriages, stopped purchase or sale of marriage contracts and
simplified divorce.
In a survey in 1930 in Xunwu, Mao Zedong looked at everyday
commodities such as salt and soya beans, at the relative strengths of
local organisations, at petty traders and craftsmen, ironsmiths and
prostitutes, and the strength of religious organisations to examine
the different levels of exploitation. He gathered statistics of the
number of peasants who had sold their children and found out what
price they received – boys were sold for 100-200 yuan but there were
no instances of the sale of girls because the need was for hard labour
not sexual exploitation. It was on the basis of these studies that he
advocated ways of solving social problems.

The Guomindang blockade of the Communists’
Soviet forced the party to seek another base. This
led them to go on what came to be called the
Long March (1934-35), 6,000 gruelling and
difficult miles to Shanxi. Here, in their new base
in Yanan, they further developed their programme
to end warlordism, carry out land reforms and
fight foreign imperialism. This won them a strong
social base. In the difficult years of the war, the
Communists and the Guomindang worked
together, but after the end of the war the
Communists established themselves in power and
the Guomindang was defeated.
Establishing the New Democracy: 1949-65
The Peoples Republic of China government was established in 1949. It
was based on the principles of the ‘New Democracy’, an alliance of all
social classes, unlike the ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’* that the Soviet
Union said it had established. Critical areas of the economy were put
under government control, and private enterprise and private ownership
of land were gradually ended. This programme lasted till 1953 when
the government declared that it would launch a programme of socialist
transformation. The Great Leap Forward movement launched in 1958
was a policy to galvanise the country to industrialise rapidly. People
were encouraged to set up steel furnaces in their backyards. In the
rural areas, people’s communes (where land would be collectively owned

and cultivated) were started. By 1958, there were 26,000 communes
covering 98 per cent of the farm population.
Mao was able to mobilise the masses to attain the goals set by the
Party. His concern was with creating a ‘socialist man’ who would have
five loves: fatherland, people, labour, science and public property. Mass
organisations were created for farmers, women, students and other
groups. For instance, the All-China Democratic Women’s Federation
had 76 million members, the All-China Students Federation 3.29 million
members. These objectives and methods did not appeal to everyone in
the Party. In 1953-54, some were urging for more attention to industrial
organisation and economic growth. Liu Shaochi (1896-1969) and Deng
Xiaoping (1904-97) tried to modify the commune system as it was not
working efficiently. The steel produced in the backyard furnaces was
unusable industrially.
Conflicting Visions: 1965-78
The conflict between the Maoists wanting to create a ‘Socialist Man’
and those who objected to his emphasis on ideology rather than
expertise, culminated in Mao launching the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution in 1965 to counter his critics. The Red Guards, mainly
students and the army, was used for a campaign against old culture,
old customs and old habits. Students and professionals were sent to
the countryside to learn from the masses. Ideology (being Communist)
was more important than having professional knowledge.
Denunciations and slogans replaced rational debate.
The Cultural Revolution began a period of turmoil, weakened the
Party and severely disrupted the economy and educational system.
From the late 1960s, the tide began to turn. In 1975, the Party once
again laid emphasis on greater social discipline and the need to build
an industrial economy so that China could become a power before the
end of the century.
Reforms from 1978
The Cultural Revolution was followed by a process of political
manoeuvring. Deng Xiaoping kept party control strong while introducing
a socialist market economy. In 1978, the Party declared its goal as the
Four Modernisations (to develop science, industry, agriculture, defence).
Debate was allowed as long as the Party was not questioned.
In this new and liberating climate, as at the time of the May Fourth
movement 60 years earlier, there was an exciting explosion of new
ideas. On 5 December 1978, a wall-poster, ‘The Fifth Modernisation’
proclaimed that without Democracy the other modernisations would
come to nothing. It went on to criticise the CCP for not solving the
problem of poverty or ending sexual exploitation, even citing cases of
such abuse from within the Party.

These demands were suppressed, but in 1989
on the seventieth anniversary of the May Fourth
movement many intellectuals called for a greater
openness and an end to ‘ossified dogmas’ (su
shaozhi). Student demonstrators at Tiananmen
Square in Beijing were brutally repressed. This
was strongly condemned around the world.
The post-reform period has seen the
emergence of debates on ways to develop
China. The dominant view supported by the
Party is based on strong political control,
economic liberalisation and integration into
the world market. Critics argue that increasing
inequalities between social groups, between
regions and between men and women are
creating social tensions, and question the
heavy emphasis on the market. Finally, there
is a growing revival of earlier so-called
‘traditional’ ideas, of Confucianism and
arguments that China can build a modern
society following its own traditions rather than
simply copying the West.
The Story of Taiwan
Chiang Kai-shek, defeated by the CCP fled in 1949 to Taiwan with over
US$300 million in gold reserves and crates of priceless art treasures
and established the Republic of China. Taiwan had been a Japanese
colony since the Chinese ceded it after the 1894-95 war with Japan.
The Cairo Declaration (1943) and the Potsdam Proclamation (1949)
restored sovereignty to China.
Massive demonstrations in February 1947 had led the GMD to
brutally kill a whole generation of leading figures. The GMD, under
Chiang Kai-shek went on to establish a repressive government
forbidding free speech and political opposition and excluding the local
population from positions of power. However, they carried out land
reforms that increased agricultural productivity and modernised the
economy so that by 1973 Taiwan had a GNP second only to that of
Japan in Asia. The economy, largely dependent on trade has been
steadily growing, but what is important is that the gap between the
rich and poor has been steadily declining.
Even more dramatic has been the transformation of Taiwan into a
democracy. It began slowly after the death of Chiang in 1975 and grew
in momentum when martial law was lifted in 1987 and opposition
parties were legally permitted. The first free elections began the process
of bringing local Taiwanese to power. Diplomatically most countries
have only trade missions in Taiwan. Full diplomatic relations and

embassies are not possible as Taiwan is considered to be part of China.
The question of re-unification with the mainland remains a
contentious issue but “ Cross Strait” relations (that is between Taiwan
and China) have been improving and Taiwanese trade and investments
in the mainland are massive and travel has also become easier. China
may be willing to tolerate a semi-autonomous Taiwan as long as it
gives up any move to seek independence.
Two Roads to Modernisation
Industrial societies far from becoming like each other have found their
own paths to becoming modern. The histories of Japan and China
show how different historical conditions led them on widely divergent
paths to building independent and modern nations. Japan was
successful in retaining its independence and using traditional skills
and practices in new ways. However, its elite-driven modernisation
generated an aggressive nationalism, helped to sustain a repressive
regime that stifled dissent and demands for democracy, and established
a colonial empire that left a legacy of hatred in the region as well as
distorted internal developments.
Japan’s programme of modernisation was carried out in an
environment dominated by Western imperial powers. While it imitated
them it also attempted to find its own solutions. Japanese nationalism
was marked by these different compulsions – while many Japanese
hoped to liberate Asia from Western domination, for others these ideas
justified building an empire.
It is important to note that the transformation of social and political
institutions and daily life was not just a question of reviving traditions,
or tenaciously preserving them, but rather of creatively using them in
new and different ways. For instance, the Meiji school system, modelled
on European and American practices, introduced new subjects but
the curriculum’s main objective was to make loyal citizens. A course
on morals that stressed loyalty to the emperor was compulsory.
Similarly, changes in the family or in daily life show how foreign and
indigenous ideas were brought together to create something new.
The Chinese path to modernisation was very different. Foreign
imperialism, both Western and Japanese, combined with a hesitant
and unsure Qing dynasty to weaken government control and set the
stage for a breakdown of political and social order leading to immense
misery for most of the people. Warlordism, banditry and civil war exacted
a heavy toll on human lives, as did the savagery of the Japanese
invasion. Natural disasters added to this burden.
The nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw a rejection of traditions
and a search for ways to build national unity and strength. The CCP
and its supporters fought to put an end to tradition, which they saw
as keeping the masses in poverty, the women subjugated and the
country undeveloped. While calling for power to the people, it built a

highly centralised state. The success of the Communist programme
promised hope but its repressive political system turned the ideals of
liberation and equality into slogans to manipulate the people. Yet it did
remove centuries-old inequalities, spread education and raise
consciousness among the people.
The Party has now carried out market reforms and has been
successful in making China economically powerful but its political
system continues to be tightly controlled. The society now faces growing
inequalities, as well as a revival of traditions long suppressed. This new
situation again poses the question of how China can develop while
retaining its heritage.

Conclusion
HIS book on Themes of World History has taken you across vast
stretches of time – ancient, medieval, modern. It has focused on
some of the more prominent themes of human evolution and
development. Each section has covered the following, increasingly
foreshortened, periods:
I  c.6 MYA  – 400 BCE
II  BCE 400 – 1300 CE
III  800 – 1700 CE
IV  1700 – 2000 CE
Although historians tend to specialise in ancient, medieval and
modern periods, the historian’s craft displays certain common features
and predicaments. We have attempted to nuance the distinction between
ancient, medieval and modern in order to convey a holistic idea of how
history is written and discussed as also to equip you with an overall
understanding of human history that goes well beyond our modern
roots.
The book would have allowed you a glimpse into the history of
Africa, West and Central Asia, East Asia, Australia, North and South
America and Europe including the United Kingdom. It would have
familiarised you with what may be called the ‘case study’ method.
Instead of burdening you with enormous detail about the history of all
these places, we felt it would be better to examine key illustrations of
certain phenomena in detail.
World history can be written in many ways. One of these, perhaps
the oldest, is to focus on contact between peoples to stress the
interconnectedness of cultures and civilisations and to explore the
multifarious dimensions of world historical change. An alternative is
to identify relatively self-contained – though expanding – regions of
economic exchange that sustained certain forms of culture and power.
A third method specifies differences in the historical experience of
nations and regions to highlight their distinctive characteristics. You
would have found traces of each of these approaches in the book. But
differences between societies (and individuals) go hand in hand with

similarities. Interlinkages, connections and similarities among human
communities always existed.  The interplay of the global and the local
(‘the world in a grain of sand’), the ‘mainstream’ and the ‘marginal’,
the general and the specific, which you would have gleaned from this
book, are a fascinating aspect of the study of history.
Our account began from scattered settlements in Africa, Asia and
Europe. From there we moved on to city life in Mesopotamia. Early
empires were created around cities in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China,
Persia and India. Empires of greater extent followed them – the Greek
(Macedonian), Roman, Arab and (from the 1200s) the Mongol. Trading
operations, technology and government were often highly intricate in
these empires. Very often, they were based on effective use of a written
language.
A new era in human history took shape as a consequence of a
combination of technological and organisational changes that occurred
in Western Europe in the middle of the second millennium CE (from the
1400s onwards). These were linked to the ‘Renaissance’ or ‘rebirth’ of
civilisation, whose primary impact was felt in the cities of northern
Italy, but whose influence spread quickly over Europe. This Renaissance
was the product of the region’s city life, and of extensive interactions
with Byzantium and the Muslim world of the Mediterranean. Over
time, ideas and discoveries were carried to the Americas by explorers
and conquerors, in the sixteenth century CE. Some of these notions
were carried later to Japan, India and elsewhere as well.
European pre-eminence in global trade, politics and culture did not
come at this time. It was to be the feature of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, when the Industrial Revolution took place in
Britain, and spread to Europe. Britain, France and Germany were
able to create systems of colonial control over parts of Africa and Asia
– systems more intense and powerful than those of earlier empires.
By the mid-twentieth century, the technology, economic life and culture
that had once made European states powerful had been reworked in
the rest of the world to create the foundations of modern life.
You must have noticed passages quoted in the various chapters of
the book. Many of these are extracts for what historians call ‘primary
sources’. Scholars construct history from such materials, drawing their
‘facts’ from them. They critically evaluate these materials and are
attentive to their ambiguities. Different historians may use a given
source-material to advance vastly different, even contradictory
arguments about historical phenomena. As with the other human
sciences, history can be made to speak to us in varied voices. This is
because of the intricate relationship between the historian’s reasoning
and historical facts.
In your final year at school you will be studying aspects of Indian (or
South Asian) history from Harappan times to the making of modern
India’s Constitution. Again, the emphasis will be on a judicious mix of
political, economic, social and cultural history, inviting you to engage

with chosen themes through the case-study method. We hope these
books will help you formulate your own answers to so many questions,
above all to the question,‘Why study History?’ Do you know the gifted
medievalist, Marc Bloch, began his book, The Historian’s Craft, written
in the trenches during the second World War, by recalling a young
boy’s question, ‘Tell me, Daddy. What is the use of history?’
