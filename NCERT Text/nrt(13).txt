2.1 Introduction
You have studied algebraic expressions, their addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division in earlier classes. You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic
expressions. You may recall the algebraic identities :
(x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2
(x – y)2 = x2 – 2xy + y2
x2 – y2 = (x + y) (x – y)
and their use in factorisation. In this chapter, we shall start our study with a particular
type of algebraic expression, called polynomial, and the terminology related to it. We
shall also study the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem and their use in the
factorisation of polynomials. In addition to the above, we shall study some more algebraic
identities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions.
2.2 Polynomials in One Variable
Let us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real
value. We use the letters x, y, z, etc. to denote variables. Notice that 2x, 3x, – x, – 1
are algebraic expressions. All these expressions are of the form (a constant) × x. Now
suppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant) × (a variable) and we do
not know what the constant is. In such cases, we write the constant as a, b, c, etc. So
the expression will be ax, say.
However, there is a difference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter
denoting a variable. The values of the constants remain the same throughout a particular
situation, that is, the values of the constants do not change in a given problem, but the
value of a variable can keep changing.

Now, consider a square of side 3 units (see Fig. 2.1).
What is its perimeter? You know that the perimeter of a square
is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Here, each side is 3
units. So, its perimeter is 4 × 3, i.e., 12 units. What will be the
perimeter if each side of the square is 10 units? The perimeter
is 4 × 10, i.e., 40 units. In case the length of each side is x
units (see Fig. 2.2), the perimeter is given by 4x units. So, as
the length of the side varies, the perimeter varies.
Can you find the area of the square PQRS? It is
x × x = x2 square units. x2 is an algebraic expression. You are
also familiar with other algebraic expressions like
2x, x2 + 2x, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7. Note that, all the algebraic
expressions we have considered so far have only whole
numbers as the exponents of the variable. Expressions of this
form are called polynomials in one variable. In the examples
above, the variable is x. For instance, x3 – x2 + 4x + 7 is a
polynomial in x. Similarly, 3y2 + 5y is a polynomial in the
variable y and t2 + 4 is a polynomial in the variable t.
In the polynomial x2 + 2x, the expressions x2 and 2x are called the terms of the
polynomial. Similarly, the polynomial 3y2 + 5y + 7 has three terms, namely, 3y2, 5y and
7. Can you write the terms of the polynomial –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2 ? This polynomial has
4 terms, namely, –x3, 4x2, 7x and –2.
Each term of a polynomial has a coefficient. So, in –x3 + 4x2 + 7x – 2, the
coefficient of x3 is –1, the coefficient of x2 is 4, the coefficient of x is 7 and –2 is the
coefficient of x0. (Remember, x0 = 1) Do you know the coefficient of x in x2 – x + 7?
It is –1.
2 is also a polynomial. In fact, 2, –5, 7, etc. are examples of constant polynomials.
The constant polynomial 0 is called the zero polynomial. This plays a very important
role in the collection of all polynomials, as you will see in the higher classes.
Now, consider algebraic expressions such as x +
3 and
Do you
know that you can write x + 1
x  = x + x–1? Here, the exponent of the second term, i.e.,
x–1 is –1, which is not a whole number. So, this algebraic expression is not a polynomial.
Again,
can be written as
. Here the exponent of x is 1
2 , which is
not a whole number. So, is
a polynomial? No, it is not. What about
3 y  + y2? It is also not a polynomial (Why?).

If the variable in a polynomial is x, we may denote the polynomial by p(x), or q(x),
or r(x), etc. So, for example, we may write :
p(x) = 2x2 + 5x – 3
q(x) = x3 –1
r(y) = y3 + y + 1
s(u) = 2 – u – u2 + 6u5
A polynomial can have any (finite) number of terms. For instance, x150 + x149 + ...
+ x2 + x + 1 is a polynomial with 151 terms.
Consider the polynomials 2x, 2, 5x3, –5x2, y and u4. Do you see that each of these
polynomials has only one term? Polynomials having only one term are called monomials
(‘mono’ means ‘one’).
Now observe each of the following polynomials:
p(x) = x + 1,
q(x) = x2 – x,
r(y) = y30 + 1,
t(u) = u43 – u2
How many terms are there in each of these? Each of these polynomials has only
two terms. Polynomials having only two terms are called binomials (‘bi’ means ‘two’).
Similarly, polynomials having only three terms are called trinomials
(‘tri’ means ‘three’). Some examples of trinomials are
p(x) = x + x2 +
q(x) =
2  + x – x2,
r(u) = u + u2 – 2,
t(y) = y4 + y + 5.
Now, look at the polynomial p(x) = 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9. What is the term with the
highest power of x ? It is 3x7. The exponent of x in this term is 7. Similarly, in the
polynomial q(y) = 5y6 – 4y2 – 6, the term with the highest power of y is 5y6 and the
exponent of y in this term is 6. We call the highest power of the variable in a polynomial
as the degree of the polynomial. So, the degree of the polynomial 3x7 – 4x6 + x + 9
is 7 and the degree of the polynomial 5y6 – 4y2 – 6 is 6. The degree of a non-zero
constant polynomial is zero.
Example 1 : Find the degree of each of the polynomials given below:
(i) x5 – x4 + 3
(ii) 2 – y2 – y3 + 2y8
(iii) 2
Solution : (i) The highest power of the variable is 5. So, the degree of the polynomial
is 5.
(ii) The highest power of the variable is 8. So, the degree of the polynomial is 8.
(iii) The only term here is 2 which can be written as 2x0. So the exponent of x is 0.
Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 0.

Now observe the polynomials p(x) = 4x + 5, q(y) = 2y, r(t) = t +
2 and
s(u) = 3 – u. Do you see anything common among all of them? The degree of each of
these polynomials is one. A polynomial of degree one is called a linear polynomial.
Some more linear polynomials in one variable are 2x – 1, 2 y + 1, 2 – u. Now, try and
find a linear polynomial in x with 3 terms? You would not be able to find it because a
linear polynomial in x can have at most two terms. So, any linear polynomial in x will
be of the form ax + b, where a and b are constants and a
✂ 0 (why?). Similarly,
ay + b is a linear polynomial in y.
Now consider the polynomials :
2x2 + 5, 5x2 + 3x +
✁, x2 and x2 + 2
Do you agree that they are all of degree two? A polynomial of degree two is called
a quadratic polynomial. Some examples of a quadratic polynomial are 5 – y2,
4y + 5y2 and 6 – y – y2. Can you write a quadratic polynomial in one variable with four
different terms? You will find that a quadratic polynomial in one variable will have at
most 3 terms. If you list a few more quadratic polynomials, you will find that any
quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a
✂ 0 and a, b, c are
constants. Similarly, quadratic polynomial in y will be of the form ay2 + by + c, provided
✂ 0 and a, b, c are constants.
We call a polynomial of degree three a cubic polynomial. Some examples of a
cubic polynomial in x are 4x3, 2x3 + 1, 5x3 + x2, 6x3 – x, 6 – x3, 2x3 + 4x2 + 6x + 7. How
many terms do you think a cubic polynomial in one variable can have? It can have at
most 4 terms. These may be written in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a
✂ 0 and
a, b, c and d are constants.
Now, that you have seen what a polynomial of degree 1, degree 2, or degree 3
looks like, can you write down a polynomial in one variable of degree n for any natural
number n? A polynomial in one variable x of degree n is an expression of the form
anxn + an–1xn–1 + . . . + a1x + a0
where a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an
In particular, if a0 = a1 = a2 = a3 = . . . = an = 0 (all the constants are zero), we get
the zero polynomial, which is denoted by 0. What is the degree of the zero polynomial?
The degree of the zero polynomial is not defined.
So far we have dealt with polynomials in one variable only. We can also have
polynomials in more than one variable. For example, x2 + y2 + xyz (where variables
are x, y and z) is a polynomial in three variables. Similarly p2 + q10 + r (where the
variables are p, q and r), u3 + v2 (where the variables are u and v) are polynomials in
three and two variables, respectively. You will be studying such polynomials in detail
later.

2.3 Zeroes of a Polynomial
Consider the polynomial
p(x) = 5x3 – 2x2 + 3x – 2.
If we replace x by 1 everywhere in p(x), we get
p(1) = 5 × (1)3 – 2 × (1)2 + 3 × (1) – 2
= 5 – 2 + 3 –2
So, we say that the value of p(x) at x = 1 is 4.
Similarly,
p(0) = 5(0)3 – 2(0)2 + 3(0) –2
Can you find p(–1)?
Example 2 : Find the value of each of the following polynomials at the indicated value
of variables:
p(x) = 5x2 – 3x + 7 at x = 1.
(ii) q(y) = 3y3 – 4y +
11  at y = 2.
(iii) p(t) = 4t4 + 5t3 – t2 + 6 at t = a.
POLYNOMIALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
Solution : (i) p(x) = 5x2 – 3x + 7
The value of the polynomial p(x) at x = 1 is given by
p(1) = 5(1)2 – 3(1) + 7
= 5 – 3 + 7 = 9
(ii) q(y) = 3y3 – 4y + 11
The value of the polynomial q(y) at y = 2 is given by
q(2) = 3(2)3 – 4(2) + 11  = 24 – 8 + 11  = 16 + 11
(iii) p(t) = 4t4 + 5t3 – t2 + 6
The value of the polynomial p(t) at t = a is given by
p(a) = 4a4 + 5a3 – a2 + 6
Now, consider the polynomial p(x) = x – 1.
What is p(1)? Note that :  p(1) = 1 – 1 = 0.
As p(1) = 0, we say that 1 is a zero of the polynomial p(x).
Similarly, you can check that 2 is a zero of q(x), where q(x) = x – 2.
In general, we say that a zero of a polynomial p(x) is a number c such that p(c) = 0.
You must have observed that the zero of the polynomial x – 1 is obtained by
equating it to 0, i.e., x – 1 = 0, which gives x = 1. We say p(x) = 0 is a polynomial
equation and 1 is the root of the polynomial equation p(x) = 0. So we say 1 is the zero
of the polynomial x – 1, or a root of the polynomial equation x – 1 = 0.
Now, consider the constant polynomial 5. Can you tell what its zero is? It has no
zero because replacing x by any number in 5x0 still gives us 5. In fact, a non-zero
constant polynomial has no zero. What about the zeroes of the zero polynomial? By
convention, every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial.
Example 3 : Check whether –2 and 2 are zeroes of the polynomial x + 2.
Solution : Let p(x) = x + 2.
Then p(2) = 2 + 2 = 4, p(–2) = –2 + 2 = 0
Therefore, –2 is a zero of the polynomial x + 2, but 2 is not.
Example 4 : Find a zero of the polynomial p(x) = 2x + 1.
Solution : Finding a zero of p(x), is the same as solving the equation
p(x) = 0

2x + 1 = 0 gives us x =
– 2  is a zero of the polynomial 2x + 1.
Now, if p(x) = ax + b, a
✂ 0, is a linear polynomial, how can we find a zero of
p(x)? Example 4 may have given you some idea. Finding a zero of the polynomial p(x),
amounts to solving the polynomial equation p(x) = 0.
Now, p(x) = 0 means
ax + b = 0, a ✂ 0
ax = –b
i.e.,
x = – b
So, x =
  is the only zero of p(x), i.e., a linear polynomial has one and only one zero.
Now we can say that 1 is the zero of x – 1, and –2 is the zero of x + 2.
Example 5 : Verify whether 2 and 0 are zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.
Solution : Let
p(x) = x2 – 2x
p(2) = 22 – 4 = 4 – 4 = 0
p(0) = 0 – 0 = 0
Hence, 2 and 0 are both zeroes of the polynomial x2 – 2x.
Let us now list our observations:
(i) A zero of a polynomial need not be 0.
(ii) 0 may be a zero of a polynomial.
(iii) Every linear polynomial has one and only one zero.
(iv) A polynomial can have more than one zero.

(vi) p(x) = ax, a

✂ 0, c, d are real numbers.
2.4 Remainder Theorem
Let us consider two numbers 15 and 6. You know that when we divide 15 by 6, we get
the quotient 2 and remainder 3. Do you remember how this fact is expressed? We
write 15 as
15 = (2 × 6) + 3
We observe that the remainder 3 is less than the divisor 6. Similarly, if we divide
12 by 6, we get
12 = (2 × 6) + 0
What is the remainder here? Here the remainder is 0, and we say that 6 is a
factor of 12 or 12 is a multiple of 6.
Now, the question is: can we divide one polynomial by another? To start with, let
us try and do this when the divisor is a monomial. So, let us divide the polynomial
2x3 + x2 + x by the monomial x.
We have
(2x3 + x2 + x)
÷ x =
= 2x2 + x + 1
In fact, you may have noticed that x is common to each term of 2x3 + x2 + x. So
we can write 2x3 + x2 + x as x(2x2 + x + 1).
We say that x and 2x2 + x + 1 are factors of 2x3 + x2 + x, and 2x3 + x2 + x is a
multiple of x as well as a multiple of 2x2 + x + 1.

Consider another pair of polynomials 3x2 + x + 1 and x.
Here,
(3x2 + x + 1) ÷ x = (3x2 ÷ x) + (x
÷ x) + (1 ÷ x).
We see that we cannot divide 1 by x to get a polynomial term. So in this case we
stop here, and note that 1 is the remainder. Therefore, we have
3x2 + x + 1 = {(3x + 1) × x} + 1
In this case, 3x + 1 is the quotient and 1 is the remainder. Do you think that x is a
factor of 3x2 + x + 1? Since the remainder is not zero, it is not a factor.
Now let us consider an example to see how we can divide a polynomial by any
non-zero polynomial.
Example 6 : Divide p(x) by g(x), where p(x) = x + 3x2 – 1 and g(x) = 1 + x.
Solution : We carry out the process of division by means of the following steps:
Step 1 : We write the dividend x + 3x2 – 1 and the divisor 1 + x in the standard form,
i.e., after arranging the terms in the descending order of their degrees. So, the
dividend is 3x2 + x –1 and divisor is x + 1.
Step 2 : We divide the first term of the dividend
by the first term of the divisor, i.e., we divide
3x2 by x, and get 3x. This gives us the first term
of the quotient.
Step 3 : We multiply the divisor by the first term
of the quotient, and subtract this product from
the dividend, i.e., we multiply x + 1 by 3x and
subtract the product 3x2 + 3x from the dividend
3x2 + x – 1. This gives us the remainder as
–2x – 1.
Step 4 : We treat the remainder –2x – 1
as the new dividend. The divisor remains
the same. We repeat Step 2 to get the
next term of the quotient, i.e., we divide
the first term – 2x of the (new) dividend
by the first term x of the divisor and obtain
– 2. Thus, – 2 is the second term in the
quotient.
x = 3x = first term of quotient
= – 2
= second term of quotient
New Quotient
= 3x – 2
3x2 +  x –1
3x2 + 3x
– 2x – 1
x + 1
POLYNOMIALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
Step 5 : We multiply the divisor by the second
term of the quotient and subtract the product
from the dividend. That is, we multiply x + 1
by – 2 and subtract the product – 2x – 2
from the dividend – 2x – 1. This gives us 1
as the remainder.
This process continues till the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the
divisor. At this stage, this new dividend becomes the remainder and the sum of the
quotients gives us the whole quotient.
Step 6 : Thus, the quotient in full is 3x – 2 and the remainder is 1.
Let us look at what we have done in the process above as a whole:
3x – 2
x + 1
3x2 + x – 1
3x2 + 3x
–    –
– 2x – 1
– 2x – 2
Notice that 3x2 + x – 1 = (x + 1) (3x – 2) + 1
i.e.,
Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder
In general, if p(x) and g(x) are two polynomials such that degree of p(x)
✄ degree of
g(x) and g(x)
✂ 0, then we can find polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that:
p(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x),
where r(x) = 0 or degree of r(x) < degree of g(x). Here we say that p(x) divided by
g(x), gives q(x) as quotient and r(x) as remainder.
In the example above, the divisor was a linear polynomial. In such a situation, let us
see if there is any link between the remainder and certain values of the dividend.
p(x) = 3x2 + x – 1, if we replace x by –1, we have
p(–1) = 3(–1)2 + (–1) –1 = 1
So, the remainder obtained on dividing p(x) = 3x2 + x – 1 by x + 1 is the same as the
value of the polynomial p(x) at the zero of the polynomial x + 1, i.e., –1.
(x + 1)(–2) –2x – 1
= –2x – 2
–2x – 2

Let us consider some more examples.
Example 7 : Divide the polynomial 3x4 – 4x3 – 3x –1 by x – 1.
Solution : By long division, we have:
3x3 – x2 – x – 4
x – 1
3x4 – 4x3 – 3x – 1
–3x4 –+ 3x3
–   x3
– 3x – 1
–+   x3 +– x2
– x2 – 3x – 1
– +x2 +– x
– 4x – 1
– +4x +– 4
Here, the remainder is – 5. Now, the zero of x – 1 is 1. So, putting x = 1 in p(x), we see
p(1) = 3(1)4 – 4(1)3 – 3(1) – 1
= 3 – 4 – 3 – 1
= – 5, which is the remainder.

Solution : By long division,
x2 – x + 1
x + 1
x3 + 1

So, we find that the remainder is 0.
Here p(x) = x3 + 1, and the root of x + 1 = 0
x = –1. We see that
p(–1) = (–1)3 + 1
= –1 + 1
which is equal to the remainder obtained by actual division.
Is it not a simple way to find the remainder obtained on dividing a polynomial by a
linear polynomial? We shall now generalise this fact in the form of the following
theorem. We shall also show you why the theorem is true, by giving you a proof of the
theorem.
Remainder Theorem : Let p(x) be any polynomial of degree greater than or
equal to one and let a be any real number. If p(x) is divided by the linear
polynomial x – a, then the remainder is p(a).
Proof : Let p(x) be any polynomial with degree greater than or equal to 1. Suppose
that when p(x) is divided by x – a, the quotient is q(x) and the remainder is r(x), i.e.,
p(x) = (x – a) q(x) + r(x)
Since the degree of x – a is 1 and the degree of r(x) is less than the degree of x – a,
the degree of r(x) = 0. This means that r(x) is a constant, say r.
So, for every value of x, r(x) = r.
Therefore,
p(x) = (x – a) q(x) + r
In particular, if x = a, this equation gives us
p(a) = (a – a) q(a) + r
which proves the theorem.
Let us use this result in another example.
Example 9 : Find the remainder when x4 + x3 – 2x2 + x + 1 is divided by x – 1.
Solution : Here,
p(x) = x4 + x3 – 2x2 + x + 1, and the zero of x – 1 is 1.
p(1) = (1)4 + (1)3 – 2(1)2 + 1 + 1
So, by the Remainder Theorem, 2 is the remainder when x4 + x3 – 2x2 + x + 1 is
divided by x – 1.
Example 10 : Check whether the polynomial q(t) = 4t3 + 4t2 – t – 1 is a multiple of
2t + 1.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
Solution : As you know, q(t) will be a multiple of 2t + 1 only, if 2t + 1 divides q(t)
leaving remainder zero. Now, taking 2t + 1 = 0, we have t =
Also,
✍ = 0
So the remainder obtained on dividing q(t) by 2t + 1 is 0.
So, 2t + 1 is a factor of the given polynomial q(t), that is q(t) is a multiple of
2t + 1.
EXERCISE 2.3

x + 1
(ii) x – 1
(iii) x
(iv) x +
(v) 5 +  2x
Find the remainder when x3 – ax2 + 6x – a is divided by x – a.
Check whether 7 + 3x is a factor of 3x3 + 7x.
2.5 Factorisation of Polynomials
Let us now look at the situation of Example 10 above more closely. It tells us that since
the remainder,
✗ = 0, (2t + 1) is a factor of q(t), i.e., q(t) = (2t + 1) g(t)
for some polynomial g(t). This is a particular case of the following theorem.
Factor Theorem : If p(x) is a polynomial of degree n > 1 and a is any real number,
(i) x – a is a factor of p(x), if p(a) = 0, and
(ii) p(a) = 0, if x – a is a factor of p(x).
This actually follows immediately from the Remainder Theorem, but we shall not
prove it here. However, we shall apply it quite a bit, as in the following examples.
Example 11 : Examine whether x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and of 2x + 4.
Solution : The zero of x + 2 is –2. Let p(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6 and s(x) = 2x + 4
Then,
p(–2) = (–2)3 + 3(–2)2 + 5(–2) + 6
POLYNOMIALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
= –8 + 12 – 10 + 6
So, by the Factor Theorem, x + 2 is a factor of x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 6.
Again,
s(–2) = 2(–2) + 4 = 0
So, x + 2 is a factor of 2x + 4. In fact, you can check this without applying the Factor
Theorem, since 2x + 4 = 2(x + 2).
Example 12 : Find the value of k, if x – 1 is a factor of 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k.
Solution : As x – 1 is a factor of p(x) = 4x3 + 3x2 – 4x + k, p(1) = 0
p(1) = 4(1)3 + 3(1)2 – 4(1) + k
4 + 3 – 4 + k = 0
i.e.,
k = –3
We will now use the Factor Theorem to factorise some polynomials of degree 2 and 3.
You are already familiar with the factorisation of a quadratic polynomial like
x2 + lx + m. You had factorised it by splitting the middle term lx as ax + bx so that
ab = m. Then x2 + lx + m = (x + a) (x + b). We shall now try to factorise quadratic
polynomials of the type ax2 + bx + c, where a
✂ 0 and a, b, c are constants.
Factorisation of the polynomial ax2 + bx + c by splitting the middle term is as
follows:
Let its factors be (px + q) and (rx + s). Then
ax2 + bx + c = (px + q) (rx + s) = pr x2 + (ps + qr) x + qs
Comparing the coefficients of x2, we get a = pr.
Similarly, comparing the coefficients of x, we get b = ps + qr.
And, on comparing the constant terms, we get c = qs.
This shows us that b is the sum of two numbers ps and qr, whose product is
(ps)(qr) = (pr)(qs) = ac.
Therefore, to factorise ax2 + bx + c, we have to write b as the sum of two
numbers whose product is ac. This will be clear from Example 13.
Example 13 : Factorise 6x2 + 17x + 5 by splitting the middle term, and by using the
Factor Theorem.
Solution 1 : (By splitting method) : If we can find two numbers p and q such that
p + q = 17
pq = 6 × 5 = 30, then we can get the factors.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
So, let us look for the pairs of factors of 30. Some are 1 and 30, 2 and 15, 3 and 10, 5
and 6. Of these pairs, 2 and 15 will give us p + q = 17.
So, 6x2 + 17x + 5 = 6x2 + (2 + 15)x + 5
= 6x2 + 2x + 15x + 5
= 2x(3x + 1) + 5(3x + 1)
= (3x + 1) (2x + 5)
Solution 2 : (Using the Factor Theorem)
6x2 + 17x + 5 =
= 6 p(x), say. If a and b are the zeroes of p(x), then
6x2 + 17x + 5 = 6(x – a) (x – b). So, ab = 5.
6  Let us look at some possibilities for a and
b. They could be
✞. Now,
✠ 0. But
= 0. So,
✑ is a factor of p(x). Similarly, by trial, you can find that
is a factor of p(x).
Therefore,
6x2 + 17x + 5 = 6
= (3x + 1) (2x + 5)
For the example above, the use of the splitting method appears more efficient. However,
let us consider another example.
Example 14 : Factorise y2 – 5y + 6 by using the Factor Theorem.
Solution : Let p(y) = y2 – 5y + 6. Now, if p(y) = (y – a) (y – b), you know that the
constant term will be ab. So, ab = 6. So, to look for the factors of p(y), we look at the
factors of 6.
The factors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.
p(2) = 22 – (5 × 2) + 6 = 0
POLYNOMIALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
y – 2 is a factor of p(y).
Also,
p(3) = 32 – (5 × 3) + 6 = 0
y – 3 is also a factor of y2 – 5y + 6.
Therefore,
y2 – 5y + 6 = (y – 2)(y – 3)
Note that y2 – 5y + 6 can also be factorised by splitting the middle term –5y.
Now, let us consider factorising cubic polynomials. Here, the splitting method will not
be appropriate to start with. We need to find at least one factor first, as you will see in
the following example.
Example 15 : Factorise x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120.
Solution : Let
p(x) = x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120
We shall now look for all the factors of –120. Some of these are ±1, ±2, ±3,
±4, ±5, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12, ±15, ±20, ±24, ±30, ±60.
By trial, we find that p(1) = 0. So x – 1 is a factor of p(x).
Now we see that x3 – 23x2 + 142x – 120 = x3 – x2 – 22x2 + 22x + 120x – 120
= x2(x –1) – 22x(x – 1) + 120(x – 1)
(Why?)
= (x – 1) (x2 – 22x + 120)
[Taking (x – 1) common]
We could have also got this by dividing p(x) by x – 1.
Now x2 – 22x + 120 can be factorised either by splitting the middle term or by using
the Factor theorem. By splitting the middle term, we have:
x2 – 22x + 120 = x2 – 12x – 10x + 120
= x(x – 12) – 10(x – 12)
= (x – 12) (x – 10)
x3 – 23x2 – 142x – 120 = (x – 1)(x – 10)(x – 12)

2.6 Algebraic Identities
From your earlier classes, you may recall that an algebraic identity is an algebraic
equation that is true for all values of the variables occurring in it. You have studied the
following algebraic identities in earlier classes:
Identity I
: (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2
Identity II
: (x – y)2 = x2 – 2xy + y2
Identity III : x2 – y2 = (x + y) (x – y)
Identity IV : (x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a + b)x + ab
You must have also used some of these algebraic identities to factorise the algebraic
expressions. You can also see their utility in computations.
Example 16 : Find the following products using appropriate identities:
(i) (x + 3) (x + 3)
(ii) (x – 3) (x + 5)
Solution : (i) Here we can use Identity I : (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2. Putting y = 3 in it,
we get
(x + 3) (x + 3) = (x + 3)2 = x2 + 2(x)(3) + (3)2
= x2 + 6x + 9
(ii) Using Identity IV above, i.e., (x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a + b)x + ab, we have
(x – 3) (x + 5) = x2 + (–3 + 5)x + (–3)(5)
= x2 + 2x – 15

Example 17 : Evaluate 105 × 106 without multiplying directly.
Solution :
105 × 106 = (100 + 5) × (100 + 6)
= (100)2 + (5 + 6) (100) + (5 × 6), using Identity IV
= 10000 + 1100 + 30
= 11130
You have seen some uses of the identities listed above in finding the product of some
given expressions. These identities are useful in factorisation of algebraic expressions
also, as you can see in the following examples.
Example 18 : Factorise:
(i) 49a2 + 70ab + 25b2
 Solution : (i) Here you can see that
49a2 = (7a)2, 25b2 = (5b)2, 70ab = 2(7a) (5b)
Comparing the given expression with x2 + 2xy + y2, we observe that x = 7a and y = 5b.
Using Identity I, we get
49a2 + 70ab + 25b2 = (7a + 5b)2 = (7a + 5b) (7a + 5b)
(ii) We have
Now comparing it with Identity III, we get
So far, all our identities involved products of binomials. Let us now extend the Identity
I to a trinomial x + y + z. We shall compute (x + y + z)2 by using Identity I.
Let x + y = t. Then,
(x + y + z)2 = (t + z)2
= t2 + 2tz + t2
(Using Identity I)
= (x + y)2 + 2(x + y)z + z2
(Substituting the value of t)
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
= x2 + 2xy + y2 + 2xz + 2yz + z2
(Using Identity I)
= x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx
(Rearranging the terms)
So, we get the following identity:
Identity V : (x + y + z)2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx
Remark : We call the right hand side expression the expanded form of the left hand
side expression. Note that the expansion of (x + y + z)2 consists of three square terms
and three product terms.
Example 19 : Write (3a + 4b + 5c)2 in expanded form.
Solution : Comparing the given expression with (x + y + z)2, we find that
x = 3a, y = 4b and z = 5c.
Therefore, using Identity V, we have
(3a + 4b + 5c)2 = (3a)2 + (4b)2 + (5c)2 + 2(3a)(4b) + 2(4b)(5c) + 2(5c)(3a)
= 9a2 + 16b2 + 25c2 + 24ab + 40bc + 30ac
Example 20 : Expand (4a – 2b – 3c)2.
Solution : Using Identity V, we have
(4a – 2b – 3c)2 = [4a + (–2b) + (–3c)]2
= (4a)2 + (–2b)2 + (–3c)2 + 2(4a)(–2b) + 2(–2b)(–3c) + 2(–3c)(4a)
= 16a2 + 4b2 + 9c2 – 16ab + 12bc – 24ac
Example 21 : Factorise 4x2 + y2 + z2 – 4xy – 2yz + 4xz.
Solution : We have 4x2 + y2 + z2 – 4xy – 2yz + 4xz = (2x)2 + (–y)2 + (z)2 + 2(2x)(–y)
+ 2(–y)(z) + 2(2x)(z)
= [2x + (–y) + z]2
(Using Identity V)
= (2x – y + z)2 = (2x – y + z)(2x – y + z)
So far, we have dealt with identities involving second degree terms. Now let us
extend Identity I to compute (x + y)3. We have:
(x + y)3 = (x + y) (x + y)2
= (x + y)(x2 + 2xy + y2)
= x(x2 + 2xy + y2) + y(x2 + 2xy + y2)
= x3 + 2x2y + xy2 + x2y + 2xy2 + y3
= x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3
= x3 + y3 + 3xy(x + y)

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-2\Chap-2 (02-01-2006) PM65
So, we get the following identity:
Identity VI :
(x + y)3 = x3 + y3 + 3xy (x + y)
Also, by replacing y by –y in the Identity VI, we get
Identity VII :
(x – y)3 = x3 – y3 – 3xy(x – y)
= x3 – 3x2y + 3xy2 – y3
Example 22 : Write the following cubes in the expanded form:
(i) (3a + 4b)3
(ii) (5p – 3q)3
Solution : (i) Comparing the given expression with (x + y)3, we find that
x = 3a and y = 4b.
So, using Identity VI, we have:
(3a + 4b)3 = (3a)3 + (4b)3 + 3(3a)(4b)(3a + 4b)
= 27a3 + 64b3 + 108a2b + 144ab2
(ii) Comparing the given expression with (x – y)3, we find that
x = 5p, y = 3q.
So, using Identity VII, we have:
(5p – 3q)3 = (5p)3 – (3q)3 – 3(5p)(3q)(5p – 3q)
= 125p3 – 27q3 – 225p2q + 135pq2
Example 23 : Evaluate each of the following using suitable identities:
(i) (104)3
(ii) (999)3
Solution : (i) We have
(104)3 = (100 + 4)3
= (100)3 + (4)3 + 3(100)(4)(100 + 4)
(Using Identity VI)
= 1000000 + 64 + 124800
= 1124864
(ii) We have
(999)3 = (1000 – 1)3
= (1000)3 – (1)3 – 3(1000)(1)(1000 – 1)
(Using Identity VII)
= 1000000000 – 1 – 2997000

Example 24 : Factorise 8x3 + 27y3 + 36x2y + 54xy2
Solution : The given expression can be written as

= (2x)3 + (3y)3 + 3(2x)2(3y) + 3(2x)(3y)2
= (2x + 3y)3
(Using Identity VI)
= (2x + 3y)(2x + 3y)(2x + 3y)
Now consider (x + y + z)(x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx)
On expanding, we get the product as
x(x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx) + y(x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx)
+ z(x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx) = x3 + xy2 + xz2 – x2y – xyz – zx2 + x2y
+ y3 + yz2 – xy2 – y2z – xyz + x2z + y2z + z3 – xyz – yz2 – xz2
= x3 + y3 + z3 – 3xyz
(On simplification)
So, we obtain the following identity:
Identity VIII : x3 + y3 + z3 – 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx)
Example 25 : Factorise : 8x3 + y3 + 27z3 – 18xyz

2.7 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
A polynomial p(x) in one variable x is an algebraic expression in x of the form
p(x) = anxn + an–1xn – 1 + . . . + a2x2 + a1x + a0,
where a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are constants and an
a0, a1, a2, . . ., an are respectively the coefficients of x0, x, x2, . . ., xn, and n is called the degree

A polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic polynomial.
A polynomial of degree three is called a cubic polynomial.
A real number ‘a’ is a zero of a polynomial p(x) if p(a) = 0. In this case, a is also called a root
of the equation p(x) = 0.
Every linear polynomial in one variable has a unique zero, a non-zero constant polynomial
has no zero, and every real number is a zero of the zero polynomial.
10. Remainder Theorem : If p(x) is any polynomial of degree greater than or equal to 1 and p(x)
is divided by the linear polynomial x – a, then the remainder is p(a).
Factor Theorem : x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), if p(a) = 0. Also, if x – a is a factor
of p(x), then p(a) = 0.
12. (x + y + z)2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xy + 2yz + 2zx
13. (x + y)3 = x3 + y3 + 3xy(x + y)
14. (x – y)3 = x3 – y3 – 3xy(x – y)
15. x3 + y3 + z3 – 3xyz = (x + y + z) (x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx)

3.1 Introduction
You have already studied how to locate a point on a number line. You also know how
to describe the position of a point on the line. There are many other situations, in which
to find a point we are required to describe its position with reference to more than one
line. For example, consider the following situations:
I. In Fig. 3.1, there is a main road running
in the East-West direction and streets with
numbering from West to East. Also, on each
street, house numbers are marked. To look for
a friend’s house here, is it enough to know only
one reference point? For instance, if we only
know that she lives on Street 2, will we be able
to find her house easily? Not as easily as when
we know two pieces of information about it,
namely, the number of the street on which it is
situated, and the house number. If we want to
reach the house which is situated in the 2nd
street and has the number 5, first of all we
would identify the 2nd street and then the house
numbered 5 on it. In Fig. 3.1, H shows the
location of the house. Similarly, P shows the
location of the house corresponding to Street
number 7 and House number 4.

II. Suppose you put a dot on a sheet of paper [Fig.3.2 (a)]. If we ask you to tell us
the position of the dot on the paper, how will you do this? Perhaps you will try in some
such manner: “The dot is in the upper half of the paper”, or “It is near the left edge of
the paper”, or “It is very near the left hand upper corner of the sheet”. Do any of
these statements fix the position of the dot precisely? No! But, if you say “ The dot is
nearly 5 cm away from the left edge of the paper”, it helps to give some idea but still
does not fix the position of the dot. A little thought might enable you to say that the dot
is also at a distance of 9 cm above the bottom line. We now know exactly where the dot is!
Fig. 3.2
For this purpose, we fixed the position of the dot by specifying its distances from two
fixed lines, the left edge of the paper and the bottom line of the paper [Fig.3.2 (b)]. In
other words, we need two independent informations for finding the position of the dot.
Now, perform the following classroom activity known as ‘Seating Plan’.
Activity 1 (Seating Plan) : Draw a plan of the seating in your classroom, pushing all
the desks together. Represent each desk by a square. In each square, write the name
of the student occupying the desk, which the square represents. Position of each
student in the classroom is described precisely by using two independent informations:
(i) the column in which she or he sits,
(ii) the row in which she or he sits.
If you are sitting on the desk lying in the 5th column and 3rd row (represented by
the shaded square in Fig. 3.3), your position could be written as (5, 3), first writing the
column number, and then the row number. Is this the same as (3, 5)? Write down the
names and positions of other students in your class. For example, if Sonia is sitting in
the 4th column and 1st row, write S(4,1). The teacher’s desk is not part of your seating
plan. We are treating the teacher just as an observer.

Fig. 3.3
In the discussion above, you observe that position of any object lying in a plane
can be represented with the help of two perpendicular lines. In case of ‘dot’, we
require distance of the dot from bottom line as well as from left edge of the paper. In
case of seating plan, we require the number of the column and that of the row. This
simple idea has far reaching consequences, and has given rise to a very important
branch of Mathematics known as Coordinate Geometry. In this chapter, we aim to
introduce some basic concepts of coordinate geometry. You will study more about
these in your higher classes. This study was initially developed by the French philosopher
and mathematician René Déscartes.
René Déscartes, the great French mathematician of the
seventeenth century, liked to lie in bed and think! One
day, when resting in bed, he solved the problem of
describing the position of a point in a plane. His method
was a development of the older idea of latitude and
longitude. In honour of Déscartes, the system used for
describing the position of a point in a plane is also
known as the Cartesian system.
EXERCISE 3.1
How will you describe the position of a table lamp on your study table to another

city. These two roads are along the North-South direction and East-West direction.

All the other streets of the city run parallel to these roads and are 200 m apart. There
are about 5 streets in each direction. Using 1cm = 200 m, draw a model of the city on
your notebook. Represent the roads/streets by single lines.
There are many cross- streets in your model. A particular cross-street is made by
two streets, one running in the North - South direction and another in the East - West
direction. Each cross street is referred to in the following manner : If the 2nd street
running in the North - South direction and 5th in the East - West direction meet at some
crossing, then we will call this cross-street (2, 5). Using this convention, find:
how many cross - streets can be referred to as (4, 3).
(ii) how many cross - streets can be referred to as (3, 4).
3.2 Cartesian System
You have studied the number line in the chapter on ‘Number System’. On the number
line, distances from a fixed point are marked in equal units positively in one direction
and negatively in the other. The point from which the distances are marked is called
the origin. We use the number line to represent the numbers by marking points on a
line at equal distances. If one unit distance represents the number ‘1’, then 3 units
distance represents the number ‘3’, ‘0’ being at the origin. The point in the positive
direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number r. The point in the
negative direction at a distance r from the origin represents the number
❾r. Locations
of different numbers on the number line are shown in Fig. 3.5.
Fig. 3.5
Descartes invented the idea of placing two such lines perpendicular to each other
on a plane, and locating points on the plane by referring them to these lines. The
perpendicular lines may be in any direction such as in Fig.3.6. But, when we choose
Fig. 3.6
COORDINATE GEOMETRY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
these two lines to locate a point in a plane in this chapter, one line
will be horizontal and the other will be vertical, as in Fig. 3.6(c).
These lines are actually obtained as follows : Take two number
lines, calling them X✁X and Y✁Y. Place X✁X horizontal [as in Fig. 3.7(a)]
and write the numbers on it just as written on the number line. We do
the same thing with Y✁Y except that Y✁Y is vertical, not horizontal
[Fig. 3.7(b)].
Fig. 3.7
Combine both the lines in such
a way that the two lines cross each
other at their zeroes, or origins
(Fig. 3.8). The horizontal line X✁X
is called the x - axis and the vertical
line Y
✁Y is called the y - axis. The
point where X✁X and Y
✁Y cross is
called the origin, and is denoted
by O. Since the positive numbers
lie on the directions OX and OY,
OX and OY are called the positive
directions of the x - axis and the
y - axis, respectively. Similarly, OX
and OY
✁ are called the negative
directions of the x - axis and the
y - axis, respectively.
Fig. 3.8
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
You observe that the axes (plural of the word
‘axis’) divide the plane into four parts. These four
parts are called the quadrants (one fourth part),
numbered I, II, III and IV anticlockwise from OX
(see Fig.3.9). So, the plane consists of the axes and
these quadrants. We call the plane, the Cartesian
plane, or the coordinate plane, or the xy-plane.
The axes are called the coordinate axes.
Now, let us see why this system is so basic to mathematics, and how it is useful.
Consider the following diagram where the axes are drawn on graph paper. Let us see
the distances of the points P and Q from the axes. For this, we draw perpendiculars
PM on the x - axis and PN on the y - axis. Similarly, we draw perpendiculars QR and
QS as shown in Fig. 3.10.
Fig.3.10
You find that
(i) The perpendicular distance of the point P from the y - axis measured along the
positive direction of the x - axis is PN = OM = 4 units.
(ii) The perpendicular distance of the point P from the x - axis measured along the
positive direction of the y - axis is PM = ON = 3 units.
Fig. 3.9
COORDINATE GEOMETRY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
(iii) The perpendicular distance of the point Q from the y - axis measured along
the negative direction of the x - axis is OR = SQ = 6 units.
(iv) The perpendicular distance of the point Q from the x - axis measured along
the negative direction of the y - axis is OS = RQ = 2 units.
Now, using these distances, how can we describe the points so that there is no
confusion?
We write the coordinates of a point,  using the following conventions:
(i) The x - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the y - axis
measured along the x -axis (positive along the positive direction of the x - axis
and negative along the negative direction of the x - axis). For the point P, it is
+ 4 and for Q, it is – 6. The x - coordinate is also called the abscissa.
(ii) The y - coordinate of a point is its perpendicular distance from the x - axis
measured along the y - axis (positive along the positive direction of the y - axis
and negative along the negative direction of the y - axis). For the point P, it is
+ 3 and for Q, it is –2. The y - coordinate is also called the ordinate.
(iii) In stating the coordinates of a point in the coordinate plane, the x - coordinate
comes first, and then the y - coordinate. We place the coordinates in brackets.
Hence, the coordinates of P are (4, 3) and the coordinates of Q are (– 6, – 2).
Note that the coordinates describe a point in the plane uniquely. (3, 4) is not the
same as (4, 3).
Example 1 : See Fig. 3.11 and complete the following statements:
The abscissa and the ordinate of the point B are _ _ _ and _ _ _, respectively.
Hence, the coordinates of B are (_ _, _ _).
The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point M are _ _ _ and _ _ _,
respectively. Hence, the coordinates of M are (_ _, _ _).
(iii) The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point L are _ _ _ and _ _ _,
respectively. Hence, the coordinates of L are (_ _, _ _).
(iv) The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the point S are _ _ _ and _ _ _,
respectively. Hence, the coordinates of S are (_ _, _ _).
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
Fig. 3.11
Solution : (i) Since the distance of the point B from the y - axis is 4 units, the
x - coordinate or abscissa of the point B is 4. The distance of the point B from the
x - axis is 3 units; therefore, the y - coordinate, i.e., the ordinate, of the point B is 3.
Hence, the coordinates of the point B are (4, 3).
As in (i) above :
The x - coordinate and the y - coordinate of the point M are –3 and 4, respectively.
Hence, the coordinates of the point M are (–3, 4).
(iii) The x - coordinate and the y - coordinate of the point L are –5 and  – 4, respectively.
Hence, the coordinates of the point L are (–5, – 4).
(iv) The x - coordinate and the y- coordinate of the point S are 3 and  – 4, respectively.
Hence, the coordinates of the point S are (3, – 4).

Example 2 : Write the coordinates of the
points marked on the axes in Fig. 3.12.
Solution : You can see that :
(i) The point A is at a distance of + 4 units
from the y - axis and at a distance zero
from the x - axis. Therefore, the
x - coordinate of A is 4 and the
y - coordinate is 0. Hence, the
coordinates of A are (4, 0).
(ii) The coordinates of B are (0, 3). Why?
(iii) The coordinates of C are (– 5, 0).
(iv) The coordinates of D are (0, – 4). Why?
(v) The coordinates of E are
✆. Why?
Since every point on the x - axis has no distance (zero distance) from the x - axis,
therefore, the y - coordinate of every point lying on the x - axis is always zero. Thus, the
coordinates of any point on the x - axis are of the form (x, 0), where x is the distance of
the point from the y - axis. Similarly, the coordinates of any point on the y - axis are of
the form (0, y), where y is the distance of the point from the x - axis. Why?
What are the coordinates of the origin O? It has zero distance from both the
axes so that its abscissa and ordinate are both zero. Therefore, the coordinates of
the origin are (0, 0).
In the examples above, you may have observed the following relationship between
the signs of the coordinates of a point and the quadrant of a point in which it lies.
If a point is in the 1st quadrant, then the point will be in the form (+, +), since the
1st quadrant is enclosed by the positive x - axis and the positive y - axis.
If a point is in the 2nd quadrant, then the point will be in the form (–, +), since the
2nd quadrant is enclosed by the negative x - axis and the positive y - axis.
(iii) If a point is in the 3rd quadrant, then the point will be in the form (–, –), since the
3rd quadrant is enclosed by the negative x - axis and the negative y - axis.
(iv) If a point is in the 4th quadrant, then the point will be in the form (+, –), since the
4th quadrant is enclosed by the positive x - axis and the negative y - axis
(see Fig. 3.13).

Remark : The system we have discussed above for describing a point in a plane is
only a convention, which is accepted all over the world. The system could also have
been, for example, the ordinate first, and the abscissa second. However, the whole
world sticks to the system we have described to avoid any confusion.

3.3 Plotting a Point in the Plane if its Coordinates are Given
Uptil now we have drawn the points for you, and asked you to give their coordinates.
Now we will show you how we place these points in the plane if we know its coordinates.
We call this process “plotting the point”.
Let the coordinates of a point be (3, 5). We want to plot this point in the coordinate
plane. We draw the coordinate axes, and choose our units such that one centimetre
represents one unit on both the axes. The coordinates of the point (3, 5) tell us that the
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
distance of this point from the y - axis along the positive x - axis is 3 units and the
distance of the point from the x - axis along the positive y - axis is 5 units. Starting from
the origin O, we count 3 units on the positive x - axis and mark the corresponding point
as A. Now, starting from A, we move in the positive direction of the y - axis and count
5 units and mark the corresponding point as P (see Fig.3.15). You see that the distance
of P from the y - axis is 3 units and from the x - axis is 5 units. Hence, P is the position
of the point. Note that P lies in the 1st quadrant, since both the coordinates of P are
positive. Similarly, you can plot the point Q (5, – 4) in the coordinate plane. The distance
of Q from the x - axis is 4 units along the negative y - axis, so that its y - coordinate is
– 4 (see Fig.3.15). The point Q lies in the 4th quadrant. Why?
Fig. 3.15
Example 3 : Locate the points (5, 0), (0, 5), (2, 5), (5, 2), (–3, 5), (–3, –5), (5, –3) and
(6, 1) in the Cartesian plane.
Solution : Taking 1cm = 1unit, we draw the x - axis and the y - axis. The positions of
the points are shown by dots in Fig.3.16.
COORDINATE GEOMETRY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
Fig. 3.16
Note : In the example above, you see that (5, 0) and (0, 5) are not at the same
position. Similarly, (5, 2) and (2, 5) are at different positions. Also, (–3, 5) and (5, –3)
are at different positions. By taking several such examples, you will find that, if x
then the position of (x, y) in the Cartesian plane is different from the position
of (y, x). So, if we interchange the coordinates x and y, the position of (y, x) will differ
from the position of (x, y). This means that the order of x and y is important in (x, y).
Therefore, (x, y) is called an ordered pair. The ordered pair (x, y)
✂ ordered pair (y, x),
✂ y. Also (x, y) = (y, x), if x = y.
Example 4 : Plot the following ordered pairs of number (x, y) as points in the Cartesian
plane. Use the scale 1cm = 1 unit on the axes.

Solution : The pairs of numbers given in the table can be represented by the points
(– 3, 7), (0, –3.5), (– 1, – 3), (4, 4) and (2, – 3). The locations of the points are shown
by dots in Fig.3.17.
Fig. 3.17
Activity 2 : A game for two persons (Requirements: two counters or coins, graph
paper, two dice of different colours, say red and green):
Place each counter at (0, 0). Each player throws two dice simultaneously. When
the first player does so, suppose the red die shows 3 and the green one shows 1. So,
she moves her counter to (3, 1). Similarly, if the second player throws 2 on the red and
4 on the green, she moves her counter to (2, 4). On the second throw, if the first player
throws 1 on the red and 4 on the green, she moves her counter from (3, 1) to
(3 + 1, 1 + 4), that is, adding 1 to the x - coordinate and 4 to the y - coordinate of (3, 1).
The purpose of the game is to arrive first at (10, 10) without overshooting, i.e.,
neither the abscissa nor the ordinate can be greater than 10. Also, a counter should not
coincide with the position held by another counter. For example, if the first player’s
COORDINATE GEOMETRY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-3\Chap-3 (02-01-2006) PM65
counter moves on to a point already occupied by the counter of the second player, then
the second player’s counter goes to (0, 0). If a move is not possible without overshooting,
the player misses that turn. You can extend this game to play with more friends.
Remark : Plotting of points in the Cartesian plane can be compared to some extent
with drawing of graphs in different situations such as Time-Distance Graph, Side-
Perimeter Graph, etc which you have come across in earlier classes. In such situations,
we may call the axes, t-axis, d-axis, s-axis or p-axis, etc. in place of the
x and y axes.

Plot the points (x, y) given in the following table on the plane, choosing suitable units

3.4 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points :
To locate the position of an object or a point in a plane, we require two perpendicular
lines. One of them is horizontal, and the other is vertical.
The plane is called the Cartesian, or coordinate plane and the lines are called the coordinate
axes.
The horizontal line is called the x -axis, and the vertical line is called the y - axis.
The coordinate axes divide the plane into four parts called quadrants.
The point of intersection of the axes is called the origin.
The distance of a point from the y - axis is called its x-coordinate, or abscissa, and the
distance of the point from the x-axis is called its y-coordinate, or ordinate.
If the abscissa of a point is x and the ordinate is y, then (x, y) are called the coordinates of
the point.
The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form (x, 0) and that of the point on the
y-axis are (0, y).
The coordinates of the origin are (0, 0).
10. The coordinates of a point are of the form (+ , +) in the first quadrant, (–, +) in the second
quadrant, (–, –) in the third quadrant and (+, –) in the fourth quadrant, where + denotes a
positive real number and – denotes a negative real number.
✂ y, then (x, y)
✂ (y, x), and (x, y) = (y, x), if x = y.

CHAPTER 4
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
The principal use of the Analytic Art is to bring Mathematical Problems to
Equations and to exhibit those Equations in the most simple terms that can be.
—Edmund Halley
4.1 Introduction
In earlier classes, you have studied linear equations in one variable. Can you write
down a linear equation in one variable? You may say that x + 1 = 0, x +
2  = 0 and
2 y + 3  = 0 are examples of linear equations in one variable. You also know that
such equations have a unique (i.e., one and only one) solution. You may also remember
how to represent the solution on a number line. In this chapter, the knowledge of linear
equations in one variable shall be recalled and extended to that of two variables. You
will be considering questions like: Does a linear equation in two variables have a
solution? If yes, is it unique? What does the solution look like on the Cartesian plane?
You shall also use the concepts you studied in Chapter 3 to answer these questions.
4.2 Linear Equations
Let us first recall what you have studied so far. Consider the following equation:
2x + 5 = 0
Its solution, i.e., the root of the equation, is
 . This can be represented on the
number line as shown below:
Fig. 4.1
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
While solving an equation, you must always keep the following points in mind:
The solution of a linear equation is not affected when:
the same number is added to (or subtracted from) both the sides of the equation.
(ii) you multiply or divide both the sides of the equation by the same non-zero
number.
Let us now consider the following situation:
In a One-day International Cricket match between India and Sri Lanka played in
Nagpur, two Indian batsmen together scored 176 runs. Express this information in the
form of an equation.
Here, you can see that the score of neither of them is known, i.e., there are two
unknown quantities. Let us use x and y to denote them. So, the number of runs scored
by one of the batsmen is x, and the number of runs scored by the other is y. We know
x + y = 176,
which is the required equation.
This is an example of a linear equation in two variables. It is customary to denote
the variables in such equations by x and y, but other letters may also be used. Some
examples of linear equations in two variables are:
1.2s + 3t = 5, p + 4q = 7, ✁u + 5v = 9 and 3 =
2 x – 7y.
Note that you can put these equations in the form 1.2s + 3t – 5 = 0,
p + 4q – 7 = 0,
✁u + 5v – 9 = 0 and
2 x – 7y – 3 = 0, respectively.
So, any equation which can be put in the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c
are real numbers, and a and b are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two
variables. This means that you can think of many many such equations.
Example 1 : Write each of the following equations in the form ax + by + c = 0 and
indicate the values of a, b and c in each case:
(i) 2x + 3y = 4.37
(ii) x – 4 =
(iii) 4 = 5x – 3y
(iv) 2x = y
Solution : (i) 2x + 3y = 4.37 can be written as 2x + 3y – 4.37 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 3
and c = – 4.37.
The equation x – 4 =
3 y can be written as x –
3 y – 4 = 0. Here a = 1,
b = –
3  and c = – 4.
(iii) The equation 4 = 5x – 3y can be written as 5x – 3y – 4 = 0. Here a = 5, b = –3
and c = – 4. Do you agree that it can also be written as –5x + 3y + 4 = 0 ? In this
case a = –5, b = 3 and c = 4.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
(iv) The equation 2x = y can be written as 2x – y + 0 = 0. Here a = 2, b = –1 and
c = 0.
Equations of the type ax + b = 0 are also examples of linear equations in two variables
because they can be expressed as
ax + 0.y + b = 0
For example, 4 – 3x = 0 can be written as –3x + 0.y + 4 = 0.
Example 2 : Write each of the following as an equation in two variables:
(i) x = –5
(ii) y = 2
(iii) 2x = 3
(iv) 5y = 2
Solution : (i) x = –5 can be written as 1.x + 0.y = –5, or 1.x + 0.y + 5 = 0.
(ii) y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 1.y = 2, or 0.x + 1.y – 2 = 0.
(iii) 2x = 3 can be written as 2x + 0.y – 3 = 0.
(iv) 5y = 2 can be written as 0.x + 5y – 2 = 0.
EXERCISE 4.1

values of a, b and c in each case:
2x + 3y = 9.35
(ii) x – 5

(iii) –2x + 3y = 6
(iv) x = 3y
(v) 2x = –5y
(vi) 3x + 2 = 0
(vii) y – 2 = 0
(viii) 5 = 2x
4.3 Solution of a Linear Equation
You have seen that every linear equation in one variable has a unique solution. What
can you say about the solution of a linear equation involving two variables? As there
are two variables in the equation, a solution means a pair of values, one for x and one
for y which satisfy the given equation. Let us consider the equation 2x + 3y = 12.
Here, x = 3 and y = 2 is a solution because when you substitute x = 3 and y = 2 in the
equation above, you find that
2x + 3y = (2 × 3) + (3 × 2) = 12
This solution is written as an ordered pair (3, 2), first writing the value for x and
then the value for y. Similarly, (0, 4) is also a solution for the equation above.

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
On the other hand, (1, 4) is not a solution of 2x + 3y = 12, because on putting
x = 1 and y = 4 we get 2x + 3y = 14, which is not 12. Note that (0, 4) is a solution but
not (4, 0).
You have seen at least two solutions for 2x + 3y = 12, i.e., (3, 2) and (0, 4). Can
you find any other solution? Do you agree that (6, 0) is another solution? Verify the
same. In fact, we can get many many solutions in the following way. Pick a value of
your choice for x (say x = 2) in 2x + 3y = 12. Then the equation reduces to 4 + 3y = 12,
which is a linear equation in one variable. On solving this, you get y = 8
3. So
another solution of 2x + 3y = 12. Similarly, choosing x = – 5, you find that the equation
becomes –10 + 3y = 12. This gives y = 22
3 . So,
is another solution of
2x + 3y = 12. So there is no end to different solutions of a linear equation in two
variables. That is, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions.
Example 3 : Find four different solutions of the equation x + 2y = 6.
Solution : By inspection, x = 2, y = 2 is a solution because for x = 2, y = 2
x + 2y = 2 + 4 = 6
Now, let us choose x = 0. With this value of x, the given equation reduces to 2y = 6
which has the unique solution y = 3. So x = 0, y = 3 is also a solution of x + 2y = 6.
Similarly, taking y = 0, the given equation reduces to x = 6. So, x = 6, y = 0 is a solution
of x + 2y = 6 as well. Finally, let us take y = 1. The given equation now reduces to
x + 2 = 6, whose solution is given by x = 4. Therefore, (4, 1) is also a solution of the
given equation. So four of the infinitely many solutions of the given equation are:
(2, 2), (0, 3), (6, 0) and (4, 1).
Remark : Note that an easy way of getting a solution is to take x = 0 and get the
corresponding value of y. Similarly, we can put y = 0 and obtain the corresponding
value of x.
Example 4 : Find two solutions for each of the following equations:
4x + 3y = 12
(ii) 2x + 5y = 0
(iii) 3y + 4 = 0
Solution : (i) Taking x = 0, we get 3y = 12, i.e., y = 4. So, (0, 4) is a solution of the
given equation. Similarly, by taking y = 0, we get x = 3. Thus, (3, 0) is also a solution.
(ii) Taking x = 0, we get 5y = 0, i.e., y = 0. So (0, 0) is a solution of the given equation.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
Now, if you take y = 0, you again get (0, 0) as a solution, which is the same as the
earlier one. To get another solution, take x = 1, say. Then you can check that the
corresponding value of y is
is another solution of 2x + 5y = 0.
(iii) Writing the equation 3y + 4 = 0 as 0.x + 3y + 4 = 0, you will find that y =
– 3  for
any value of x. Thus, two solutions can be given as
and 1, –

4.4 Graph of a Linear Equation in Two Variables
So far, you have obtained the solutions of a linear equation in two variables algebraically.
Now, let us look at their geometric representation. You know that each such equation
has infinitely many solutions. How can we show them in the coordinate plane? You
may have got some indication in which we write the solution as pairs of values. The
solutions of the linear equation in Example 3, namely,
x + 2y = 6
can be expressed in the form of a table as follows by writing the values of y below the
corresponding values of x :

In the previous chapter, you
studied how to plot the points on a
graph paper. Let us plot the points
(0, 3), (2, 2), (4, 1) and (6, 0) on a
graph paper. Now join any of these
two points and obtain a line. Let us
call this as line AB (see Fig. 4.2).
Do you see that the other two
points also lie on the line AB? Now,
pick another point on this line, say
(8, –1). Is this a solution? In fact,
8 + 2(–1) = 6. So, (8, –1) is a solution.
Pick any other point on this line AB
and verify whether its coordinates
satisfy the equation or not. Now, take
any point not lying on the line AB, say (2, 0). Do its coordinates satisfy the equation?
Check, and see that they do not.
Let us list our observations:
1. Every point whose coordinates satisfy Equation (1) lies on the line AB.
2. Every point (a, b) on the line AB gives a solution x = a, y = b of Equation (1).
3. Any point, which does not lie on the line AB, is not a solution of Equation (1).
So, you can conclude that every point on the line satisfies the equation of the line
and every solution of the equation is a point on the line. In fact, a linear equation in two
variables is represented geometrically by a line whose points make up the collection of
solutions of the equation. This is called the graph of the linear equation. So, to obtain
the graph of a linear equation in two variables, it is enough to plot two points
corresponding to two solutions and join them by a line. However, it is advisable to plot
more than two such points so that you can immediately check the correctness of the
graph.
Remark : The reason that a degree one polynomial equation ax + by + c = 0 is called
a linear equation is that its geometrical representation is a straight line.
Example 5 : Given the point (1, 2), find the equation of a line on which it lies. How
many such equations are there?
Solution : Here (1, 2) is a solution of a linear equation you are looking for. So, you are
looking for any line passing through the point (1, 2). One example of such a linear
equation is x + y = 3. Others are y – x = 1, y = 2x, since they are also satisfied by the
coordinates of the point (1, 2). In fact, there are infinitely many linear equations which
Fig. 4.2
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
are satisfied by the coordinates of the point (1, 2). Can you see this pictorially?
Example 6 : Draw the graph of x + y = 7.
Solution : To draw the graph, we
need at least two solutions of the
equation. You can check that x = 0,
y = 7, and x = 7, y = 0 are solutions
of the given equation. So, you can
use the following table to draw the
graph:
Table 2
Draw the graph by plotting the
two points from Table 2 and then
by joining the same by a line (see Fig. 4.3).
Example 7 : You know that the force applied on
a body is directly proportional to the acceleration
produced in the body. Write an equation to express
this situation and plot the graph of the equation.
Solution : Here the variables involved are force
and acceleration. Let the force applied be y units
and the acceleration produced be x units. From
ratio and proportion, you can express this fact as
y = kx, where k is a constant. (From your study
of science, you know that k is actually the mass
of the body.)
Now, since we do not know what k is, we cannot
draw the precise graph of y = kx. However, if we
give a certain value to k, then we can draw the
graph. Let us take k = 3, i.e., we draw the line
representing y = 3x.
For this we find two of its solutions, say (0, 0) and
(2, 6) (see Fig. 4.4).
Fig. 4.3
Fig. 4.4

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
From the graph, you can see that when the force applied is 3 units, the acceleration
produced is 1 unit. Also, note that (0, 0) lies on the graph which means the acceleration
produced is 0 units, when the force applied is 0 units.
Remark : The graph of the equation of the form y = kx is a line which always passes
through the origin.
Example 8 : For each of the graphs given in Fig. 4.5 select the equation whose graph
it is from the choices given below:
(a) For Fig. 4.5 (i),
x + y = 0
(ii) y = 2x

(ii) y = 2x
(iii) y = 2x + 1
(iv) y = 2x – 4

Solution : (a) In Fig. 4.5 (i), the points on the line are (–1, –2), (0, 0), (1, 2). By
inspection, y = 2x is the equation corresponding to this graph. You can find that the
y-coordinate in each case is double that of the x-coordinate.
(b) In Fig. 4.5 (ii), the points on the line are (–2, 0), (0, 4), (1, 6). You know that the
coordinates of the points of the graph (line) satisfy the equation y = 2x + 4. So,
y = 2x + 4 is the equation corresponding to the graph in Fig. 4.5 (ii).
(c) In Fig. 4.5 (iii), the points on the line are (–1, –6), (0, –4), (1, –2), (2, 0). By inspection,
you can see that y = 2x – 4 is the equation corresponding to the given graph (line).

4.5 Equations of Lines Parallel to the x-axis and y-axis
You have studied how to write the coordinates of a given point in the Cartesian plane.
Do you know where the points (2, 0), (–3, 0), (4, 0) and (n, 0), for any real number
n, lie in the Cartesian plane? Yes, they all lie on the x-axis. But do you know why?
Because on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of each point is 0. In fact, every point on the
x-axis is of the form (x, 0). Can you now guess the equation of the x-axis? It is given
by y = 0. Note that y = 0 can be expressed as 0.x + 1.y = 0. Similarly, observe that the
equation of the y-axis is given by x = 0.
Now, consider the equation x – 2 = 0. If this is treated as an equation in one
variable x only, then it has the unique solution x = 2, which is a point on the number line.
However, when treated as an equation in two variables, it can be expressed as
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-4\Chap-4 (02-01-2006) PM65
x + 0.y – 2 = 0. This has infinitely many
solutions. In fact, they are all of the form
(2, r), where r is any real number. Also, you
can check that every point of the form (2, r)
is a solution of this equation. So as, an
equation in two variables, x – 2 = 0 is
represented by the line AB in the graph in
Fig. 4.8.
Example 9 : Solve the equation
2x + 1 = x – 3, and represent the solution(s)
(i) the number line,
(ii) the Cartesian plane.
Solution : We solve 2x + 1 = x – 3, to get
2x – x = –3 – 1
i.e.,
x = –4
(i) The representation of the solution on the number line is shown in Fig. 4.9, where
x = – 4 is treated as an equation in one variable.
Fig. 4.9
(ii) We know that x = – 4 can be written as
x + 0.y = – 4
which is a linear equation in the variables
x and y. This is represented by a line. Now
all the values of y are permissible because
0.y is always 0. However, x must satisfy the
equation x = – 4. Hence, two solutions of the
given equation are x = – 4, y =  0 and x = – 4,
y = 2.
Note that the graph AB is a line parallel to
the y-axis and at a distance of 4 units to the
left of it (see Fig. 4.10).

CHAPTER 5
INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY
5.1 Introduction
The word ‘geometry’ comes form the Greek words ‘geo’, meaning the ‘earth’,
and ‘metrein’, meaning ‘to measure’. Geometry appears to have originated from
the need for measuring land. This branch of mathematics was studied in various
forms in every ancient civilisation, be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece,
the Incas, etc. The people of these civilisations faced several practical problems
which required the development of geometry in various ways.
For example, whenever the river Nile
overflowed, it wiped out the boundaries between
the adjoining fields of different land owners. After
such flooding, these boundaries had to be
redrawn. For this purpose, the Egyptians
developed a number of geometric techniques and
rules for calculating simple areas and also for
doing simple constructions. The knowledge of
geometry was also used by them for computing
volumes of granaries, and for constructing canals
and pyramids. They also knew the correct formula
to find the volume of a truncated pyramid (see
Fig. 5.1).You know that a pyramid is a solid figure,
the base of which is a triangle, or square, or some
other polygon, and its side faces are triangles
converging to a point at the top.

In the Indian subcontinent, the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, etc.
show that the Indus Valley Civilisation (about 3000 BC) made extensive use of geometry.
It was a highly organised society. The cities were highly developed and very well
planned. For example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was an
underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different types. This
shows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and practical arithmetic.
The bricks used for constructions were kiln fired and the ratio length : breadth : thickness,
of the bricks was found to be 4 : 2 : 1.
In ancient India, the Sulbasutras (800 BC to 500 BC) were the manuals of
geometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the
construction of altars (or vedis) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. The location
of the sacred fires had to be in accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about
their shapes and areas, if they were to be effective instruments. Square and circular
altars were used for household rituals, while altars whose shapes were combinations
of rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were required for public worship. The sriyantra
(given in the Atharvaveda) consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. These
triangles are arranged in such a way that they produce 43 subsidiary triangles. Though
accurate geometric methods were used for the constructions of altars, the principles
behind them were not discussed.
These examples show that geometry was being developed and applied everywhere
in the world. But this was happening in an unsystematic manner. What is interesting
about these developments of geometry in the ancient world is that they were passed
on from one generation to the next, either orally or through palm leaf messages, or by
other ways. Also, we find that in some civilisations like Babylonia, geometry remained
a very practical oriented discipline, as was the case in India and Rome. The geometry
developed by Egyptians mainly consisted of the statements of results. There were no
general rules of the procedure. In fact, Babylonians and Egyptians used geometry
mostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic science.
But in civilisations like Greece, the emphasis was on the reasoning behind why certain
constructions work. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the
statements they discovered using deductive reasoning (see Appendix 1).
A Greek mathematician, Thales is credited with giving the
first known proof. This proof was of the statement that a circle
is bisected (i.e., cut into two equal parts) by its diameter. One of
Thales’ most famous pupils was Pythagoras (572 BC), whom
you have heard about. Pythagoras and his group discovered many
geometric properties and developed the theory of geometry to a
great extent. This process continued till 300 BC. At that time
Euclid, a teacher of mathematics at Alexandria in Egypt, collected
all the known work and arranged it in his famous treatise,
Thales
(640 BC – 546 BC)
Fig. 5.2
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-5\Chap-5 (02–01–2006) PM65
called ‘Elements’. He divided the ‘Elements’ into thirteen
chapters, each called a book. These books influenced
the whole world’s understanding of geometry for
generations to come.
In this chapter, we shall discuss Euclid’s approach
to geometry and shall try to link it with the present day
geometry.
5.2 Euclid’s Definitions, Axioms and Postulates
The Greek mathematicians of Euclid’s time thought of geometry as an abstract model
of the world in which they lived. The notions of point, line, plane (or surface) and so on
were derived from what was seen around them. From studies of the space and solids
in the space around them, an abstract geometrical notion of a solid object was developed.
A solid has shape, size, position, and can be moved from one place to another. Its
boundaries are called surfaces. They separate one part of the space from another,
and are said to have no thickness. The boundaries of the surfaces are curves or
straight lines. These lines end in points.
Consider the three steps from solids to points (solids-surfaces-lines-points). In
each step we lose one extension, also called a dimension. So, a solid has three
dimensions, a surface has two, a line has one and a point has none. Euclid summarised
these statements as definitions. He began his exposition by listing 23 definitions in
Book 1 of the ‘Elements’. A few of them are given below :
A point  is that which has no part.
A line is breadthless length.
The ends of a line are points.
A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.
A surface is that which has length and breadth only.
The edges of a surface are lines.
A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.
If you carefully study these definitions, you find that some of the terms like part,
breadth, length, evenly, etc. need to be further explained clearly. For example, consider
his definition of a point. In this definition, ‘a part’ needs to be defined. Suppose if you
define ‘a part’ to be that which occupies ‘area’, again ‘an area’ needs to be defined.
So, to define one thing, you need to define many other things, and you may get a long
chain of definitions without an end. For such reasons, mathematicians agree to leave
Euclid (325 BC – 265 BC)
Fig. 5.3
INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY

some geometric terms undefined. However, we do have a intuitive feeling for the
geometric concept of a point than what the ‘definition’ above gives us. So, we represent
a point as a dot, even though a dot has some dimension.
A similar problem arises in Definition 2 above, since it refers to breadth and length,
neither of which has been defined. Because of this, a few terms are kept undefined
while developing any course of study. So, in geometry, we take a point, a line and a
plane (in Euclid‘s words a plane surface) as undefined terms. The only thing is
that we can represent them intuitively, or explain them with the help of ‘physical
models’.
Starting with his definitions, Euclid assumed certain properties, which were not to
be proved. These assumptions are actually ‘obvious universal truths’. He divided them
into two types: axioms and postulates. He used the term ‘postulate’ for the assumptions
that were specific to geometry. Common notions (often called axioms), on the other
hand, were assumptions used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to
geometry. For details about axioms and postulates, refer to Appendix 1. Some of
Euclid’s axioms, not in his order, are given below :
(1) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.
(2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
(3) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
(4) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
(5) The whole is greater than the part.
(6) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another.
(7) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.
These ‘common notions’ refer to magnitudes of some kind. The first common
notion could be applied to plane figures. For example, if an area of a triangle equals the
area of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle equals that of a square, then the area
of the triangle also equals the area of the square.
Magnitudes of the same kind can be compared and added, but magnitudes of
different kinds cannot be compared. For example, a line cannot be added to a rectangle,
nor can an angle be compared to a pentagon.
The 4th axiom given above seems to say that if two things are identical (that is,
they are the same), then they are equal. In other words, everything equals itself. It is
the justification of the principle of superposition. Axiom (5) gives us the definition of
‘greater than’. For example, if a quantity B is a part of another quantity A, then A can
be written as the sum of B and some third quantity C. Symbolically, A > B means that
there is some C such that A = B + C.

Now let us discuss Euclid’s five postulates. They are :
Postulate 1 : A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.
Note that this postulate tells us that at least one straight line passes through two
distinct points, but it does not say that there cannot be more than one such line. However,
in his work, Euclid has frequently assumed, without mentioning, that there is a unique
line joining two distinct points. We state this result in the form of an axiom as follows:
Axiom 5.1 : Given two distinct points, there is a unique line that passes through
them.
How many lines passing through P also pass through Q (see Fig. 5.4)? Only one,
that is, the line PQ. How many lines passing through Q also pass through P? Only one,
that is, the line PQ. Thus, the statement above is self-evident, and so is taken as an
axiom.
Fig. 5.4
Postulate 2 : A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.
Note that what we call a line segment now-a-days is what Euclid called a terminated
line. So, according to the present day terms, the second postulate says that a line
segment can be extended on either side to form a line (see Fig. 5.5).
Fig. 5.5
Postulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.
Postulate 4 : All right angles are equal to one another.
Postulate 5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior
angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the
two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of
angles is less than two right angles.

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-5\Chap-5 (02–01–2006) PM65
For example, the line PQ in Fig. 5.6 falls on lines
AB and CD such that the sum of the interior angles 1
and 2 is less than 180° on the left side of PQ.
Therefore, the lines AB and CD will eventually
intersect on the left side of PQ.
A brief look at the five postulates brings to your notice that Postulate 5 is far more
complex than any other postulate. On the other hand, Postulates 1 through 4 are so
simple and obvious that these are taken as ‘self-evident truths’. However, it is not
possible to prove them. So, these statements are accepted without any proof
(see Appendix 1). Because of its complexity, the fifth postulate will be given more
attention in the next section.
Now-a-days, ‘postulates’ and ‘axioms’ are terms that are used interchangeably
and in the same sense. ‘Postulate’ is actually a verb. When we say “let us postulate”,
we mean, “let us make some statement based on the observed phenomenon in the
Universe”. Its truth/validity is checked afterwards. If it is true, then it is accepted as a
‘Postulate’.
A system of axioms is called consistent (see Appendix 1), if it is impossible to
deduce from these axioms a statement that contradicts any axiom or previously proved
statement. So, when any system of axioms is given, it needs to be ensured that the
system is consistent.
After Euclid stated his postulates and axioms, he used them to prove other results.
Then using these results, he proved some more results by applying deductive reasoning.
The statements that were proved are called propositions or theorems. Euclid
deduced 465 propositions in a logical chain using his axioms, postulates, definitions and
theorems proved earlier in the chain. In the next few chapters on geometry, you will
be using these axioms to prove some theorems.
Now, let us see in the following examples how Euclid used his axioms and postulates
for proving some of the results:
Example 1 : If A, B and C are three points on a line, and B lies between A and C
(see Fig. 5.7), then prove that AB + BC = AC.
Fig. 5.7
Fig. 5.6
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-5\Chap-5 (02–01–2006) PM65
Solution : In the figure given above, AC coincides with AB + BC.
Also, Euclid’s Axiom (4) says that things which coincide with one another are equal to
one another. So, it can be deduced that
AB + BC = AC
Note that in this solution, it has been assumed that there is a unique line passing
through two points.
Example 2 : Prove that an equilateral triangle can be constructed on any given line
segment.
Solution : In the statement above, a line segment of any length is given, say AB
[see Fig. 5.8(i)].
Fig. 5.8
Here, you need to do some construction. Using Euclid’s Postulate 3, you can draw a
circle with point A as the centre and AB as the radius [see Fig. 5.8(ii)]. Similarly, draw
another circle with point B as the centre and BA as the radius. The two circles meet at
a point, say C. Now, draw the line segments AC and BC to form
[see Fig. 5.8 (iii)].
So, you have to prove that this triangle is equilateral, i.e., AB = AC = BC.
AB = AC, since they are the radii of the same circle
Similarly, AB = BC
(Radii of the same circle)
From these two facts, and Euclid’s axiom that things which are equal to the same thing
are equal to one another, you can conclude that AB = BC = AC.
✁ABC is an equilateral triangle.
Note that here Euclid has assumed, without mentioning anywhere, that the two circles
drawn with centres A and B will meet each other at a point.
Now we prove a theorem, which is frequently used in different results:
INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-5\Chap-5 (02–01–2006) PM65
Theorem 5.1 : Two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.
Proof : Here we are given two lines l and m. We need to prove that they have only one
point in common.
For the time being, let us suppose that the two lines intersect in two distinct points,
say P and Q. So, you have two lines passing through two distinct points P and Q. But
this assumption clashes with the axiom that only one line can pass through two distinct
points. So, the assumption that we started with, that two lines can pass through two
distinct points is wrong.
From this, what can we conclude? We are forced to conclude that two distinct
lines cannot have more than one point in common.
 EXERCISE 5.1
Which of the following statements are true and which are false? Give reasons for your
answers.
Only one line can pass through a single point.
(ii) There are an infinite number of lines which pass through two distinct points.
(iii) A terminated line can be produced indefinitely on both the sides.
(iv) If two circles are equal, then their radii are equal.
(v) In Fig. 5.9, if AB = PQ and PQ = XY, then AB = XY.

Consider two ‘postulates’ given below:
Given any two distinct points A and B, there exists a third point C which is in
between A and B.
(ii) There exist at least three points that are not on the same line.
Do these postulates contain any undefined terms? Are these postulates consistent?
Do they follow from Euclid’s postulates? Explain.

Fig. 5.10
Why is Axiom 5, in the list of Euclid’s axioms, considered a ‘universal truth’? (Note that
the question is not about the fifth postulate.)
5.3 Equivalent Versions of Euclid’s Fifth Postulate
Euclid’s fifth postulate is very significant in the history of mathematics. Recall it again
from Section 5.2. We see that by implication, no intersection of lines will take place
when the sum of the measures of the interior angles on the same side of the falling line
is exactly 180°. There are several equivalent versions of this postulate. One of them is
‘Playfair’s Axiom’ (given by a Scottish mathematician John Playfair in 1729), as stated
below:
‘For every line l and for every point P not lying on l, there exists a unique line
m passing through P and parallel to l’.
From Fig. 5.11, you can see that of all the lines passing through the point P, only line
m is parallel to line l.
Fig. 5.11
This result can also be stated in the following form:
Two distinct intersecting lines cannot be parallel to the same line.
INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-5\Chap-5 (02–01–2006) PM65
Euclid did not require his fifth postulate to prove his first
28 theorems. Many mathematicians, including him, were
convinced that the fifth postulate is actually a theorem that
can be proved using just the first four postulates and other
axioms. However, all attempts to prove the fifth postulate as a
theorem have failed. But these efforts have led to a great
achievement – the creation of several other geometries. These
geometries are quite different from Euclidean geometry. They
are called non-Euclidean geometries. Their creation is
considered a landmark in the history of thought because till
then everyone had believed that Euclid’s was the only geometry
and the world itself was Euclidean. Now the geometry of the universe we live in has been
shown to be a non-Euclidean geometry. In fact, it is called spherical geometry. In spherical
geometry, lines are not straight. They are parts of great circles (i.e., circles obtained by
the intersection of a sphere and planes passing through the centre of the sphere).
In Fig. 5.12, the lines AN and BN (which are parts of great circles of a sphere) are
perpendicular to the same line AB. But they are meeting each other, though the sum of
the angles on the same side of line AB is not less than two right angles (in fact, it is 90°
+ 90° = 180°). Also, note that the sum of the angles of the triangle NAB is greater than
180°, as
✂ A +
✂ B = 180°. Thus, Euclidean geometry is valid only for the figures in the
plane. On the curved surfaces, it fails.
Now, let us consider an example.
Example 3 : Consider the following statement : There exists a pair of straight lines
that are everywhere equidistant from one another. Is this statement a direct consequence
of Euclid’s fifth postulate? Explain.
Solution : Take any line l and a point P not on l. Then, by Playfair’s axiom, which is
equivalent to the fifth postulate, we know that there is a unique line m through P which
is parallel to l.
Now, the distance of a point from a line is the length of the perpendicular from
the point to the line. This distance will be the same for any point on m from l and any
point on l from m. So, these two lines are everywhere equidistant from one another.
Remark : The geometry that you will be studying in the next few chapters is
Euclidean Geometry. However, the axioms and theorems used by us may be different
from those of Euclid’s.

5.4 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
Though Euclid defined a point, a line, and a plane, the definitions are not accepted by
mathematicians. Therefore, these terms are now taken as undefined.
Axioms or postulates are the assumptions which are obvious universal truths. They are not
proved.
Theorems are statements which are proved, using definitions, axioms, previously proved
statements and deductive reasining.
Some of Euclid’s axioms were :
(1) Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.
(2) If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
(3) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
(4) Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
(5) The whole is greater than the part.
(6) Things which are double of the same things are equal to one another.
(7) Things which are halves of the same things are equal to one another.
Euclid’s postulates were :
Postulate 1 : A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.
Postulate 2 : A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.
Postulate 3 : A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.
Postulate  4 : All right angles are equal to one another.
Postulate  5 : If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the
same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if
produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of angles is less than two right
angles.
Two equivalent versions of Euclid’s fifth postulate are:
‘For every line l and for every point P not lying on l, there exists a unique line m
passing through P and parallel to l’.
(ii) Two distinct intersecting lines cannot be parallel to the same line.
All the attempts to prove Euclid’s fifth postulate using the first 4 postulates failed. But they
led to the discovery of several other geometries, called non-Euclidean geometries.
CHAPTER 6
LINES AND ANGLES
6.1 Introduction
In Chapter 5, you have studied that a minimum of two points are required to draw a
line. You have also studied some axioms and, with the help of these axioms, you
proved some other statements. In this chapter, you will study the properties of the
angles formed when two lines intersect each other, and also the properties of the
angles formed when a line intersects two or more parallel lines at distinct points.
Further you will use these properties to prove some statements using deductive reasoning
(see Appendix 1). You have already verified these statements through some activities
in the earlier classes.
In your daily life, you see different types of angles formed between the edges of
plane surfaces. For making a similar kind of model using the plane surfaces, you need
to have a thorough knowledge of angles. For instance, suppose you want to make a
model of a hut to keep in the school exhibition using bamboo sticks. Imagine how you
would make it? You would keep some of the sticks parallel to each other, and some
sticks would be kept slanted. Whenever an architect has to draw a plan for a multistoried
building, she has to draw intersecting lines and parallel lines at different angles. Without
the knowledge of the properties of these lines and angles, do you think she can draw
the layout of the building?
In science, you study the properties of light by drawing the ray diagrams.
For example, to study the refraction property of light when it enters from one medium
to the other medium, you use the properties of intersecting lines and parallel lines.
When two or more forces act on a body, you draw the diagram in which forces are
represented by directed line segments to study the net effect of the forces on the
body. At that time, you need to know the relation between the angles when the rays
(or line segments) are parallel to or intersect each other. To find the height of a tower
or to find the distance of a ship from the light house, one needs to know the angle

formed between the horizontal and the line of sight. Plenty of other examples can be
given where lines and angles are used. In the subsequent chapters of geometry, you
will be using these properties of lines and angles to deduce more and more useful
properties.
Let us first revise the terms and definitions related to lines and angles learnt in
earlier classes.
6.2 Basic Terms and Definitions
Recall that a part (or portion) of a line with two end points is called a line-segment
and a part of a line with one end point is called a ray. Note that the line segment AB is
denoted by AB , and its length is denoted by AB. The ray AB is denoted by AB, and
a line is denoted by AB. However, we will not use these symbols, and will denote
the line segment AB, ray AB, length AB and line AB by the same symbol, AB. The
meaning will be clear from the context. Sometimes small letters l, m, n, etc. will be
used to denote lines.
If three or more points lie on the same line, they are called collinear points;
otherwise they are called non-collinear points.
Recall that an angle is formed when two rays originate from the same end point.
The rays making an angle are called the arms of the angle and the end point is called
the vertex of the angle. You have studied different types of angles, such as acute
angle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle and reflex angle in earlier classes
(see Fig. 6.1).
(i) acute angle : 0° < x < 90°
(ii) right angle : y = 90°
(iii) obtuse angle : 90° < z < 180°
(iv) straight angle : s = 180°
(v) reflex angle : 180° < t < 360°
Fig. 6.1 : Types of Angles
LINES AND ANGLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
An acute angle measures between 0° and 90°, whereas a right angle is exactly
equal to 90°. An angle greater than 90° but less than 180° is called an obtuse angle.
Also, recall that a straight angle is equal to 180°. An angle which is greater than 180°
but less than 360° is called a reflex angle. Further, two angles whose sum is 90° are
called complementary angles, and two angles whose sum is 180° are called
supplementary angles.
You have also studied about adjacent angles
in the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.2). Two angles
are adjacent, if they have a common vertex, a
common arm and their non-common arms are
on different sides of the common arm. In
Fig. 6.2,
✁ABD and
✁DBC are adjacent
angles. Ray BD is their common arm and point
B is their common vertex. Ray BA and ray BC
are non common arms. Moreover, when two
angles are adjacent, then their sum is always
equal to the angle formed by the two non-
common arms. So, we can write
✁ABC =
✁ABD +
✁DBC.
Note that
✁ABC and
✁ABD are not
adjacent angles. Why? Because their non-
common arms BD and BC lie on the same side
of the common arm BA.
If the non-common arms BA and BC in
Fig. 6.2, form a line then it will look like Fig. 6.3.
In this case,
✁ABD and
✁DBC are called
linear pair of angles.
You may also recall the vertically opposite
angles formed when two lines, say AB and CD,
intersect each other, say at the point O
(see Fig. 6.4). There are two pairs of vertically
opposite angles.
One pair is
✁AOD and
✁BOC. Can you
find the other pair?

6.3 Intersecting Lines and Non-intersecting Lines
Draw two different lines PQ and RS on a paper. You will see that you can draw them
in two different ways as shown in Fig. 6.5 (i) and Fig. 6.5 (ii).
(i) Intersecting lines
(ii) Non-intersecting (parallel) lines
Fig. 6.5 : Different ways of drawing two lines
Recall the notion of a line, that it extends indefinitely in both directions. Lines PQ
and RS in Fig. 6.5 (i) are intersecting lines and in Fig. 6.5 (ii) are parallel lines. Note
that the lengths of the common perpendiculars at different points on these parallel
lines is the same. This equal length is called the distance between two parallel lines.
6.4 Pairs of Angles
In Section 6.2, you have learnt the definitions of
some of the pairs of angles such as
complementary angles, supplementary angles,
adjacent angles, linear pair of angles, etc. Can
you think of some relations between these
angles? Now, let us find out the relation between
the angles formed when a ray stands on a line.
Draw a figure in which a ray stands on a line as
shown in Fig. 6.6. Name the line as AB and the
ray as OC. What are the angles formed at the
point O? They are
✁AOC,
✁BOC and
✁AOB.
Can we write
✁AOC +
✁BOC =
✁AOB?
Yes! (Why? Refer to adjacent angles in Section 6.2)
What is the measure of
✁AOB? It is 180°.
(Why?)
From (1) and (2), can you say that
✁AOC +
✁BOC = 180°?
Yes! (Why?)
From the above discussion, we can state the following Axiom:
Fig. 6.6 : Linear pair of angles
LINES AND ANGLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
Axiom 6.1 : If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of two adjacent angles so
formed is 180°.
Recall that when the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then they are called a
linear pair of angles.
In Axiom 6.1, it is given that ‘a ray stands on a line’. From this ‘given’, we have
concluded that ‘the sum of two adjacent angles so formed is 180°’. Can we write
Axiom 6.1 the other way? That is, take the ‘conclusion’ of Axiom 6.1 as ‘given’ and
the ‘given’ as the ‘conclusion’. So it becomes:
(A) If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then a ray stands on a line (that is,
the non-common arms form a line).
Now you see that the Axiom 6.1 and statement (A) are in a sense the reverse of
each others. We call each as converse of the other. We do not know whether the
statement (A) is true or not. Let us check. Draw adjacent angles of different measures
as shown in Fig. 6.7. Keep the ruler along one of the non-common arms in each case.
Does the other non-common arm also lie along the ruler?
Fig. 6.7 : Adjacent angles with different measures
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
You will find that only in Fig. 6.7 (iii), both the non-common arms lie along the
ruler, that is, points A, O and B lie on the same line and ray OC stands on it. Also see
✁AOC +
✁COB = 125° + 55° = 180°. From this, you may conclude that statement
(A) is true. So, you can state in the form of an axiom as follows:
Axiom 6.2 : If the sum of two adjacent angles is 180°, then the non-common arms
of the angles form a line.
For obvious reasons, the two axioms above together is called the Linear Pair
Axiom.
Let us now examine the case when two lines intersect each other.
Recall, from earlier classes,  that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite
angles are equal. Let us prove this result now. See Appendix 1 for the ingredients of a
proof, and keep those in mind while studying the proof given below.
Theorem 6.1 : If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite
angles are equal.
Proof : In the statement above, it is given
that ‘two lines intersect each other’. So, let
AB and CD be two lines intersecting at O as
shown in Fig. 6.8. They lead to two pairs of
vertically opposite angles, namely,
✁AOC and
✁BOD (ii)
✁AOD and
✁BOC.
We need to prove that
✁AOC =
✁AOD =
✁BOC.
Now, ray OA stands on line CD.
Therefore,
✁AOC +
✁AOD = 180°
(Linear pair axiom) (1)
Can we write
✁AOD +
✁BOD = 180°? Yes! (Why?)
From (1) and (2), we can write
✁AOC +
✁AOD =
✁AOD +
This implies that
✁AOC =
(Refer Section 5.2, Axiom 3)
Similarly, it can be proved that
✁AOD =
 Now, let us do some examples based on Linear Pair Axiom and Theorem 6.1.

intersect each other at point O. If
✁POR :
✁ROQ = 5 : 7, find all the angles.
Solution :
✁POR +
✁ROQ = 180°
(Linear pair of angles)
✁POR :
✁ROQ = 5 : 7
(Given)
Therefore,
✁POR =
12  × 180° = 75°
Similarly,
✁ROQ =
12  × 180° = 105°
✁POS =
✁ROQ = 105°
(Vertically opposite angles)
✁SOQ =
✁POR = 75°
(Vertically opposite angles)
Example 2 : In Fig. 6.10, ray OS stands on a line POQ. Ray OR and ray OT are
angle bisectors of
✁POS and
✁SOQ, respectively. If
✁POS = x, find
✁ROT.
Solution : Ray OS stands on the line POQ.
Therefore,
✁POS +
✁SOQ = 180°
✁POS = x
Therefore,
✁SOQ = 180°
✁SOQ = 180° – x
Now, ray OR bisects
✁POS, therefore,
✁ROS = 1
2  × x = 2
Similarly,
✁SOT = 1

Example 3 : In Fig. 6.11, OP, OQ, OR and OS are
four rays. Prove that ✁POQ + ✁QOR + ✁SOR +
✁POS = 360°.
Solution : In Fig. 6.11, you need to produce any of
the rays OP, OQ, OR or OS backwards to a point.
Let us produce ray OQ backwards to a point T so
that TOQ is a line (see Fig. 6.12).
Now, ray OP stands on line TOQ.
Therefore,
✁TOP + ✁POQ = 180°
(Linear pair axiom)
Similarly, ray OS stands on line TOQ.
Therefore,
✁TOS + ✁SOQ = 180°
✁SOQ =
✁SOR +
So, (2) becomes
✁TOS +
✁SOR + ✁QOR = 180°
Now, adding (1) and (3), you get
✁TOP +
✁POQ +
✁TOS +
✁SOR +
✁QOR = 360°
✁TOP + ✁TOS =

6.5 Parallel Lines and a Transversal
Recall that a line which intersects two or more lines
at distinct points is called a transversal
(see Fig. 6.18). Line l intersects lines m and n at
points P and Q respectively. Therefore, line l is a
transversal for lines m and n. Observe that four angles
are formed at each of the points P and Q.
Let us name these angles as
✁2, . . .,
✁8 as
shown in Fig. 6.18.
✁7 and
✁8 are called exterior
angles, while
✁5 and
✁6 are called
interior angles.
Recall that in the earlier classes, you have named some pairs of angles formed
when a transversal intersects two lines. These are as follows:
(a) Corresponding angles :
(i) ✁1 and ✁5
✁2 and ✁6
(iii)
✁4 and
✁3 and ✁7
(b) Alternate interior angles :
(i) ✁4 and ✁6
✁3 and ✁5
(c) Alternate exterior angles:
(i) ✁1 and
✁2 and ✁8
(d) Interior angles on the same side of the transversal:
✁4 and
✁3 and ✁6
Interior angles on the same side of the transversal
are also referred to as consecutive interior angles
or allied angles or co-interior angles. Further, many
a times, we simply use the words alternate angles for
alternate interior angles.
Now, let us find out the relation between the
angles in these pairs when line m is parallel to line n.
You know that the ruled lines of your notebook are
parallel to each other. So, with ruler and pencil, draw
two parallel lines along any two of these lines and a
transversal to intersect them as shown in Fig. 6.19.
Fig. 6.18

Now, measure any pair of corresponding angles and find out the relation between
them. You may find that :
✁8 and
✁7. From this,
you may conclude the following axiom.
Axiom 6.3 : If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of
corresponding angles is equal.
Axiom 6.3 is also referred to as the corresponding angles axiom. Now, let us
discuss the converse of this axiom which is as follows:
If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of corresponding angles is
equal, then the two lines are parallel.
Does this statement hold true? It can be verified as follows: Draw a line AD and
mark points B and C on it. At B and C, construct
✁ABQ and
✁BCS equal to each
other as shown in Fig. 6.20 (i).
Fig. 6.20
Produce QB and SC on the other side of AD to form two lines PQ and RS
[see Fig. 6.20 (ii)]. You may observe that the two lines do not intersect each other. You
may also draw common perpendiculars to the two lines PQ and RS at different points
and measure their lengths. You will find it the same everywhere. So, you may conclude
that the lines are parallel. Therefore, the converse of corresponding angles axiom is
also true. So, we have the following axiom:
Axiom 6.4 : If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of corresponding
angles is equal, then the two lines are parallel to each other.
Can we use corresponding angles axiom to find
out the relation between the alternate interior angles
when a transversal intersects two parallel lines? In
Fig. 6.21, transveral PS intersects parallel lines AB
and CD at points Q and R respectively.
✁BQR =
✁QRC and
✁AQR =
✁QRD?
You know that
✁PQA =
(Corresponding angles axiom)
Fig. 6.21
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
✁PQA =
✁BQR? Yes! (Why ?)
So, from (1) and (2), you may conclude that
✁BQR =
✁QRC.
Similarly,
✁AQR =
✁QRD.
This result can be stated as a theorem given below:
Theorem 6.2 : If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of
alternate interior angles is equal.
Now, using the converse of the corresponding angles axiom, can we show the two
lines parallel if a pair of alternate interior angles is equal? In Fig. 6.22, the transversal
PS intersects lines AB and CD at points Q and R respectively such that
✁BQR =
✁QRC.
Is AB || CD?
✁BQR =
(Why?)
✁BQR =
(Given)
So, from (1) and (2), you may conclude that
✁PQA =
But they are corresponding angles.
So, AB || CD
(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)
This result can be stated as a theorem given below:
Theorem 6.3 : If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of alternate
interior angles is equal, then the two lines are parallel.
In a similar way, you can obtain the following two theorems related to interior angles
on the same side of the transversal.
Theorem 6.4 : If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of
interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary.
Theorem 6.5 : If a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of interior
angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary, then the two lines
are parallel.
You may recall that you have verified all the above axioms and theorems in earlier
classes through activities. You may repeat those activities here also.

6.6 Lines Parallel to the Same Line
If two lines are parallel to the same line, will they be parallel to each other? Let us
check it. See Fig. 6.23 in which line m || line l and line n || line l.
Let us draw a line t transversal for the lines, l, m and n. It is given that
line m || line l and line n || line l.
Therefore,
✁2 and
(Corresponding angles axiom)
✁3 (Why?)
✁2 and
✁3 are corresponding angles and they
are equal.
Therefore, you can say that
Line m || Line n
(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)
This result can be stated in the form of the following theorem:
Theorem 6.6 : Lines which are parallel to the same line are parallel to each
other.
Note : The property above can be extended to more than two lines also.
Now, let us solve some examples related to parallel lines.
Example 4 : In Fig. 6.24, if PQ || RS,
✁MXQ = 135° and
✁MYR = 40°, find
✁XMY.
Fig. 6.24
Fig. 6.25
Solution : Here, we need to draw a line AB parallel to line PQ, through point M as
shown in Fig. 6.25. Now, AB || PQ and PQ || RS.
Fig. 6.23
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
Therefore,
AB || RS
(Why?)
✁QXM + ✁ XMB = 180°
(AB || PQ, Interior angles on the same side of the transversal XM)
✁QXM = 135°
135° +
✁XMB = 180°
Therefore,
✁XMB = 45°
✁BMY =
(AB || RS, Alternate angles)
Therefore,
✁BMY = 40°
Adding (1) and (2), you get
✁XMB +
✁BMY = 45° + 40°
That is,
✁XMY = 85°
Example 5 : If a transversal intersects two lines such that the bisectors of a pair of
corresponding angles are parallel, then prove that the two lines are parallel.
Solution : In Fig. 6.26, a transversal AD intersects two lines PQ and RS at points B
and C respectively. Ray BE is the bisector of ✁ABQ and ray CG is the bisector of
✁BCS; and BE || CG.
We are to prove that PQ || RS.
It is given that ray BE is the bisector of
✁ABQ.
Therefore,
✁ABE = 1
2  ✁ABQ
Similarly, ray CG is the bisector of
✁BCS.
Therefore,
✁BCG = 1
2  ✁BCS
But BE || CG and AD is the transversal.
Therefore,
✁ABE =
(Corresponding angles axiom)
Substituting (1) and (2) in (3), you get
2  ✁ABQ = 1
2  ✁BCS
That is,
✁ABQ =

But, they are the corresponding angles formed by transversal AD with PQ and RS;
and are equal.
Therefore,
PQ || RS
(Converse of corresponding angles axiom)
Example 6 : In Fig. 6.27, AB || CD and CD || EF. Also EA
✂ AB. If
✁BEF = 55°, find
the values of x, y and z.
Solution :
y + 55° = 180°
(Interior angles on the same side of the
of the transversal ED)
Therefore,
y = 180º – 55º = 125º
Again
x = y
(AB || CD, Corresponding angles axiom)
Therefore
x = 125º
Now, since AB || CD and CD || EF, therefore, AB || EF.
✁EAB + ✁FEA = 180°
(Interior angles on the same
side of the transversal EA)
Therefore,
90° + z + 55° = 180°
Which gives
z = 35°

6.7 Angle Sum Property of a Triangle
In the earlier classes, you have studied through activities that the sum of all the angles
of a triangle is 180°. We can prove this statement using the axioms and theorems
related to parallel lines.
Theorem 6.7 : The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180º.
Proof : Let us see what is given in the statement
above, that is, the hypothesis and what we need to
prove. We are given a triangle PQR and
✁3 are the angles of
✄PQR (see Fig. 6.34).
We need to prove that ✁1 +
✁2 + ✁3 = 180°. Let
us draw a line XPY parallel to QR through the
opposite vertex P, as shown in Fig. 6.35, so that we
can use the properties related to parallel lines.
Now, XPY is a line.
Therefore,
✁4 + ✁1 + ✁5 = 180°
But XPY || QR and PQ, PR are transversals.
✁4 = ✁2
✁5 = ✁3
(Pairs of alternate angles)
Substituting
✁4 and
✁5 in (1), we get
✁2 + ✁1 + ✁3 = 180°
That is,
✁1 + ✁2 + ✁3 = 180°
 Recall that you have studied about the formation of an exterior angle of a triangle in
the earlier classes (see Fig. 6.36). Side QR is produced to point S,
✁PRS is called an
exterior angle of
✄PQR.
✁3 + ✁4 = 180°? (Why?)
Also, see that
✁2 + ✁3 = 180° (Why?)
From (1) and (2), you can see that
✁1 + ✁2.
This result can be stated in the form of
a theorem as given below:
Fig. 6.34
Fig. 6.35
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
Theorem 6.8 : If a side of a triangle is produced, then the exterior angle so
formed is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.
It is obvious from the above theorem that an exterior angle of a triangle is greater
than either of its interior apposite angles.
Now, let us solve some examples based on the above
theorems.
Example 7 : In Fig. 6.37, if QT
✂ PR,
✁TQR = 40°
✁SPR = 30°, find x and y.
Solution : In
✄TQR, 90° + 40° + x = 180°
(Angle sum property of a triangle)
Therefore,
x = 50°
✁SPR + x
(Theorem 6.8)
Therefore,
y = 30° + 50°
= 80°
Example 8 : In Fig. 6.38, the sides AB and AC of
✄ABC are produced to points E and D respectively.
If bisectors BO and CO of
✁CBE and
respectively meet at point O, then prove that
✁BOC = 90° – 1
✁BAC.
Solution : Ray BO is the bisector of
✁CBE.
Therefore,
✁CBO = 1
2  ✁CBE
2  (180° – y)
= 90° – 2
Similarly, ray CO is the bisector of
✁BCD.
Therefore,
✁BCO = 1
2  ✁BCD
2  (180° – z)
= 90° – 2

✁BOC + 90° – 2
z  + 90° – 2
y  = 180°

= 90° – 2

6.8 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of the two adjacent angles so formed is 180° and vice-
versa. This property is called as the Linear pair axiom.
If two lines intersect each other, then the vertically opposite angles are equal.
If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then
each pair of corresponding angles is equal,
(ii) each pair of alternate interior angles is equal,
(iii) each pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary.
If a transversal intersects two lines such that, either
any one pair of corresponding angles is equal, or
(ii) any one pair of alternate interior angles is equal, or
(iii) any one pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary,
then the lines are parallel.
Lines which are parallel to a given line are parallel to each other.
The sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
If a side of a triangle is produced, the exterior angle so formed is equal to the sum of the two
interior opposite angles.

CHAPTER 7
TRIANGLES
7.1 Introduction
You have studied about triangles and their various properties in your earlier classes.
You know that a closed figure formed by three intersecting lines is called a triangle.
(‘Tri’ means ‘three’). A triangle has three sides, three angles and three vertices. For
example, in triangle ABC, denoted as
✂ ABC (see Fig. 7.1); AB, BC, CA are the three
sides,
✄C are the three angles and A, B, C are three vertices.
In Chapter 6, you have also studied some properties
of triangles. In this chapter, you will study in details
about the congruence of triangles, rules of congruence,
some more properties of triangles and inequalities in
a triangle. You have already verified most of these
properties in earlier classes. We will now prove some
of them.
7.2 Congruence of Triangles
You must have observed that two copies of your photographs of the same size are
identical. Similarly, two bangles of the same size, two ATM cards issued by the same
bank are identical. You may recall that on placing a one rupee coin on another minted
in the same year, they cover each other completely.
Do you remember what such figures are called? Indeed they are called congruent
figures (‘congruent’ means equal in all respects or figures whose shapes and sizes
are both the same).
Now, draw two circles of the same radius and place one on the other. What do
you observe? They cover each other completely and we call them as congruent circles.
Fig. 7.1
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Repeat this activity by placing one
square on the other with sides of the same
measure (see Fig. 7.2) or by placing two
equilateral triangles of equal sides on each
other. You will observe that the squares are
congruent to each other and so are the
equilateral triangles.
You may wonder why we are studying congruence. You all must have seen the ice
tray in your refrigerator. Observe that the moulds for making ice are all congruent.
The cast used for moulding in the tray also has congruent depressions (may be all are
rectangular or all circular or all triangular). So, whenever identical objects have to be
produced, the concept of congruence is used in making the cast.
Sometimes, you may find it difficult to replace the refill in your pen by a new one
and this is so when the new refill is not of the same size as the one you want to
remove. Obviously, if the two refills are identical or congruent, the new refill fits.
So, you can find numerous examples where congruence of objects is applied in
daily life situations.
Can you think of some more examples of congruent figures?
Now, which of the following figures are not congruent to the square in
Fig 7.3 (i) :
Fig. 7.3
The large squares in Fig. 7.3 (ii) and (iii) are obviously not congruent to the one in
Fig 7.3 (i), but the square in Fig 7.3 (iv) is congruent to the one given in Fig 7.3 (i).
Let us now discuss the congruence of two triangles.
You already know that two triangles are congruent if the sides and angles of one
triangle are equal to the corresponding sides and angles of the other triangle.
Fig. 7.2
TRIANGLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Now, which of the triangles given below are congruent to triangle ABC in
Fig. 7.4 (i)?
Fig. 7.4
Cut out each of these triangles from Fig. 7.4 (ii) to (v) and turn them around and
try to cover
✂ABC. Observe that triangles in Fig. 7.4 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are congruent
✂ABC while
✂TSU of Fig 7.4 (v) is not congruent to
✂ABC.
✂PQR is congruent to
✂ABC, we write
✂ABC.
Notice that when
✂ABC, then sides of
✂PQR fall on corresponding
equal sides of
✂ABC and so is the case for the angles.
That is, PQ covers AB, QR covers BC and RP covers CA;
✄P  covers
✄Q covers
✄B and
✄R covers
✄C. Also, there is a one-one correspondence
between the vertices. That is, P corresponds to A, Q to B, R to C and so on which is
written as
✆ A, Q
✆ B, R
Note that under this correspondence,
✂ABC; but it will not be correct to
write
✂ABC.
Similarly, for Fig. 7.4 (iii),
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
✆ AB, DE
✆ BC and EF ✆ CA
F ✆ A, D
✆ B and E ✆ C
✂ABC but writing
✂ABC is not correct.
Give the correspondence between the triangle in Fig. 7.4 (iv) and
✂ABC.
So, it is necessary to write the correspondence of vertices correctly for writing of
congruence of triangles in symbolic form.
Note that in congruent triangles corresponding parts are equal and we write
in short ‘CPCT’ for corresponding parts of congruent triangles.
7.3 Criteria for Congruence of Triangles
In earlier classes, you have learnt four criteria for congruence of triangles. Let us
recall them.
Draw two triangles with one side 3 cm. Are these triangles congruent? Observe
that they are not congruent (see Fig. 7.5).
Fig. 7.5
Now, draw two triangles with one side 4 cm and one angle 50° (see Fig. 7.6). Are
they congruent?
Fig. 7.6
TRIANGLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
See that these two triangles are not congruent.
Repeat this activity with some more pairs of triangles.
So, equality of one pair of sides or one pair of sides and one pair of angles is not
sufficient to give us congruent triangles.
What would happen if the other pair of arms (sides) of the equal angles are also
equal?
In Fig 7.7, BC = QR,
✄Q and also, AB = PQ. Now, what can you say
about congruence of
  ABC and
  PQR?
Recall from your earlier classes that, in this case, the two triangles are congruent.
Verify this for
✂ABC and
✂PQR in Fig. 7.7.
Repeat this activity with other pairs of triangles. Do you observe that the equality
of two sides and the included angle is enough for the congruence of triangles? Yes, it
is enough.
Fig. 7.7
This is the first criterion for congruence of triangles.
Axiom 7.1 (SAS congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two sides
and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the sides and the included
angle of the other triangle.
This result cannot be proved with the help of previously known results and so it is
accepted true as an axiom (see Appendix 1).
Let us now take some examples.
Example 1 : In Fig. 7.8, OA = OB and OD = OC. Show that
✂BOC and
(ii) AD || BC.
Solution : (i) You may observe that in
✂AOD and
✂BOC,
OA = OB
(given)
OD = OC
Fig. 7.8
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Also, since ✄AOD and ✄BOC form a pair of vertically opposite angles, we have
✄AOD =
✄BOC.
(by the SAS congruence rule)
(ii) In congruent triangles AOD and BOC, the other corresponding parts are also
equal.
✄OAD =
✄OBC and these form a pair of alternate angles for line segments
AD and BC.
Therefore,
AD || BC.
Example 2 : AB is a line segment and line l is its perpendicular bisector. If a point P
lies on l, show that P is equidistant from A and B.
Solution : Line l
✝ AB and passes through C which
is the mid-point of AB (see Fig. 7.9). You have to
show that PA = PB. Consider
✂PCA and
✂PCB.
We have
AC = BC
(C is the mid-point of AB)
✄PCA =
✄PCB = 90°
(Given)
PC = PC
(Common)
✂PCB (SAS rule)
and so, PA = PB, as they are corresponding sides of
congruent triangles.
Now, let us construct two triangles, whose sides are 4 cm and 5 cm and one of the
angles is 50° and this angle is not included in between the equal sides (see Fig. 7.10).
Are the two triangles congruent?
Fig. 7.10
Fig. 7.9
TRIANGLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Notice that the two triangles are not congruent.
Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that for triangles
to be congruent, it is very important that the equal angles are included between the
pairs of equal sides.
So, SAS congruence rule holds but not ASS or SSA rule.
Next, try to construct the two triangles in which two angles are 60° and 45° and
the side included between these angles is 4 cm (see Fig. 7.11).
Fig. 7.11
Cut out these triangles and place one triangle on the other. What do you observe?
See that one triangle covers the other completely; that is, the two triangles are congruent.
Repeat this activity with more pairs of triangles. You will observe that equality of two
angles and the included side is sufficient for congruence of triangles.
This result is the Angle-Side-Angle criterion for congruence and is written as
ASA criterion. You have verified this criterion in earlier classes, but let us state and
prove this result.
Since this result can be proved, it is called a theorem and to prove it, we use the
SAS axiom for congruence.
Theorem 7.1  (ASA congruence rule) : Two triangles are congruent if two angles
and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included
side of other triangle.
Proof : We are given two triangles ABC and DEF in which:
BC = EF
We need to prove that
For proving the congruence of the two triangles see that three cases arise.

Case (i) : Let AB = DE (see Fig. 7.12).
Now what do you observe? You may observe that
AB = DE
(Assumed)
(Given)
BC = EF
(Given)
(By SAS rule)
Fig. 7.12
Case (ii) : Let if possible AB > DE. So, we can take a point P on AB such that
PB = DE. Now consider
✂PBC and
✂DEF (see Fig. 7.13).
Fig. 7.13
Observe that in
✂PBC and
✂DEF,
PB = DE

BC = EF

So, we can conclude that:
✂DEF, by the SAS axiom for congruence.

Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts will be equal.

✄ACB =

Is this possible?
This is possible only if P coincides with A.
BA = ED
(by SAS axiom)
Case (iii) : If AB < DE, we can choose a point M on DE such that ME = AB and
repeating the arguments as given in Case (ii),  we can conclude that AB = DE and so,
✂DEF.
 Suppose, now in two triangles two pairs of angles and one pair of corresponding
sides are equal but the side is not included between the corresponding equal pairs of
angles. Are the triangles still congruent? You will observe that they are congruent.
Can you reason out why?
You know that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180°. So if two pairs of
angles are equal, the third pair is also equal (180° – sum of equal angles).
So, two triangles are congruent if any two pairs of angles and one pair of
corresponding sides are equal. We may call it as the AAS Congruence Rule.
Now let us perform the following activity :
Draw triangles with angles 40°, 50° and 90°. How many such triangles can you
draw?
In fact, you can draw as many triangles as you want with different lengths of
sides (see Fig. 7.14).

Observe that the triangles may or may not be congruent to each other.
So, equality of three angles is not sufficient for congruence of triangles. Therefore,
for congruence of triangles out of three equal parts, one has to be a side.
Let us now take some more examples.
Example 3 : Line-segment AB is parallel to another line-segment CD. O is the
mid-point of AD (see Fig. 7.15). Show that (i)
✂DOC (ii) O is also the
mid-point of BC.
Solution : (i) Consider
✂AOB and
✂DOC.
✄ABO =
(Alternate angles as AB || CD

✄AOB =

OA = OD
(Given)
Therefore,
(AAS rule)
OB = OC
(CPCT)
So, O is the mid-point of BC.

7.4 Some Properties of a Triangle
In the above section you have studied two criteria for congruence of triangles. Let us
now apply these results to study some properties related to a triangle whose two sides
are equal.

Perform the activity given below:
Construct a triangle in which two sides are
equal, say each equal to 3.5 cm and the third side
equal to 5 cm (see Fig. 7.24). You have done such
constructions in earlier classes.
Do you remember what is such a triangle
called?
A triangle in which two sides are equal is called
an isosceles triangle. So,
✂ABC of Fig. 7.24 is
an isosceles triangle with AB = AC.
Now, measure
✄B and
✄C. What do you observe?
Repeat this activity with other isosceles triangles with different sides.
You may observe that in each such triangle, the angles opposite to the equal sides
are equal.
This is a very important result and is indeed true for any isosceles triangle. It can
be proved as shown below.
Theorem 7.2 : Angles opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal.
This result can be proved in many ways. One of
the proofs is given here.
Proof : We are given an isosceles triangle ABC
in which AB = AC. We need to prove that
Let us draw the bisector of
✄A and let D be
the point of intersection of this bisector of
✄A and BC (see Fig. 7.25).
✂BAD and
✂CAD,
AB = AC
(Given)
✄BAD =
(By construction)
AD = AD
(Common)
(By SAS rule)
✄ABD =
✄ACD, since they are corresponding angles of congruent triangles.

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Is the converse also true? That is:
If two angles of any triangle are equal, can we conclude that the sides opposite to
them are also equal?
Perform the following activity.
Construct a triangle ABC with BC of any length and
✄ B =
✄ C = 50°. Draw the
bisector of
✄A and let it intersect BC at D (see Fig. 7.26).
Cut out the triangle from the sheet of paper and fold it along AD so that vertex C
falls on vertex B.
What can you say about sides AC and AB?
Observe that AC covers AB completely
AC = AB
Repeat this activity with some more triangles.
Each time you will observe that the sides opposite
to equal angles are equal. So we have the
following:
Theorem 7.3 : The sides opposite to equal angles of a triangle are equal.
This is the converse of Theorem 7.2.
You can prove this theorem by ASA congruence rule.
Let us take some examples to apply these results.
Example 4 : In
✂ABC, the bisector AD of
✄A is perpendicular to side BC
(see Fig. 7.27). Show that AB = AC and
✂ABC is isosceles.
Solution : In
✂ABD and
✂ACD,
✄BAD =
(Given)
AD = AD
(Common)
✄ADB =
✄ADC = 90°

Show that BF = CE.

Example 6 : In an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC, D and E are points on BC
such that BE = CD (see Fig. 7.29). Show that AD = AE.
Solution : In
✂ABD and
✂ACE,
AB = AC
(Given)
(Angles opposite to equal sides)   (2)
Also,
BE = CD
BE – DE = CD – DE
That is,
BD = CE
(Using (1), (2), (3) and SAS rule).
This gives
AD = AE

7.5 Some More Criteria for Congruence of Triangles
You have seen earlier in this chapter that equality of three angles of one triangle to
three angles of the other is not sufficient for the congruence of the two triangles. You
may wonder whether equality of three sides of one triangle to three sides of another
triangle is enough for congruence of the two triangles. You have already verified in
earlier classes that this is indeed true.
To be sure, construct two triangles with sides 4 cm, 3.5 cm and 4.5 cm
(see Fig. 7.35). Cut them out and place them on each other. What do you observe?
They cover each other completely, if the equal sides are placed on each other. So, the
triangles are congruent.
Fig. 7.35
Repeat this activity with some more triangles. We arrive at another rule for
congruence.
Theorem 7.4 (SSS congruence rule) : If three sides of one triangle are equal to
the three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
This theorem can be proved using a suitable construction.
You have already seen that in the SAS congruence rule, the pair of equal angles
has to be the included angle between the pairs of corresponding pair of equal sides and
if this is not so, the two triangles may not  be congruent.
Perform this activity:
Construct two right angled triangles with hypotenuse equal to 5 cm and one side
equal to 4 cm each (see Fig. 7.36).
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Fig. 7.36
Cut them out and place one triangle over the other with equal side placed on each
other. Turn the  triangles, if necessary. What do you observe?
The two triangles cover each other completely and so they are congruent. Repeat
this activity with other pairs of right triangles. What do you observe?
You will find that two right triangles are congruent if one pair of sides and the
hypotenuse are equal. You have verified this in earlier classes.
Note that, the right angle is not the included angle in this case.
So, you arrive at the following congruence rule:
Theorem 7.5 (RHS congruence rule) : If in two right triangles the hypotenuse
and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of the
other triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
Note that RHS stands for Right angle - Hypotenuse - Side.
Let us now take some examples.
Example 7 : AB is a line-segment. P and Q are
points on opposite sides of AB such that each of them
is equidistant from the points A and B (see Fig. 7.37).
Show that the line PQ is the perpendicular bisector
of AB.
Solution : You are given that PA = PB and
QA = QB and you are to show that PQ
✝ AB and
PQ bisects AB. Let PQ inersect AB at C.
Can you think of two congruent triangles in this figure?
Let us take
✂PAQ and
✂PBQ.
In these triangles,
Fig. 7.37

AP = BP
(Given)
AQ = BQ
(Given)
PQ = PQ
(Common)
(SSS rule)
Therefore,
✄APQ =
(CPCT).
Now let us consider
  PAC and
  PBC.
You have :
AP = BP
(Given)
✄APC =
✄BPC (✄APQ =
✄BPQ proved above)
PC = PC
(Common)

Therefore,
AC = BC
(CPCT) (1)
✄ACP =
(CPCT)
Also,
✄ACP +
✄BCP = 180°
(Linear pair)
2✄ACP  = 180°
✄ACP  = 90°
From (1) and (2), you can easily conclude that PQ is the perpendicular bisector of AB.
[Note that, without showing the congruence of
  PAQ and
  PBQ, you cannot show
  PAC
  PBC even though AP = BP
(Given)
PC = PC
(Common)
✄PAC =
✄PBC (Angles opposite to equal sides in

congruence of triangles. Also the angle is not included between the equal pairs of
sides.]
Let us take some more examples.
Example 8 : P is a point equidistant from two lines l and m intersecting at point A
(see Fig. 7.38). Show that the line AP bisects the angle between them.
Solution : You are given that lines l and m intersect  each other at A. Let PB

7.6 Inequalities in a Triangle
So far, you have been mainly studying the equality of sides and angles of a triangle or
triangles. Sometimes, we do come across unequal objects, we need to compare them.
For example, line-segment AB is greater in length as compared to line segment CD in
Fig. 7.41 (i) and
✄A is greater than
✄B in Fig 7.41 (ii).
Fig. 7.41
Let us now examine whether there is any relation between unequal sides and
unequal angles of a triangle. For this, let us perform the following activity:
Activity : Fix two pins on a drawing board say at B and C and tie a thread to mark a
side BC of a triangle.
Fix one end of another thread at C and tie a pencil
at the other (free) end . Mark a point A with the
pencil and draw
✂ABC (see Fig 7.42). Now, shift
the pencil and mark another point A
✞ on CA beyond
A (new position of it)
✞C > AC
(Comparing the lengths)
Join A
✞ to B and complete the triangle A
What can you say about
✞BC and
✄ABC?
Compare them. What do you observe?
Clearly,
✞BC >
Continue to mark more points on CA (extended) and draw the triangles with the
side BC and the points marked.
You will observe that as the length of the side AC is increased (by taking different
positions of A), the angle opposite to it, that is,
✄B also increases.
Let us now perform another activity :
Fig. 7.42
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Activity : Construct a scalene triangle (that is a triangle in which all sides are of
different lengths). Measure the lengths of the sides.
Now, measure the angles. What do you
observe?
✂ABC of Fig 7.43, BC is the longest side
and AC is the shortest side.
Also,
✄A is the largest and
✄B is the smallest.
Repeat this activity with some other triangles.
We arrive at a very important result of inequalities in a triangle. It is stated in the
form of a theorem as shown below:
Theorem 7.6 : If two sides of a triangle are unequal, the angle opposite to the
longer side is larger (or greater).
You may prove this theorem by taking a point P
on BC such that CA = CP in Fig. 7.43.
Now, let us perform another activity :
Activity : Draw a line-segment AB. With A as centre
and some radius, draw an arc and mark different
points say P, Q, R, S, T  on it.
Join each of these points with A as well as with B (see Fig. 7.44). Observe that as
we move from P to T,
✄A is becoming larger and larger. What is happening to the
length of the side opposite to it? Observe that the length of the side is also increasing;
that is
✄TAB >
✄SAB >
✄RAB >
✄QAB >
✄PAB and TB > SB > RB > QB > PB.
Now, draw any triangle with all angles unequal
to each other. Measure the lengths of the sides
(see Fig. 7.45).
Observe that the side opposite to the largest angle
is the longest. In Fig. 7.45,
✄B is the largest angle
and AC is the longest side.
Repeat this activity for some more triangles and
we see that the converse of Theorem 7.6 is also true.
In this way, we arrive at the following theorem:

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-7\Chap-7 (02-01-2006) PM65
Theorem 7.7 : In any triangle, the side opposite to the larger (greater)  angle is
longer.
This theorem can be proved by the method of contradiction.
Now take a triangle ABC and in it, find AB + BC, BC + AC and AC + AB. What
do you observe?
You will observe that
AB + BC > AC,
BC + AC > AB  and AC + AB > BC.
Repeat this activity with other triangles and with this you can arrive at the following
theorem :
Theorem 7.8 : The sum of any two sides of a
triangle is greater than the third side.
In Fig. 7.46, observe that the side BA of
✂ ABC has
been produced to a point D such that AD = AC. Can you
show that
✄ BCD >
✄ BDC and BA + AC > BC? Have
you arrived at the proof of the above theorem.
Let us now take some examples based on these results.
Example 9 : D is a point on side BC of
✂ ABC such that AD = AC (see Fig. 7.47).
Show that AB > AD.
Solution : In
✂DAC,

CHAPTER 8
QUADRILATERALS
8.1 Introduction
You have studied many properties of a triangle in Chapters 6 and 7 and you know that
on joining three non-collinear points in pairs, the figure so obtained is a triangle. Now,
let us mark four points and see what we obtain on joining them in pairs in some order.
Fig. 8.1
Note that if all the points are collinear (in the same line), we obtain a line
segment [see Fig. 8.1 (i)], if three out of four points are collinear, we get a triangle
[see Fig. 8.1 (ii)], and if no three points out of four are collinear, we obtain a closed
figure with four sides [see Fig. 8.1 (iii) and (iv)].
Such a figure formed by joining four points in an order is called a quadrilateral.
In this book, we will consider only quadrilaterals of the type given in Fig. 8.1 (iii) but
not as given in Fig. 8.1 (iv).
A quadrilateral has four sides, four angles and four vertices [see Fig. 8.2 (i)].
Fig. 8.2
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
In quadrilateral ABCD, AB, BC, CD and DA are the four sides; A, B, C and D are
the four vertices and
✁C and
✁D are the four angles formed at the
vertices.
Now join the opposite vertices A to C and B to D [see Fig. 8.2 (ii)].
AC and BD are the two diagonals of the quadrilateral  ABCD.
In this chapter, we will study more about different types of quadrilaterals, their
properties and especially those of parallelograms.
You may wonder why should we study about quadrilaterals (or parallelograms)
Look around you and you will find so many objects which are of the shape of a
quadrilateral - the floor, walls, ceiling, windows of your classroom, the blackboard,
each face of the duster, each page of your book, the top of your study table etc. Some
of these are given below (see Fig. 8.3).
Fig. 8.3
Although most of the objects we see around are of the shape of special quadrilateral
called rectangle, we shall study more about quadrilaterals and especially parallelograms
because a rectangle is also a parallelogram and all properties of a parallelogram are
true for a rectangle as well.
8.2 Angle Sum Property of a Quadrilateral
Let us now recall the angle sum property of a
quadrilateral.
The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360º.
This can be verified by drawing a diagonal and dividing
the quadrilateral into two triangles.
Let ABCD be a quadrilateral and AC be a
diagonal (see Fig. 8.4).
What is the sum of angles in
✂ADC?

✁ACD +
✁ACB  =
✁C = 360°.
i.e., the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.
8.3 Types of Quadrilaterals
Look at the different quadrilaterals drawn below:
Fig. 8.5
Observe that :
 One pair of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD in Fig. 8.5 (i) namely, AB
and CD are parallel. You know that it is called a trapezium.
 Both pairs of opposite sides of quadrilaterals given in Fig. 8.5 (ii), (iii) , (iv)
and (v) are parallel. Recall that such quadrilaterals are called parallelograms.
So, quadrilateral PQRS of Fig. 8.5 (ii) is a parallelogram.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
Similarly, all quadrilaterals given in Fig. 8.5 (iii), (iv) and (v) are parallelograms.
 In parallelogram MNRS of Fig. 8.5 (iii), note that one of its angles namely
✁M is a right angle. What is this special parallelogram called? Try to recall.
It is called a rectangle.
 The parallelogram DEFG of Fig. 8.5 (iv) has all sides equal and we know that
it is called a rhombus.
 The parallelogram ABCD of Fig. 8.5 (v) has
✁A = 90° and all sides equal; it
is called a square.
 In quadrilateral ABCD of Fig. 8.5 (vi), AD = CD and AB = CB i.e., two pairs
of adjacent sides are equal. It is not a parallelogram. It is called a kite.
Note that a square, rectangle and rhombus are all parallelograms.
 A square is a rectangle and also a rhombus.
 A parallelogram is a trapezium.
 A kite is not a parallelogram.
 A trapezium is not a parallelogram (as only one pair of opposite sides is parallel
in a trapezium and we require both pairs to be parallel in a parallelogram).
 A rectangle or a rhombus is not a square.
Look at the Fig. 8.6. We have a rectangle and a parallelogram with same perimeter
14 cm.
Fig. 8.6
Here the area of the parallelogram is DP × AB and this is less than the area of the
rectangle i.e., AB × AD as DP < AD. Generally sweet shopkeepers cut ‘Burfis’ in the
shape of a parallelogram to accomodate more pieces in the same tray (see the shape
of the Burfi before you eat it next time!).
Let us now review some properties of a parallelogram learnt in earlier classes.

8.4 Properties of a Parallelogram
Let us perform an activity.
Cut out a parallelogram from a sheet of paper
and cut it along a diagonal (see Fig. 8.7). You obtain
two triangles. What can you say about these
triangles?
Place one triangle over the other. Turn one around,
if necessary. What do you observe?
Observe that the two triangles are congruent to
each other.
Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms. Each time you will observe
that each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.
Let us now prove this result.
Theorem 8.1 : A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent
triangles.
Proof : Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC be a diagonal (see Fig. 8.8). Observe
that the diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two triangles, namely,
✂CDA. We need to prove that these triangles are congruent.
✂ABC and
✂CDA, note that BC || AD and AC is a transversal.
✁BCA =
✁DAC (Pair of alternate angles)
Also,
AB || DC and AC is a transversal.
✁BAC =
✁DCA (Pair of alternate angles)
AC = CA
(Common)
(ASA rule)
diagonal AC divides parallelogram ABCD into two congruent
triangles ABC and CDA.
 Now, measure the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD. What do you observe?
You will find that AB = DC and AD = BC.
This is another property of a parallelogram stated below:
Theorem 8.2 : In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.
You have already proved that a diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent
Fig. 8.7
Fig. 8.8
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
triangles; so what can you say about the corresponding parts say, the corresponding
sides? They are equal.
AB = DC
AD = BC
Now what is the converse of this result? You already know that whatever is given
in a theorem, the same is to be proved in the converse and whatever is proved in the
theorem it is given in the converse. Thus, Theorem 8.2 can be stated as given below :
If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal. So
its converse is :
Theorem 8.3 : If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it
is a parallelogram.
Can you reason out why?
Let sides AB and CD of the quadrilateral ABCD
be equal and also  AD = BC (see Fig. 8.9). Draw
diagonal AC.
Clearly,
(Why?)
✁BAC =
✁BCA =
(Why?)
Can you now say that ABCD is a parallelogram? Why?
You have just seen that in a parallelogram each pair of opposite sides is equal and
conversely if each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then it is a
parallelogram. Can we conclude the same result for the pairs of opposite angles?
Draw a parallelogram and measure its angles. What do you observe?
Each pair of opposite angles is equal.
Repeat this with some more parallelograms. We arrive at yet another result as
given below.
Theorem 8.4 : In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal.
Now, is the converse of this result also true? Yes. Using the angle sum property of
a quadrilateral and the results of parallel lines intersected by a transversal, we can see
that the converse is also true. So, we have the following theorem :
Theorem 8.5 : If in a quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is equal, then
it is a parallelogram.
Fig. 8.9
QUADRILATERALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
There is yet another property of a parallelogram. Let us study the same. Draw a
parallelogram ABCD and draw both its diagonals intersecting at the point O
(see Fig. 8.10).
Measure the lengths of OA, OB, OC and OD.
What do you observe? You will observe that
OA = OC
OB = OD.
O is the mid-point of both the diagonals.
Repeat this activity with some more parallelograms.
Each time you will find that O is the mid-point of both the diagonals.
So, we have the following theorem :
Theorem 8.6 : The diagonals of a parallelogram
bisect each other.
Now, what would happen, if in a quadrilateral
the diagonals bisect each other? Will it be a
parallelogram? Indeed this is true.
This result is the converse of the result of
Theorem 8.6. It is given below:
Theorem 8.7 : If the diagonals of a quadrilateral
bisect each other, then it is a parallelogram.
You can reason out this result as follows:
Note that in Fig. 8.11, it is given that OA = OC
and OB = OD.
(Why?)
Therefore,
✁ABO =
(Why?)
From this, we get AB || CD
Similarly,
BC || AD
Therefore ABCD is a parallelogram.
Let us now take some examples.
Example 1 : Show that each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.
Solution : Let us recall what a rectangle is.
A rectangle is a parallelogram in which one angle is a
Fig. 8.10
Fig. 8.11
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
right angle.
Let ABCD be a rectangle in which
✁A = 90°.
We have to show that
✁D = 90°
We have, AD || BC and AB is a transversal
(see Fig. 8.12).
✁B = 180°
(Interior angles on the same
side of the transversal)
✁A = 90°
✁B = 180° –
✁A = 180° – 90° = 90°
✁A and
(Opposite angles of the parallellogram)
✁C = 90° and
✁D = 90°.
Therefore, each of the angles of a rectangle is a right angle.
Example 2 : Show that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
Solution : Consider the rhombus ABCD (see Fig. 8.13).
You know that  AB = BC = CD = DA (Why?)
Now, in
✂AOD and
✂COD,
OA = OC (Diagonals of a parallelogram
bisect each other)
OD = OD
(Common)
AD = CD
Therefore,
(SSS congruence rule)
This gives,
✁AOD =
(CPCT)
✁AOD +
✁COD = 180° (Linear pair)
✁AOD = 180°
✁AOD = 90°
So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
Example 3 : ABC is an isosceles triangle in which AB = AC. AD bisects exterior
Fig. 8.12
Fig. 8.13
QUADRILATERALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
angle PAC and CD || AB (see Fig. 8.14). Show that
✁DAC =
✁BCA and
(ii) ABCD is a parallelogram.
Solution : (i)
✂ABC is isosceles in which AB = AC (Given)
✁ABC =
(Angles opposite to equal sides)
Also,
✁PAC =
✁ABC +
(Exterior angle of a triangle)
✁PAC = 2
Now, AD bisects
✁PAC.
✁PAC = 2
Therefore,
✁DAC = 2
[From (1) and (2)]
✁DAC =
(ii) Now, these equal angles form a pair of alternate angles when line segments BC
and AD are intersected by a transversal AC.
BC || AD
Also,
BA || CD
(Given)
Now, both pairs of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel.
So, ABCD is a parallelogram.
Example 4 : Two parallel lines l and m are intersected by a transversal p
(see Fig. 8.15). Show that the quadrilateral formed by the bisectors of interior angles
is a rectangle.
Solution : It is given that PS || QR and transversal p intersects them at points A and
C respectively.
The bisectors of
✁PAC and
✁ACQ intersect at B and bisectors of
✁ACR and
✁SAC intersect at D.
We are to show that quadrilateral ABCD is a
rectangle.
✁PAC =
(Alternate angles as l || m and p is a transversal)
✁PAC = 1
i.e.,
✁BAC =
Fig. 8.14
Fig. 8.15
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
These form a pair of alternate angles for lines AB and DC with AC as transversal and
they are equal also.
AB || DC
Similarly,
BC || AD
(Considering ✁ACB and ✁CAD)
Therefore, quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.
Also,
✁PAC +
✁CAS = 180°
(Linear pair)
✁PAC + 1
✁CAS = 1
2  × 180° = 90°
✁BAC +
✁CAD = 90°
✁BAD = 90°
So, ABCD is a parallelogram in which one angle is 90°.
Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle.
Example 5 : Show that the bisectors of angles of a parallelogram form a rectangle.
Solution : Let P, Q, R and S be the points of
intersection of the bisectors of
✁A and
✁C and
✁D, and
✁D and
✁A respectively
of parallelogram ABCD (see Fig. 8.16).
✂ASD, what do you observe?
Since DS bisects ✁D and AS bisects
✁A,  therefore,
✁DAS +
✁ADS = 1
2  ✁A + 1
2  (✁A + ✁D)
2  × 180°
(✁A and ✁D are interior angles
on the same side of the transversal)
= 90°
Also,
✁DAS + ✁ADS + ✁DSA = 180°
(Angle sum property of a triangle)
90° + ✁DSA = 180°
✁DSA = 90°
✁PSR = 90°
(Being vertically opposite to
✁DSA)
Fig. 8.16
QUADRILATERALS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
Similarly, it can be shown that ✁APB = 90° or
✁SPQ = 90°  (as it was shown for
✁DSA). Similarly, ✁PQR = 90° and ✁ SRQ = 90°.
So, PQRS is a quadrilateral in which all angles are right angles.
Can we conclude that it is a rectangle? Let us examine. We have shown that
✁PSR = ✁PQR = 90° and ✁SPQ = ✁ SRQ = 90°. So both pairs of opposite angles
are equal.
Therefore, PQRS is a parallelogram in which one angle (in fact all angles) is 90° and
so, PQRS is a rectangle.
8.5 Another Condition for a Quadrilateral to be a Parallelogram
You have studied many properties of a parallelogram in this chapter and you have also
verified that if in a quadrilateral any one of those properties is satisfied, then it becomes
a parallelogram.
We now study yet another condition which is the least required condition for a
quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
It is stated in the form of a theorem as given below:
Theorem 8.8 : A quadrilateral is a parallelogram if a pair of opposite sides is
equal and parallel.
Look at Fig 8.17 in which AB = CD and
AB || CD. Let us draw a diagonal AC. You can show
✂ ABC
✂ CDA by SAS congruence rule.
BC || AD
(Why?)
Let us now take an example to apply this property
of a parallelogram.
Example 6 : ABCD is a parallelogram in which P
and Q are mid-points of opposite sides AB and CD
(see Fig. 8.18). If AQ intersects DP at S and BQ
intersects CP at R, show that:
APCQ is a parallelogram.
(ii) DPBQ is a parallelogram.
(iii) PSQR is a parallelogram.
Fig. 8.17
Fig. 8.18
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-6\Chap-6 (02-01-2006) PM65
Solution : (i) In quadrilateral APCQ,
AP || QC
(Since AB || CD)
AP = 1
2  AB,
CQ = 1
2  CD
(Given)
Also,
AB = CD
(Why?)
AP = QC
Therefore, APCQ is a parallelogram
[From (1) and (2) and Theorem 8.8]
Similarly, quadrilateral DPBQ is a parallelogram, because
DQ || PB and DQ = PB
(iii)
In quadrilateral PSQR,
SP || QR (SP is a part of DP and QR is a part of QB)
Similarly,
SQ || PR
So, PSQR is a parallelogram.

8.6 The Mid-point Theorem
You have studied many properties of a triangle as well as a quadrilateral. Now let us
study yet another result which is related to the mid-point of sides of a triangle. Perform
the following activity.
Draw a triangle and mark the mid-points E and F of two sides of the triangle. Join
the points E and F (see Fig. 8.24).
Measure EF and BC. Measure
✁AEF and
✁ABC.
What do you observe? You will find that :
EF = 1
2  BC and
✁AEF =
EF || BC
Repeat this activity with some more triangles.
So, you arrive at the following theorem:
Theorem 8.9 : The line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle
is parallel to the third side.
You can prove this theorem using the following
clue:
Observe Fig 8.25 in which E and F are mid-points
of AB and AC respectively and CD || BA.
(ASA Rule)
EF = DF and BE = AE = DC
(Why?)
Therefore, BCDE is a parallelogram.
(Why?)
This gives EF || BC.
In this case, also note that EF = 1
2  ED = 1
2 BC.
Can you state the converse of Theorem 8.9? Is the converse true?
You will see that converse of the above theorem is also true which is stated as
below:
Theorem 8.10 : The line drawn through the mid-point of one side of a triangle,
parallel to another side bisects the third side.

In Fig 8.26, observe that E is the mid-point of
AB, line l is passsing through E and is parallel to BC
and CM || BA.
Prove that AF = CF by using the congruence of
✂ AEF and
✂ CDF.
Example 7 : In
✂ABC, D, E and F are respectively
the mid-points of sides AB, BC and CA
(see Fig. 8.27). Show that
✂ABC is divided into four
congruent triangles by joining D, E and F.
Solution : As D and E are mid-points of sides AB
and BC of the triangle ABC, by Theorem 8.9,
DE || AC
Similarly,
DF || BC and EF || AB
Therefore ADEF, BDFE and DFCE are all parallelograms.
Now DE is a diagonal of the parallelogram BDFE,
therefore,
✂ BDE
✂ FED
Similarly
✂ DAF
✂ FED
✂ EFC
✂ FED
So, all the four triangles are congruent.
Example 8 : l, m and n are three parallel lines
intersected by transversals p and q such that l, m
and n cut off equal intercepts AB and BC on p
(see Fig. 8.28). Show that l, m and n cut off equal
intercepts DE and EF on q also.
Solution : We are given that AB = BC and have
to prove that DE = EF.
Let us join A to F intersecting m at G..
The trapezium ACFD is divided into two triangles;

namely
✂ACF and
✂AFD.
✂ACF, it is given that B is the mid-point of AC (AB = BC)
BG || CF
(since m || n).
So, G is the mid-point of AF
(by using Theorem 8.10)
Now, in
✂AFD, we can apply the same argument as G is the mid-point of AF,
GE || AD and so by Theorem 8.10, E is the mid-point of DF,
i.e.,
DE = EF.
In other words, l, m and n cut off equal intercepts on q also.

CHAPTER 9
AREAS OF PARALLELOGRAMS AND TRIANGLES
9.1 Introduction
In Chapter 5, you have seen that the study of Geometry, originated with the
measurement of earth (lands) in the process of recasting boundaries of the fields and
dividing them into appropriate parts. For example, a farmer Budhia had a triangular
field and she wanted to divide it equally among her two daughters and one son. Without
actually calculating the area of the field, she just divided one side of the triangular field
into three equal parts and joined the two points of division to the opposite vertex. In
this way, the field was divided into three parts and she gave one part to each of her
children. Do you think that all the three parts so obtained by her were, in fact, equal in
area? To get answers to this type of questions and other related problems, there is a
need to have a relook at areas of plane figures, which you have already studied in
earlier classes.
You may recall that the part of the plane enclosed by a simple closed figure is
called a planar region corresponding to that figure. The magnitude or measure of this
planar region is called its area. This magnitude or measure is always expressed with
the help of a number (in some unit) such as 5 cm2, 8 m2, 3 hectares etc. So, we can say
that area of a figure is a number (in some unit) associated with the part of the plane
enclosed by the figure.
We are also familiar with the concept
of congruent figures from earlier classes
and from Chapter 7. Two figures are
called congruent, if they have the same
shape and the same size. In other words,
if two figures A and B are congruent
(see Fig. 9.1) , then using a tracing paper,
Fig. 9.1
AREAS OF PARALLELOGRAMS AND TRIANGLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-9\Chap-9 (03-01-2006) PM65
you can superpose one figure over the other such that it will cover the other completely.
So if two figures A and B are congruent, they must have equal areas. However,
the converse of this statement is not true. In other words, two figures having equal
areas need not be congruent. For example, in Fig. 9.2, rectangles ABCD and EFGH
have equal areas (9 × 4 cm2 and 6 × 6 cm2) but clearly they are not congruent. (Why?)
Fig. 9.2
Now let us look at Fig. 9.3 given below:
Fig. 9.3
You may observe that planar region formed by figure T is made up of two planar
regions formed by figures P and Q. You can easily see that
Area of figure T = Area of figure P + Area of figure Q.
You may denote the area of figure A as ar(A), area of figure B as ar(B), area of
figure T as ar(T), and so on. Now you can say that area of a figure is a number
(in some unit) associated with the part of the plane enclosed by the figure with
the following  two properties:
(1) If A and B are two congruent figures, then ar(A) = ar(B);
and (2) if a planar region formed by a figure T is made up of two non-overlapping
planar regions formed by figures P and Q, then  ar(T) = ar(P) + ar(Q).
You are also aware of some formulae for finding the areas of different figures
such  as rectangle, square, parallelogram, triangle etc., from your earlier classes. In
this chapter, attempt shall be made to consolidate the knowledge about these formulae
by studying some relationship between the areas of these geometric figures under the
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-9\Chap-9 (03-01-2006) PM65
condition when they lie on the same base and between the same parallels. This study
will also be useful in the understanding of some results on ‘similarity of triangles’.
9.2 Figures on the Same Base and Between the Same Parallels
Look at the following figures:
Fig. 9.4
In Fig. 9.4(i), trapezium ABCD and parallelogram EFCD have a common side
DC. We say that trapezium ABCD and parallelogram EFCD are on the same base
DC. Similarly, in Fig. 9.4 (ii), parallelograms PQRS and MNRS are on the same base
SR; in Fig. 9.4(iii), triangles ABC and DBC are on the same base BC and in
Fig. 9.4(iv), parallelogram ABCD and triangle PDC are on the same base DC.
Now look at the following figures:
Fig. 9.5
In Fig. 9.5(i), clearly trapezium ABCD and parallelogram EFCD are on the same
base DC. In addition to the above, the vertices A and B (of trapezium ABCD) opposite
to  base DC and the vertices E and F (of parallelogram EFCD) opposite to base DC lie
on a line AF parallel to DC. We say that trapezium ABCD and parallelogram EFCD
are on the same base DC and between the same parallels AF and DC. Similarly,
parallelograms PQRS and MNRS are on the same base SR and between the same

So, two figures are said to be on the same base and between the same parallels,
if they have  a common base (side) and the vertices (or the vertex) opposite to the
common base of each figure lie on a line parallel to the base.
Keeping in view the above statement, you cannot say that
  PQR and
  DQR of
Fig. 9.6(i) lie between the same parallels l and QR. Similarly, you cannot say that
Fig. 9.6
parallelograms EFGH and MNGH of Fig. 9.6(ii) lie between the same parallels EF
and HG and that parallelograms ABCD and EFCD of Fig. 9.6(iii) lie between the
same parallels AB and DC (even
though they have a common base DC
and lie between the parallels AD and
BC). So, it should clearly be noted
that out of the two parallels, one
must be the line containing the
common base.Note that
✁ABC and
✁DBE of Fig. 9.7(i) are not on the
common base. Similarly,
✁ABC and parallelogram PQRS of Fig. 9.7(ii) are also not on
the same base.

9.3 Parallelograms on the  same Base and Between the same Parallels
Now let us try to find a relation, if any, between the areas of two parallelograms on the
same base and between the same parallels. For this, let us perform the following
activities:
Activity 1 : Let us take a graph sheet and draw two parallelograms ABCD and
PQCD on it as shown in Fig. 9.9.
Fig. 9.9
The above two parallelograms are on the same base DC and between the same
parallels PB and DC. You may recall the method of finding the areas of these two
parallelograms by counting the squares.
In this method, the area is found by counting the number of complete squares
enclosed by the figure, the number of squares a having more than half their parts
enclosed by the figure and the number of squares having half their parts enclosed by
the figure. The squares whose less than half parts are enclosed by the figure are
ignored. You will find that areas of both the parallelograms are (approximately) 15cm2.
Repeat this activity* by drawing some more pairs of parallelograms on the graph
sheet. What do you observe? Are the areas of the two parallelograms different or
equal? If fact, they are equal. So, this may lead you to conclude that parallelograms
on the same base and between the same parallels are equal in area. However,
remember that this is just a verification.
Activity 2 : Draw a parallelogram ABCD on a thick
sheet of paper or on a cardboard sheet. Now, draw a
line-segment DE as shown in Fig. 9.10.
*This activity can also be performed by using a Geoboard.
Fig. 9.10

Next, cut a triangle A
✂ congruent to
triangle ADE on a separate sheet with the help
of a tracing paper and place
✂ in such
a way that A
✂ coincides with BC as shown
in Fig 9.11.Note that there are two
parallelograms ABCD and EE
✂CD on the same
base DC and between the same parallels AE✂
and DC. What can you say about their areas?
✁ ADE
Therefore
ar (ADE) = ar (A✂D
ar (ABCD) = ar (ADE) + ar (EBCD)
= ar (A✂D✂E
✂) + ar (EBCD)
= ar (EE
So, the two parallelograms are equal in area.
Let us now try to prove this relation between the two such parallelograms.
Theorem 9.1 : Parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallels
are equal in area.
Proof :  Two parallelograms ABCD and EFCD, on
the same base DC and between the same parallels
AF and DC are given (see Fig.9.12).
We need to prove that ar (ABCD) = ar (EFCD).
  ADE and
  BCF,
☎DAE =
☎CBF (Corresponding angles from AD || BC and transversal AF)
☎AED =
☎BFC (Corresponding angles from ED || FC and transversal AF)
Therefore,
☎ADE =
☎BCF (Angle sum property of a triangle)
Also,
AD = BC (Opposite sides of the parallelogram ABCD)
  ADE
  BCF
[By ASA rule, using (1), (3), and (4)]
Therefore, ar (ADE) = ar (BCF) (Congruent figures have equal areas)
ar (ABCD) = ar (ADE) + ar (EDCB)
= ar (BCF) + ar (EDCB)
[From(5)]
= ar (EFCD)
So, parallelograms ABCD and EFCD are equal in area.

Let us now take some examples to illustrate the use of the above theorem.
Example 1 : In Fig. 9.13, ABCD is a parallelogram
and EFCD is a rectangle.
Also, AL
   DC. Prove that
(i) ar (ABCD) = ar (EFCD)
(ii) ar (ABCD) = DC × AL
Solution : (i) As a rectangle is also a parallelogram,
therefore,
ar (ABCD) = ar (EFCD)
(Theorem 9.1)
(ii) From above result,
ar (ABCD) = DC × FC (Area of the rectangle = length × breadth)
   DC, therefore, AFCL is also a rectangle
AL = FC
Therefore, ar (ABCD) = DC × AL
[From (1) and (2)]
Can you see from the Result (ii) above that area of a parallelogram is the product
of  its any side and the coresponding altitude. Do you remember that you have
studied this formula for area of a parallelogram in Class VII. On the basis of this
formula, Theorem 9.1 can be rewritten as parallelograms on the same base or
equal bases and between the same parallels are equal in area.
Can you write the converse of the above statement? It is as follows: Parallelograms
on the same base (or equal bases) and having  equal areas lie between the same
parallels. Is the converse true? Prove the converse using the formula for area of the
parallelogram.
Example 2 : If a triangle and a parallelogram are on the same base and between the
same parallels, then prove that the area of the triangle is equal to half the area of the
parallelogram.
Solution : Let
✁ABP and parallelogram ABCD be
on the same base AB and between the same parallels
AB and PC (see Fig. 9.14).
You wish to prove that ar (PAB) = 1 ar(ABCD)
Draw BQ || AP to obtain another parallelogram ABQP. Now parallelograms ABQP
and ABCD are on the same base AB and between the same parallels AB and PC.

Therefore,
ar (ABQP) = ar (ABCD)
(By Theorem 9.1) (1)
  PAB
  BQP (Diagonal PB divides parallelogram ABQP  into two congruent
triangles.)
ar (PAB) = ar (BQP)
Therefore,
ar (PAB) = 1
2  ar (ABQP)

This gives
ar (PAB) = 1 ar (ABCD)
[From (1) and (3)]

CF = 10 cm, find AD.
If  E,F,G and H are respectively the mid-points of
the sides of a parallelogram ABCD, show that
ar (EFGH) = 1 ar (ABCD)

ABCD. Show that ar (APB) = ar (BQC).

(i) ar (PQRS) = ar (ABRS)

A farmer was having a field in the form of a parallelogram PQRS. She took any point A
on RS and joined it to points P and Q. In how many parts the fields is divided? What
are the shapes of these parts? The farmer wants to sow wheat and pulses in equal
portions of the field separately. How should she do it?
9.4 Triangles on the same Base and between the same Parallels
Let us look at Fig. 9.18. In it, you have two triangles
ABC and PBC on the same base BC and between
the same parallels BC and AP. What can you say
about the areas of such triangles? To answer this
question, you may perform the activity of drawing
several pairs of triangles on the same base and
between the same parallels on the graph sheet and
find their areas by the method  of counting  the
squares. Each time, you will find that the areas of the two triangles are (approximately)
equal. This activity can be performed using a geoboard also. You will again find that
the two areas are (approximately) equal.
To obtain a logical answer to the above question,
you may proceed as follows:
In Fig. 9.18, draw CD || BA and CR || BP such
that D and R lie on line AP(see Fig.9.19).
From this, you obtain two parallelograms  PBCR
and ABCD on the same base BC and between the
same parallels BC and AR.
Therefore,
ar (ABCD) = ar (PBCR)
(Why?)
  ABC
  CDA and
  PBC
  CRP
(Why?)
ar (ABC) = 1 ar (ABCD)
and ar (PBC) = 1 ar (PBCR)
(Why?)
Therefore,
ar (ABC) = ar (PBC)
In this way, you have arrived at the following theorem:
Theorem 9.2 : Two triangles on the same base (or equal bases) and between the
same parallels are equal in area.

Now, suppose ABCD is a parallelogram whose one of the diagonals is AC
(see Fig. 9.20). Let AN
   DC. Note that
(Why?)
ar (ADC) = ar (CBA)
(Why?)
Therefore, ar (ADC) = 1 ar (ABCD)
= 1 (DC
(Why?)
area of
✁ADC = 1
2  × base DC × corresponding altitude AN
In other words, area of a triangle is half the product of its base (or any side) and
the corresponding altitude (or height). Do you remember that you have learnt this
formula for area of a triangle in Class VII ? From this formula, you can see that two
triangles with same base (or equal bases) and equal areas will have equal
corresponding altitudes.
For having equal corresponding altitudes, the triangles must lie between the same
parallels. From this, you arrive at the following converse of Theorem 9.2 .
Theorem 9.3 : Two triangles having the same base (or equal bases) and equal
areas lie between the same parallels.
Let us now take some examples to illustrate the use of the above results.
Example 3 : Show that a median of a triangle divides it into two triangles of equal
areas.
Solution : Let ABC be a triangle and let AD be one of its medians (see Fig. 9.21).
You wish to show that
ar (ABD) = ar (ACD).
Since the formula for area involves altitude, let us
draw AN
  BC.
ar(ABD) = 1
2  × base × altitude (of
✁ABD)

Example 4 : In Fig. 9.22, ABCD is a quadrilateral
and BE || AC and also BE meets DC produced at E.
Show that area of
✁ADE is equal to the area of the
quadrilateral ABCD.
Solution : Observe the figure carefully .
✁BAC and
✁EAC lie on the same base AC and
between the same parallels AC and BE.
Therefore,
ar(BAC) = ar(EAC)
(By Theorem 9.2)
So, ar(BAC) + ar(ADC) = ar(EAC) + ar(ADC)
(Adding same areas on both sides)
ar(ABCD) = ar(ADE)
EXERCISE 9.3
In Fig.9.23,  E is any point on median AD of a
✁ABC. Show that ar (ABE) = ar (ACE).
In a triangle ABC, E is the mid-point of median
AD. Show that ar (BED) = 1 ar(ABC)

it into four triangles of equal area.

the same base AB. If line- segment CD is bisected
by AB at O, show that  ar(ABC) = ar (ABD).

by that figure.
Two congruent figures have equal areas but the converse need not be true.

CHAPTER 10
CIRCLES
10.1 Introduction
You may have come across many objects in daily life, which are round in shape, such
as wheels of a vehicle, bangles, dials of many clocks, coins of denominations 50 p,
Re 1 and Rs 5, key rings, buttons of shirts, etc. (see Fig.10.1). In a clock, you might
have observed that the second’s hand goes round the dial of the clock rapidly and its
tip moves in a round path. This path traced by the tip of the second’s hand is called a
circle.  In this chapter, you will study about circles, other related terms and some
properties of a circle.

10.2 Circles and Its Related Terms: A Review
Take a compass and fix a pencil in it. Put its pointed
leg on a point on a sheet of a paper. Open the other
leg to some distance. Keeping the pointed leg on the
same point, rotate the other leg through one revolution.
What is the closed figure traced by the pencil on
paper? As you know, it is a circle (see Fig.10.2). How
did you get a circle? You kept one point fixed (A in
Fig.10.2) and drew all the points that were at a fixed
distance from A. This gives us the following definition:
The collection of all the points in a plane,
which are at a fixed distance from a fixed point in
the plane, is called a circle.
The fixed point is called the centre of the circle
and the fixed distance is called the radius of the
circle. In Fig.10.3, O is the centre and the length OP
is the radius of the circle.
Remark : Note that the line segment joining the
centre and any point on the circle is also called a
radius of the circle. That is, ‘radius’ is used in two
senses-in the sense of a line segment and also in the
sense of its length.
You are already familiar with some of the
following concepts from Class VI. We are just
recalling them.
A circle divides the plane on which it lies into
three parts. They are: (i) inside the circle, which is
also called the interior of the circle; (ii) the circle
and (iii) outside the circle, which is also called the
exterior of the circle (see Fig.10.4). The circle and
its interior make up the circular region.
If you take two points P and Q on a circle, then the line segment PQ is called a
chord of the circle (see Fig. 10.5). The chord, which passes through the centre of the
circle, is called a diameter of the circle. As in the case of radius, the word ‘diameter’
is also used in two senses, that is, as a line segment and also as its length. Do you find
any other chord of the circle longer than a diameter? No, you see that a diameter is
the longest chord and all diameters have the same length, which is equal to two

times the radius. In Fig.10.5, AOB is a diameter of
the circle. How many diameters does a circle have?
Draw a circle and see how many diameters you can
find.
A piece of a circle between two points is called
an arc. Look at the pieces of the circle between two
points P and Q in Fig.10.6. You find that there are
two pieces, one longer and the other smaller
(see Fig.10.7). The longer one is called the major
arc PQ and the shorter one is called the minor arc
PQ. The minor arc PQ is also denoted by
 PQ  and
the major arc PQ by
PRQ, where R is some point on
the arc between P and Q. Unless otherwise stated,
arc PQ or
PQ  stands for minor arc PQ. When P and
Q are ends of a diameter, then both arcs are equal
and each is called a semicircle.
The length of the complete circle is called its
circumference. The region between a chord and
either of its arcs is called a segment of the circular
region or simply a segment of the circle. You will find
that there are two types of segments also, which are
the major segment and the minor segment
(see Fig. 10.8). The region between an arc and the
two radii, joining the centre to the end points of the
arc is called a sector. Like segments, you find that
the minor arc corresponds to the minor sector and the major arc corresponds to the
major sector. In Fig. 10.9, the region OPQ is the minor sector and remaining part of
the circular region is the major sector. When two arcs are equal, that is, each is a
semicircle, then both segments and both sectors become the same and each is known
as a semicircular region.

Let us examine the relationship between the size of the chord and the angle
subtended by it at the centre. You may see by drawing different chords of a circle and
MATHEMATICS

angles subtended by them at the centre that the longer
is the chord, the bigger will be the angle subtended
by it at the centre. What will happen if you take two
equal chords of a circle? Will the angles subtended at
the centre be the same or not?
Draw two or more equal chords of a circle and
measure the angles subtended by them at the centre
(see Fig.10.12). You will find that the angles subtended
by them at the centre are equal. Let us give a proof
of this fact.
Theorem 10.1 : Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.
Proof : You are given two equal chords AB and CD
of a circle with centre O (see Fig.10.13). You want
to prove that
✁ AOB =
✁ COD.
In triangles AOB and COD,
OA = OC
(Radii of a circle)
OB = OD
(Radii of a circle)
AB = CD
(Given)
Therefore,
(SSS rule)
This gives
✁AOB =
(Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)
 Remark : For convenience, the abbreviation CPCT will be used in place of
‘Corresponding parts of congruent triangles’, because we use this very frequently as
you will see.
Now if two chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre, what can you
say about the chords? Are they equal or not? Let us examine this by the following
activity:
Take a tracing paper and trace a circle on it. Cut
it along the circle to get a disc. At its centre O, draw
an angle AOB where A, B are points on the circle.
Make another angle POQ at the centre equal to
✁AOB. Cut the disc along AB and PQ
(see Fig. 10.14). You will get two segments ACB
and PRQ of the circle. If you put one on the other,
what do you observe? They cover each other, i.e.,
they are congruent. So AB  = PQ.

Though you have seen it for this particular case, try it out for other equal angles
too. The chords will all turn out to be equal because of the following theorem:
Theorem 10.2 : If the angles subtended by the chords of a circle at the centre
are equal, then the chords are equal.
The above theorem is the converse of the Theorem 10.1. Note that in Fig. 10.13,
if you take
✁ AOB =
✁ COD, then
✥ AOB
✥ COD (Why?)
Can you now see that AB = CD?
EXERCISE 10.2
Recall that two circles are congruent if they have the same radii. Prove that equal
chords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres.
Prove that if chords of congruent circles subtend equal angles at their centres, then
the chords are equal.
10.4 Perpendicular from the Centre to a Chord
Activity : Draw a circle on a tracing paper. Let O
be its centre. Draw a chord AB. Fold the paper along
a line through O so that a portion of the chord falls on
the other. Let the crease cut AB at the point M. Then,
✁OMA =
✁OMB = 90° or OM is perpendicular to
AB. Does the point B coincide with A (see Fig.10.15)?
Yes it will. So MA = MB.
Give a proof yourself by joining OA and OB and proving the right triangles OMA
and OMB to be congruent. This example is a particular instance of the following
result:
Theorem 10.3 : The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects
the chord.
What is the converse of this theorem? To write this, first let us be clear what is
assumed in Theorem 10.3 and what is proved. Given that the perpendicular from the
centre of a circle to a chord is drawn and to prove that it bisects the chord. Thus in the
converse, what the hypothesis is ‘if a line from the centre bisects a chord of a
circle’ and what is to be proved is ‘the line is perpendicular to the chord’. So the
converse is:
Fig. 10.15
MATHEMATICS

Theorem 10.4 : The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is
perpendicular to the chord.
Is this true? Try it for few cases and see. You will
see that it is true for these cases. See if it is true, in
general, by doing the following exercise. We will write
the stages and you give the reasons.
Let AB be a chord of a circle with centre O and
O is joined to the mid-point M of AB. You have to
prove that OM
☎ AB. Join OA and OB
(see Fig. 10.16). In triangles OAM and OBM,
OA = OB
(Why ?)
AM = BM
(Why ?)
OM = OM
(Common)
Therefore,
(How ?)
This gives
✁OMA =
✁OMB = 90°    (Why ?)
10.5 Circle through Three Points
You have learnt in Chapter 6, that two points are sufficient to determine a line. That is,
there is one and only one line passing through two points. A natural question arises.
How many points are sufficient to determine a circle?
Take a point P. How many circles can be drawn through this point? You see that
there may be as many circles as you like passing through this point [see Fig. 10.17(i)].
Now take two points P and Q. You again see that there may be an infinite number of
circles passing through P and Q [see Fig.10.17(ii)]. What will happen when you take
three points A, B and C? Can you draw a circle passing through three collinear points?
Fig. 10. 17
Fig. 10.16
CIRCLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-10\Chap-10 (03-01-2006) PM65
No. If the points lie on a line, then the third point will
lie inside or outside the circle passing through two
points (see Fig 10.18).
So, let us take three points A, B and C, which are not on the same line, or in other
words, they are not collinear [see Fig. 10.19(i)]. Draw perpendicular bisectors of AB
and BC say, PQ and RS respectively. Let these perpendicular bisectors intersect at
one point O. (Note that PQ and RS will intersect because they are not parallel) [see
Fig. 10.19(ii)].
Fig. 10.19
Now O lies on the perpendicular bisector PQ of AB, you have OA = OB, as every
point on the perpendicular bisector of a line segment is equidistant from its end points,
proved in Chapter 7.
Similarly, as O lies on the perpendicular bisector RS of BC, you get
OB = OC
So OA = OB = OC, which means that the points A, B and C are at equal distances
from the point O. So if you draw a circle with centre O and radius OA, it will also pass
through B and C. This shows that there is a circle passing through the three points A,
B and C. You know that two lines (perpendicular bisectors) can intersect at only one
point, so you can draw only one circle with radius OA. In other words, there is a
unique circle passing through A, B and C. You have now proved the following theorem:
Theorem 10.5 : There is one and only one circle passing through three given
non-collinear points.
Fig. 10.18
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-10\Chap-10 (03-01-2006) PM65
Remark : If ABC is a triangle, then by Theorem 10.5, there is a unique circle passing
through the three vertices A, B and C of the triangle. This circle is called the
circumcircle of the
✂ ABC. Its centre and radius are called respectively the
circumcentre and the circumradius of the triangle.
Example 1 : Given an arc of a circle, complete the circle.
Solution : Let arc PQ of a circle be given. We have
to complete the circle, which means that we have to
find its centre and radius. Take a point R on the arc.
Join PR and RQ. Use the construction that has been
used in proving Theorem 10.5,  to find the centre and
radius.
Taking the centre and the radius so obtained, we
can complete the circle (see Fig. 10.20).
EXERCISE 10.3
Draw different pairs of circles. How many points does each pair have in common?
What is the maximum number of common points?
Suppose you are given a circle. Give a construction to find its centre.
If two circles intersect at two points, prove that their centres lie on the perpendicular
bisector of the common chord.
10.6 Equal Chords and Their Distances from the Centre
Let AB be a line and P be a point. Since there are
infinite numbers of points on a line, if you join these
points to P, you will get infinitely many line segments
PL1, PL2, PM, PL3, PL4, etc. Which of these is the
distance of AB from P? You may think a while and
get the answer. Out of these line segments, the
perpendicular from P to AB, namely PM in Fig. 10.21,
will be the least. In Mathematics, we define this least
length PM to be the distance of AB from P. So you
may say that:
The length of the perpendicular from a point to a line is the distance of the
line from the point.
Note that if the point lies on the line, the distance of the line from the point is zero.

A circle can have infinitely many chords. You may observe by drawing chords of
a circle that longer chord is nearer to the centre than the smaller chord. You may
observe it by drawing several chords of a circle of different lengths and measuring
their distances from the centre.  What is the distance of the diameter, which is the
longest chord from the centre? Since the centre lies on it, the distance is zero. Do you
think that there is some relationship between the length of chords and their distances
from the centre? Let us see if this is so.
Fig. 10.22
Activity : Draw a circle of any radius on a tracing paper. Draw two equal chords AB
and CD of it and also the perpendiculars OM and ON on them from the centre O. Fold
the figure so that D falls on B and C falls on A [see Fig.10.22 (i)]. You may observe
that O lies on the crease and N falls on M. Therefore, OM = ON. Repeat the activity
by drawing congruent circles with centres O and O
✆ and taking equal chords AB and
CD one on each. Draw perpendiculars OM and O
✆N on them [see Fig. 10.22(ii)]. Cut
one circular disc and put it on the other so that AB coincides with CD. Then you will
find that O coincides with O
✆ and M coincides with N. In this way you verified the
following:
Theorem 10.6 : Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant
from the centre (or centres).
Next, it will be seen whether the converse of this theorem is true or not. For this,
draw a circle with centre O. From the centre O, draw two line segments OL and OM
of equal length and lying inside the circle [see Fig. 10.23(i)]. Then draw chords PQ
and RS of the circle perpendicular to OL and OM respectively [see Fig 10.23(ii)].
Measure the lengths of PQ and RS. Are these different? No, both are equal. Repeat
the activity for more equal line segments and drawing the chords perpendicular to

them. This verifies the converse of the Theorem 10.6 which is stated as follows:
Theorem 10.7 : Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal in
length.
We now take an example to illustrate the use of the above results:
Example 2 : If two intersecting chords of a circle make equal angles with the diameter
passing through their point of intersection, prove that the chords are equal.
Solution : Given that AB and CD are two chords of
a circle, with centre O intersecting at a point E. PQ
is a diameter through E, such that
✁ AEQ =
✁ DEQ
(see Fig.10.24). You have to prove that AB = CD.
Draw perpendiculars OL and OM on chords AB and
CD respectively. Now
✁LOE = 180° – 90° –
✁LEO = 90° –
(Angle sum property of a triangle)
= 90° –
✁AEQ = 90° –
= 90° –
✁MEO = ✁MOE
In triangles OLE and OME,
✁LEO =
(Why ?)
✁LOE =
(Proved above)
EO = EO
(Common)
Therefore,
(Why ?)
This gives
OL = OM

AB = CD

If two equal chords of a circle intersect within the circle, prove that the line

the distance between Reshma and Mandip?

David are sitting at equal distance on its boundary each having a toy telephone in

10.7 Angle Subtended by an Arc of a Circle
You have seen that the end points of a chord other than diameter of a circle cuts it into
two arcs – one major and other minor. If you take two equal chords, what can you say
about the size of arcs? Is one arc made by first chord equal to the corresponding arc
made by another chord? In fact, they are more than just equal in length. They are
congruent in the sense that if one arc is put on the other, without bending or twisting,
one superimposes the other completely.
You can verify this fact by cutting the arc,
corresponding to the chord CD from the circle along
CD and put it on the corresponding arc made by equal
chord AB. You will find that the arc CD superimpose
the arc AB completely  (see Fig. 10.26). This shows
that equal chords make congruent arcs and
conversely congruent arcs make equal chords of a
circle. You can state it as follows:
If two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs are congruent
and conversely, if two arcs are congruent, then their corresponding chords are
equal.
Fig. 10.25
Fig. 10.26
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-10\Chap-10 (03-01-2006) PM65
Also the angle subtended by an arc at the centre
is defined to be angle subtended by the corresponding
chord at the centre in the sense that the minor arc
subtends the angle and the major arc subtends the
reflex angle. Therefore, in Fig 10.27, the angle
subtended by the minor arc PQ at O is
✁POQ and
the angle subtended by the major arc PQ at O is
reflex angle POQ.
In view of the property above and Theorem 10.1,
the following result is true:
Congruent arcs (or equal arcs) of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.
Therefore, the angle subtended by a chord of a circle at its centre is equal to the
angle subtended by the corresponding (minor) arc at the centre. The following theorem
gives the relationship between the angles subtended by an arc at the centre and at a
point on the circle.
Theorem 10.8 : The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle
subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.
Proof : Given an arc PQ of a circle subtending angles POQ at the centre O and
PAQ at a point A on the remaining part of the circle. We need to prove that
✁POQ = 2
✁PAQ.
Fig. 10.28
Consider the three different cases as given in Fig. 10.28. In (i), arc PQ is minor; in (ii),
arc PQ is a semicircle and in (iii), arc PQ is major.
Let us begin by joining AO and extending it to a point B.
In all the cases,
✁BOQ =
✁OAQ +
because an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite
angles.
Fig. 10.27
CIRCLES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-10\Chap-10 (03-01-2006) PM65
Also in
✂OAQ,
OA = OQ
(Radii of a circle)
Therefore,
✁OAQ =
(Theorem 7.5)
This gives
✁BOQ = 2
Similarly,
✁BOP = 2
From (1) and (2),
✁BOP +
✁BOQ = 2(
✁OAP +
✁OAQ)
This is the same as
✁POQ = 2
For the case (iii), where PQ is the major arc, (3) is replaced by
reflex angle POQ = 2
 Remark : Suppose we join points P and Q and
form a chord PQ in the above figures. Then
✁ PAQ is also called the angle formed in the
segment PAQP.
In Theorem 10.8, A can be any point on the
remaining part of the circle. So if you take any
other point C on the remaining part of the circle
(see Fig. 10.29), you have
✁POQ = 2
✁PCQ = 2
Therefore,
✁PCQ =
✁PAQ.
This proves the following:
Theorem 10.9 : Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.
Again let us discuss the case (ii) of Theorem 10.8 separately. Here
✁PAQ is an angle
in the segment, which is a semicircle. Also,
✁PAQ = 1
✁ POQ = 1
2  × 180° = 90°.
If you take any other point C on the semicircle, again you get that
✁PCQ = 90°
Therefore, you find another property of the circle as:
Angle in a semicircle is a right angle.
The converse of Theorem 10.9 is also true. It can be stated as:
Theorem 10.10 : If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at
two other points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment,
the four points lie on a circle (i.e. they are concyclic).
Fig. 10.29
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-10\Chap-10 (03-01-2006) PM65
You can see the truth of this result as follows:
In Fig. 10.30, AB is a line segment, which subtends equal angles at two points C and
D. That is
✁ACB =
To show that the points A, B, C and D lie on a circle
let us draw a circle through the points A, C and B.
Suppose it does not pass through the point D. Then it
will intersect AD (or extended AD) at a point, say E
(or E
If points A, C, E and B lie on a circle,
✁ACB =

But it is given that
✁ACB =
✁ADB.
Therefore,
✁AEB =
✁ADB.
This is not possible unless E coincides with D. (Why?)
Similarly, E
✆ should also coincide with D.
10.8 Cyclic Quadrilaterals
A quadrilateral ABCD is called cyclic if all the four vertices
of it lie on a circle (see Fig 10.31). You will find a peculiar
property in such quadrilaterals. Draw several cyclic
quadrilaterals of different sides and name each of these
as ABCD. (This can be done by drawing several circles
of different radii and taking four points on each of them.)
Measure the opposite angles and write your observations
in the following table.

You find that
✁C = 180° and
✁D = 180°, neglecting the error in
measurements. This verifies the following:
Theorem 10.11 : The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic
quadrilateral is 180º.
In fact, the converse of this theorem, which is stated below is also true.
Theorem 10.12 : If the sum of a pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is
180º, the quadrilateral is cyclic.
You can see the truth of this theorem by following a method similar to the method
adopted for Theorem 10.10.
Example 3 : In Fig. 10.32, AB is a diameter of the circle, CD is a chord equal to the
radius of the circle. AC and BD when extended intersect at a point E. Prove that
✁AEB = 60°.
Solution : Join OC, OD and BC.
Triangle ODC is equilateral
(Why?)
Therefore,
✁COD = 60°
✁CBD  = 1
(Theorem 10.8)
This gives
✁CBD = 30°
Again,
✁ACB = 90°
(Why ?)
✁BCE = 180° – ✁ACB = 90°
Which gives
✁CEB = 90° – 30° = 60°, i.e. ✁AEB = 60°
Example 4 : In Fig 10.33, ABCD is a cyclic
quadrilateral in which AC and BD are its diagonals.
If ✁ DBC = 55° and ✁ BAC = 45°, find
✁ BCD.
Solution :
✁CAD = ✁DBC = 55°
(Angles in the same segment)
Therefore,
✁ DAB =
✁ CAD +
✁ BAC
= 55° + 45° = 100°
✁ DAB +
✁ BCD = 180°
(Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral)
✁ BCD = 180° – 100° = 80°

Example 5 : Two circles intersect at two points A
and B. AD and AC are diameters to the two circles
(see Fig.10.34). Prove that B lies on the line segment
Solution : Join AB.
✁ABD = 90° (Angle in a semicircle)
✁ABC = 90° (Angle in a semicircle)
✁ABD + ✁ABC = 90° + 90° = 180°
Therefore, DBC is a line. That is B lies on the line segment DC.
Example 6 : Prove that the quadrilateral formed (if possible) by the internal angle
bisectors of any quadrilateral is cyclic.
Solution : In Fig. 10.35, ABCD is a quadrilateral in
which the angle bisectors AH, BF, CF and DH of
internal angles A, B, C and D respectively form a
quadrilateral EFGH.
Now, ✁FEH = ✁AEB = 180° –
✁EAB –
✁EBA (Why ?)
= 180° – 1
2  (✁A + ✁B)
✁FGH = ✁CGD = 180° – ✁GCD – ✁GDC (Why ?)
= 180° – 1
Therefore,
✁FEH + ✁FGH = 180° – 1
✁A + ✁B) + 180° – 1
✁C + ✁D)
= 360° – 1
✁D) = 360° – 1
2  × 360°
= 360° – 180° = 180°
Therefore, by Theorem 10.12, the quadrilateral EFGH is cyclic.

10.9 Summary
In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
A circle is the collection of all points in a plane, which are equidistant from a fixed point in
the plane.
Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) subtend equal angles at the centre.
If the angles subtended by two chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) at the centre
(corresponding centres) are equal, the chords are equal.
The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.
The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the
chord.
There is one and only one circle passing through three non-collinear points.
Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant from the centre (or
corresponding centres).
Chords equidistant from the centre (or corresponding centres) of a circle (or of congruent
circles) are equal.
If two arcs of a circle are congruent, then their corresponding chords are equal and
conversely if two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs (minor, major)
are congruent.
10. Congruent arcs of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.
The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it at any
point on the remaining part of the circle.
12. Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.
13. Angle in a semicircle is a right angle.
14. If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at two other points lying on
the same side of the line containing the line segment, the four points lie on a circle.
15. The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 1800.
16. If sum of a pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is 1800, the quadrilateral is cyclic.

11.1 Introduction
In earlier chapters, the diagrams, which were necessary to prove a theorem or solving
exercises were not necessarily precise. They were drawn only to give you a feeling for
the situation and as an aid for proper reasoning. However, sometimes one needs an
accurate figure, for example - to draw a map of a building to be constructed, to design
tools, and various parts of a machine, to draw road maps etc. To draw such figures
some basic geometrical instruments are needed. You must be having a geometry box
which contains the following:
A graduated scale, on one side of which centimetres and millimetres are
marked off and on the other side inches and their parts are marked off.
A pair of set - squares, one with angles 90°, 60° and 30° and other with angles
90°, 45° and 45°.
(iii) A pair of dividers (or a divider) with adjustments.
(iv) A pair of compasses (or a compass) with provision of fitting a pencil at one
A protractor.
Normally, all these instruments are needed in drawing a geometrical figure, such
as a triangle, a circle, a quadrilateral, a polygon, etc. with given measurements. But a
geometrical construction is the process of drawing a geometrical figure using only two
instruments – an ungraduated ruler, also called a straight edge and a compass. In
construction where measurements are also required, you may use a graduated scale
and protractor also. In this chapter, some basic constructions will be considered. These
will then be used to construct certain kinds of triangles.

11.2 Basic Constructions
In Class VI, you have learnt how to construct a circle, the perpendicular bisector of a
line segment, angles of 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° and 120°, and the bisector of a given angle,
without giving any justification for these constructions. In this section, you will construct
some of these, with reasoning behind, why these constructions are valid.
Construction 11.1 : To construct the bisector of a given angle.
Given an angle ABC, we want to construct its bisector.
Steps of Construction :
1. Taking B as centre and any radius, draw an arc to intersect the rays BA and BC,
say at E and D respectively [see Fig.11.1(i)].
2. Next, taking D and E as centres and with the radius more than 1
2  DE, draw arcs to
intersect each other, say at F.
3. Draw the ray BF [see Fig.11.1(ii)]. This ray BF is the required bisector of the angle
Fig. 11.1
Let us see how this method gives us the required angle bisector.
Join DF and EF.
In triangles BEF and BDF,
BE = BD (Radii of the same arc)
EF = DF
(Arcs of equal radii)
BF = BF
(Common)
Therefore,
(SSS rule)
This gives

Construction 11.2 : To construct the perpendicular bisector of a given line
segment.
Given a line segment AB, we want to construct its perpendicular bisector.
Steps of Construction :
1. Taking A and B as centres and radius more than
2  AB, draw arcs on both sides of the line segment
AB (to intersect each other).
2. Let these arcs intersect each other at P and Q.
Join PQ (see Fig.11.2).
3. Let PQ intersect AB at the point M. Then line
PMQ is the required perpendicular bisector of AB.
Let us see how this method gives us the
perpendicular bisector of AB.
Join A and B to both P and Q to form AP, AQ, BP
and BQ.
In triangles PAQ and PBQ,
AP = BP
(Arcs of equal radii)
AQ = BQ
(Arcs of equal radii)
PQ = PQ
(Common)
Therefore,
✁ PBQ
(SSS rule)
✄APM =
(CPCT)
Now in triangles PMA and PMB,
AP = BP
(As before)
PM = PM
(Common)
✄APM =
(Proved above)
Therefore,
✁ PMB
(SAS rule)
AM = BM and
✄PMA =
(CPCT)
✄PMA +
✄PMB = 180°
(Linear pair axiom),
we get
✄PMA =
✄PMB = 90°.
Therefore, PM, that is, PMQ is the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Construction 11.3 : To construct an angle of 600 at the initial point of a given
Let us take a ray AB with initial point A [see Fig. 11.3(i)]. We want to construct a ray
AC such that
✄ CAB = 60°. One way of doing so is given below.
Steps of Construction :
1. Taking A as centre and some radius, draw an arc
of a circle, which intersects AB, say at a point D.
2. Taking D as centre and with the same radius as
before, draw an arc intersecting the previously
drawn arc, say at a point E.
3. Draw the ray AC passing through E [see Fig 11.3 (ii)].
✄CAB is the required angle of 60°. Now,
let us see how this method gives us the required
angle of 60°.
Join DE.
Then,
AE = AD = DE
(By construction)
Therefore,
✁ EAD is an equilateral  triangle  and the
✄EAD,  which is the same as
✄CAB is equal to 60°.

(iii) 15°

(iii) 135°
Construct an equilateral triangle, given its side and justify the construction.
11.3 Some Constructions of Triangles
So far, some basic constructions have been considered. Next, some constructions of
triangles will be done by using the constructions given in earlier classes and given
above. Recall from the Chapter 7 that SAS, SSS, ASA and RHS rules give the
congruency of two triangles. Therefore, a triangle is unique if : (i) two sides and the
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-11\Chap-11 (03-01-2006) PM65
included angle is given, (ii) three sides are given, (iii) two angles and the included side
is given and, (iv) in a right triangle, hypotenuse and one side is given. You have already
learnt how to construct such triangles in Class VII. Now, let us consider some more
constructions of triangles. You may have noted that at least three parts of a triangle
have to be given for constructing it but not all combinations of three parts are sufficient
for the purpose. For example, if two sides and an angle (not the included angle) are
given, then it is not always possible to construct such a triangle uniquely.
Construction 11.4 : To construct a triangle, given its base, a base angle and sum
of other two sides.
Given the base BC, a base angle, say
✄B and the sum AB + AC of the other two sides
of a triangle ABC, you are required to construct it.
Steps of Construction :
1. Draw the base BC and at the point B make an
angle, say XBC equal to the given angle.
2. Cut a line segment BD equal to AB + AC from
the ray BX.
3. Join DC and make an angle DCY equal to
✄BDC.
4. Let CY intersect BX at A (see Fig. 11.4).
Then, ABC is the required triangle.
Let us see how you get the required triangle.
Base BC and
✄B are drawn as given. Next in triangle
✄ACD =
✄ ADC
(By construction)
Therefore, AC = AD and then
AB = BD – AD = BD – AC
AB + AC = BD
Alternative method :
Follow the first two steps as above. Then draw
perpendicular bisector PQ of CD to intersect BD at
a point A (see Fig 11.5). Join AC. Then ABC is the
required triangle. Note that A lies on the perpendicular
bisector of CD, therefore AD = AC.
Remark : The construction of the triangle is not
possible if the sum AB +  AC
☎ BC.

Construction 11.5 : To construct a triangle given its base, a base angle and the
difference of the other two sides.
Given the base BC, a base angle, say
✄B and the difference of other two sides
AB – AC or AC – AB, you have to construct the triangle ABC. Clearly there are
following two cases:
Case (i) : Let AB > AC that is AB – AC is given.
Steps of Construction :
1. Draw the base BC and at point B make an angle
say XBC equal to the given angle.
2. Cut the line segment BD equal to AB – AC from
ray BX.
3. Join DC and draw the perpendicular bisector, say
PQ of DC.
4. Let it intersect BX at a point A. Join AC
(see Fig. 11.6).
Then ABC is the required triangle.
Let us now see how you have obtained the required triangle ABC.
Base BC and
✄B are drawn as given. The point A lies on the perpendicular bisector of
DC. Therefore,
AD = AC
BD = AB – AD = AB – AC.
Case (ii) : Let AB < AC that is AC – AB is given.
Steps of Construction :
1. Same as in case (i).
2. Cut line segment BD equal to AC – AB from the
line BX extended on opposite side of line segment
3. Join DC and draw the perpendicular bisector, say
PQ of DC.
4. Let PQ intersect BX at A. Join AC (see Fig. 11.7).
Then, ABC is the required triangle.
You can justify the construction as in case (i).

Construction 11.6 : To construct a triangle, given its perimeter and its two base
angles.
Given the base angles, say
✥B and
✥C and BC + CA + AB, you have to construct
the triangle ABC.

1. Draw a line segment, say XY equal to BC + CA + AB.
2. Make angles LXY equal to
✥B and MYX equal to
3. Bisect
✥LXY and
✥MYX. Let these bisectors intersect at a point A
[see Fig. 11.8(i)].
Fig. 11.8 (i)
4. Draw perpendicular bisectors PQ of AX and RS of AY.
5. Let PQ intersect XY at B and RS intersect XY at C. Join AB and AC
[see Fig 11.8(ii)].
Fig. 11.8 (ii)
Then ABC is the required triangle. For the justification of the construction, you
observe that, B lies on the perpendicular bisector PQ of AX.
Therefore, XB = AB and similarly, CY = AC.
This gives
BC + CA + AB = BC + XB + CY = XY.
Again
✥BAX =
✥AXB (As in
✁ AXB, AB = XB) and
✥ABC =
✥BAX +
✥AXB = 2

HERON’S FORMULA
12.1 Introduction
You have studied in earlier classes about figures of different shapes such as squares,
rectangles, triangles  and quadrilaterals. You have also calculated perimeters and the
areas of some of these figures like rectangle, square etc. For instance, you can find
the area and the perimeter of the floor of your classroom.
Let us take a walk around the floor along its sides once; the distance we walk is its
perimeter. The size of the floor of the room is its area.
So, if your classroom is rectangular with length 10 m and width 8 m, its perimeter
would be 2(10 m + 8 m) = 36 m and its area would be 10 m × 8 m, i.e., 80 m2.
Unit of measurement for length or breadth is taken as metre (m) or centimetre
(cm) etc.
Unit of measurement for area of any plane figure is taken as square metre (m2) or
square centimetre (cm2) etc.
Suppose that you are sitting in a triangular garden. How would you find its area?
From Chapter 9 and from your earlier classes, you know that:
Area of a triangle = 1
2  × base × height
We see that when the triangle is right angled,
we can directly apply the formula by using two sides
containing the right angle as base and height. For
example, suppose that the sides of a right triangle
ABC are 5 cm, 12 cm and 13 cm; we take base as
12 cm and height as 5 cm (see Fig. 12.1). Then the
Fig. 12.1
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-12\Chap-12 (03-01-2006) PM65
area of ✁ABC is given by
2  × base × height = 1
2  × 12 × 5 cm2, i.e., 30 cm2
Note that we could also take 5 cm as the base and 12 cm as height.
Now suppose we want to find the area of an equilateral triangle PQR with side
10cm (see Fig. 12.2). To find its area we need its height. Can you find the height of
this triangle?
Let us recall how we find its height when we
know its sides. This is possible in an equilateral
triangle. Take the mid-point of QR as M and join it to
P. We know that PMQ is a right triangle. Therefore,
by using Pythagoras Theorem, we can find the length
PM as shown below:
PQ2 = PM2 + QM2
i.e.,
(10)2 = PM2 + (5)2, since QM = MR.
Therefore, we have PM2 = 75
i.e.,
75  cm = 5 3  cm.
Then area of
✁PQR = 1
2  × base × height =
5 3 cm
Let us see now whether we can calculate the area of an isosceles triangle also
with the help of this formula. For example, we take a triangle XYZ with two equal
sides XY and XZ as 5 cm each and unequal side YZ as 8 cm (see Fig. 12.3).
In this case also, we want to know the height of the triangle. So, from X we draw
a perpendicular XP to side YZ. You can see that this perpendicular XP divides the
base YZ of the triangle in two equal parts.
Therefore,
YP = PZ = 1
2  YZ = 4 cm
Then, by using Pythagoras theorem, we get
XP2 = XY2 – YP2
= 52 – 42 = 25 – 16 = 9
XP = 3 cm
Now, area of ✁XYZ = 1
2  × base YZ × height XP
2  × 8 × 3 cm2 = 12 cm2.

Now suppose that we know the lengths of the sides of a scalene triangle and not
the height. Can you still find its area? For instance, you have a triangular park whose
sides are 40 m, 32 m, and 24 m. How will you calculate its area? Definitely if you want
to apply the formula, you will have to calculate its height. But we do not have a clue to
calculate the height. Try doing so. If you are not able to get it, then go to the next
section.
12.2 Area of a Triangle — by Heron’s Formula
Heron was born in about 10AD possibly in Alexandria in
Egypt. He worked in applied mathematics. His works on
mathematical and physical subjects are so numerous and
varied that he is considered to be an encyclopedic writer
in these fields. His geometrical works deal largely with
problems on mensuration written in three books. Book I
deals with the area of squares, rectangles, triangles,
trapezoids (trapezia), various other specialised
quadrilaterals, the regular polygons, circles, surfaces of
cylinders, cones, spheres etc. In this book, Heron has
derived the famous formula for the area of a triangle in
terms of its three sides.
The formula given by Heron about the area of a triangle, is also known as Hero’s
formula. It is stated as:
Area of a triangle =
   (II)
where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle, and s = semi-perimeter i.e. half the
perimeter of the triangle =
This formula is helpful where it is not possible to find the height of the triangle
easily. Let us apply it to calculate the area of the triangular park ABC, mentioned
above (see Fig. 12.5).
Let us take a = 40 m, b = 24 m, c = 32 m,
so that we have s = 40
m = 48 m.
Fig. 12.4
Heron (10AD – 75 AD)
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-12\Chap-12 (03-01-2006) PM65
s – a = (48 – 40) m = 8 m,
s – b = (48 – 24) m = 24 m,
s – c = (48 – 32) m = 16 m.
Therefore, area of the park ABC
   s s
We see that 322 + 242 = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 402. Therefore, the sides of the park
make a right triangle. The largest side i.e. BC which is 40 m will be the hypotenuse
and the angle between the sides AB and AC will be 90°.
By using Formula I, we can check that the area of the park is 1
2  × 32 × 24 m2
= 384 m2.
We find that the area we have got is the same as we found by using Heron’s
formula.
Now using Heron’s formula, you verify this fact by finding the areas of other
triangles discussed earlier viz;
(i) equilateral triangle with side 10 cm.
(ii) isosceles triangle with unequal side as 8 cm and each equal side as 5 cm.
You will see that
For (i), we have s = 10
cm = 15 cm.
Area of triangle  = 15(15
10) (15
10) (15
25 3 cm
For (ii), we have s = 8
Area of triangle =

12 cm .
Let us now solve some more examples:
Fig. 12.5
HERON’S FORMULA
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-12\Chap-12 (03-01-2006) PM65
Example 1 : Find the area of a triangle, two sides of which are 8 cm and 11 cm and
the perimeter is 32 cm (see Fig. 12.6).
Solution : Here we have perimeter of the triangle = 32 cm, a = 8 cm and b = 11 cm.
Third side c = 32 cm – (8 + 11) cm = 13 cm
2s = 32
i.e. s = 16 cm,
s – a = (16 – 8) cm = 8 cm,
s – b = (16 – 11) cm = 5 cm,
s – c = (16 – 13) cm = 3 cm.
Therefore, area of the triangle =
8 30 cm
Example 2 : A triangular park ABC has sides 120m, 80m and 50m (see Fig. 12.7). A
gardener Dhania has to put a fence all around it and also plant grass inside. How
much area does she need to plant? Find the cost of fencing it with barbed wire at the
rate of Rs 20 per metre leaving a space 3m wide for a gate on one side.
Solution : For finding area of the park, we have
2s = 50 m + 80 m + 120 m = 250 m.
i.e.,
s = 125 m
s – a = (125 – 120) m = 5 m,
s – b = (125 – 80) m = 45 m,
s – c = (125 – 50) m = 75 m.
Therefore, area of the park =
375 15 m
Also, perimeter of the park =  AB + BC + CA = 250 m
Therefore, length of the wire needed for fencing = 250 m – 3 m (to be left for gate)
= 247 m
And so the cost of fencing = Rs 20 × 247 = Rs 4940

Example 3 : The sides of a triangular plot are in the ratio of 3 : 5 : 7 and its perimeter
is 300 m. Find its area.
Solution : Suppose that the sides, in metres, are 3x, 5x and 7x (see Fig. 12.8).
Then, we know that 3x + 5x + 7x = 300 (perimeter of the triangle)
Therefore, 15x = 300, which gives x = 20.
So the sides of the triangle are 3 × 20 m, 5 × 20 m and 7 × 20 m
i.e.,
60 m, 100 m and 140 m.
Can you now find the area [Using Heron’s formula]?

12.3 Application of Heron’s Formula in Finding Areas of Quadrilaterals
Suppose that a farmer has a land to be cultivated and she employs some labourers for
this purpose on the terms of wages calculated by area cultivated per square metre.
How will she do this? Many a time, the fields are in the shape of quadrilaterals. We
need to divide the quadrilateral in triangular parts and then use the formula for area of
the triangle. Let us look at this problem:
Example 4 : Kamla has a triangular field with sides 240 m, 200 m, 360 m, where she
grew wheat. In another triangular field with sides 240 m, 320 m, 400 m adjacent to the
previous field, she wanted to grow potatoes and onions (see Fig. 12.11). She divided
the field in two parts by joining the mid-point of the longest side to the opposite vertex
and grew patatoes in one part and onions in the other part. How much area (in hectares)
has been used for wheat, potatoes and onions? (1 hectare = 10000 m2)
Solution : Let ABC be the field where wheat is grown. Also let ACD be the field
which has been divided in two parts by joining C to the mid-point E of AD. For the
area of triangle ABC, we have
a = 200 m, b = 240 m, c = 360 m
Therefore, s = 200
   m = 400 m.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-12\Chap-12 (03-01-2006) PM65
So, area for growing wheat
400(400
200) (400 – 240) (400 – 360)
16000 2 m  = 1.6 ×
2  hectares
= 2.26 hectares (nearly)
Let us now calculate the area of triangle ACD.
Here, we have s = 240
m = 480 m.
So, area of ✄ACD =

We notice that the line segment joining the mid-point E of AD to C divides the
triangle ACD in two parts equal in area. Can you give the reason for this? In fact, they
have the bases AE and ED equal and, of course, they have the same height.
Therefore, area for growing potatoes = area for growing onions
= (3.84
÷ 2) hectares = 1.92 hectares.
Example 5 : Students of a school staged a rally for cleanliness campaign. They
walked through the lanes in two groups. One group walked through the lanes AB, BC
and CA; while the other through AC, CD and DA (see Fig. 12.12). Then they cleaned
the area enclosed within their lanes. If AB = 9 m, BC = 40 m, CD = 15 m, DA = 28 m
☎B = 90º, which group cleaned more area and by how much? Find the total area
cleaned by the students (neglecting the width of the lanes).
Solution : Since AB = 9 m and BC = 40 m,
☎B = 90°, we have:
1681  m = 41m
Therefore, the first group has to clean the area of triangle ABC, which is right angled.
Area of ✄ABC = 1
2  × base × height
2  × 40 × 9 m2 = 180 m2

The second group has to clean the area of triangle ACD, which is scalene having sides
41 m, 15 m and 28 m.
Here,

Therefore, area of

)( – )
42(42 – 41) (42 – 15)(42 – 28) m2
m2 = 126 m2
So first group cleaned 180 m2 which is (180 – 126) m2, i.e., 54 m2 more than the area
cleaned by the second group.
Total area cleaned by all the students = (180 + 126) m2 = 306 m2.
Example 6 : Sanya has a piece of land which is in the shape of a rhombus
(see Fig. 12.13). She wants her one daughter and one son to work on the land and
produce different crops. She divided the land in two equal parts. If the perimeter of
the land is 400 m and one of the diagonals is 160 m, how much area each of them will
get for their crops?
Solution : Let ABCD be the field.
Perimeter = 400 m
So, each side = 400 m
÷ 4 = 100 m.
i.e. AB = AD = 100 m.
Let diagonal    BD = 160 m.
Then semi-perimeter s of
✁ABD is given by
s = 100
   m = 180 m
Therefore, area of
✁ABD =
180(180
100) (180 – 100) (180 – 160)

Therefore, each of them will get an area of 4800 m2.

CHAPTER 13
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES
13.1 Introduction
Wherever we look, usually we see solids. So far, in all our study, we have been dealing
with figures that can be easily drawn on our notebooks or blackboards. These are
called plane figures. We have understood what rectangles, squares and circles are,
what we mean by their perimeters and areas, and how we can find them. We have
learnt these in earlier classes. It would be interesting to see what happens if we cut
out many of these plane figures of the same shape and size from cardboard sheet and
stack them up in a vertical pile. By this process, we shall obtain some solid figures
(briefly called solids) such as a cuboid, a cylinder, etc. In the earlier classes, you have
also learnt to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids, cubes and cylinders. We
shall now learn to find the surface areas and volumes of cuboids and cylinders in
details and extend this study to some other solids such as cones and spheres.
13.2 Surface Area of a Cuboid and a Cube
Have you looked at a bundle of many sheets of paper? How does it look? Does it look
like what you see in Fig. 13.1?
Fig. 13.1
That makes up a cuboid. How much of brown paper would you need, if you want
to cover this cuboid? Let us see:
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
First we would need a rectangular piece to cover
the bottom of the bundle. That would be as shown in
Fig. 13.2 (a)
Then we would need two long rectangular pieces
to cover the two side ends. Now, it would look like
Fig. 13.2 (b).
Now to cover the front and back ends, we would
need two more rectangular pieces of a different size.
With them, we would now have a figure as shown in
Fig. 13.2(c).
This figure, when opened out, would look like
Fig. 13.2 (d).
Finally, to cover the top of the bundle, we would
require another rectangular piece exactly like the one
at the bottom, which if we attach on the right side, it
would look like Fig. 13.2(e).
So we have used six rectangular pieces to cover
the complete outer surface of the cuboid.
Fig. 13.2
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
This shows us that the outer surface of a cuboid is made up of six rectangles (in
fact, rectangular regions, called the faces of the cuboid), whose areas can be found by
multiplying length by breadth for each of them separately  and then adding the six
areas together.
Now, if we take the length of the cuboid as l, breadth as b and the height as h, then
the figure with these dimensions would be like the shape you see in Fig. 13.2(f).
So, the sum of the areas of the six rectangles is:
Area of rectangle 1 (= l × h)
Area of rectangle 2 (= l × b)
Area of rectangle 3 (= l × h)
Area of rectangle 4 (= l × b)
Area of rectangle 5 (= b × h)
Area of rectangle 6 (= b × h)
= 2(l × b) + 2(b × h) + 2(l × h)
= 2(lb + bh + hl)
This gives us:
Surface Area of a Cuboid = 2(lb + bh + hl)
where l, b and h are respectively the three edges of the cuboid.
Note : The unit of area is taken as the square unit, because we measure the magnitude
of a region by filling it with squares of side of unit length.
For example, if we have a cuboid whose length, breadth and height are 15 cm,
10 cm and 20 cm respectively, then its surface area would be:
2[(15 × 10) + (10 × 20) + (20 × 15)] cm2
= 2(150 + 200 + 300) cm2
= 2 × 650 cm2
= 1300 cm2
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
Recall that a cuboid, whose length, breadth and height are all equal, is called a
cube. If each edge of the cube is a, then the surface area of this cube would be
2(a × a + a × a + a × a) i.e., 6a2 (see Fig. 13.3), giving us
Surface Area of a Cube = 6a2
where a is the edge of the cube.
Fig. 13.3
Suppose, out of the six faces of a cuboid, we only find the area of the four faces,
leaving the bottom and top faces. In such a case, the area of these four faces is called
the lateral surface area of the cuboid. So, lateral surface area of a cuboid of
length l, breadth b and height h is equal to 2lh + 2bh or 2(l + b)h. Similarly,
lateral surface area of a cube of side a is equal to 4a2.
Keeping in view of the above, the surface area of a cuboid (or a cube) is sometimes
also referred to as the total surface area. Let us now solve some examples.
Example 1 : Mary wants to decorate her Christmas
tree. She wants to place the tree on a wooden box
covered with coloured paper with picture of Santa
Claus on it (see Fig. 13.4). She must know the exact
quantity of paper to buy for this purpose. If the box
has length, breadth and height as 80 cm, 40 cm and
20 cm respectively how many square sheets of paper
of side 40 cm would she require?
Solution : Since Mary wants to paste the paper on
the outer surface of the box; the quantity of paper
required would be equal to the surface area of the
box which is of the shape of a cuboid. The dimensions
of the box are:
Fig. 13.4
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
Length =80 cm, Breadth = 40 cm, Height = 20 cm.
The surface area of the box = 2(lb + bh + hl)
= 2[(80 × 40) + (40 × 20) + (20 × 80)] cm2
= 2[3200 + 800 + 1600] cm2
= 2 × 5600 cm2 = 11200 cm2
The area of each sheet of the paper = 40 × 40 cm2
= 1600 cm2
Therefore, number of sheets required =
surface area of box
area of one sheet of paper
= 11200
1600  = 7
So, she would require 7 sheets.
Example 2 : Hameed has built a cubical water tank with lid for his house, with each
outer edge 1.5 m long. He gets the outer surface of the tank excluding the base,
covered with square tiles of side 25 cm (see Fig. 13.5). Find how much he would
spend for the tiles, if the cost of the tiles is Rs 360 per dozen.
Solution : Since Hameed is getting the five outer faces of the tank covered with tiles,
he would need to know the surface area of the tank, to decide on the number of tiles
required.
Edge of the cubical tank = 1.5 m = 150 cm (= a)
surface area of the tank = 5 × 150 × 150 cm2
Area of each square tile = side × side = 25 × 25 cm2
So, the number of tiles required = surface area of the tank
area of each tile
= 5 ×150 ×150
25 × 25
= 180
Cost of 1 dozen tiles, i.e., cost of 12 tiles = Rs 360
Therefore, cost of one tile = Rs 360
12  = Rs 30
So, the cost of 180 tiles = 180 × Rs 30 = Rs 5400

13.3 Surface Area of a Right Circular Cylinder
If we take a number of circular sheets of paper and stack them up as we stacked up
rectangular sheets earlier, what would we get (see Fig. 13.6)?
Fig. 13.6
Here, if the stack is kept vertically up, we get what is called a right circular
cylinder, since it has been kept at right angles to the base, and the base is circular. Let
us see what kind of cylinder is not a right circular cylinder.
In Fig 13.7 (a), you see a cylinder, which
is certainly circular, but it is not at right angles
to the base. So, we can not say this a right
circular cylinder.
Of course, if we have a cylinder with a
non circular base, as you see in Fig. 13.7 (b),
then we also cannot call it a right circular
cylinder.
Remark : Here, we will be dealing with only right circular cylinders. So, unless stated
otherwise, the word cylinder would mean a right circular cylinder.
Now, if a cylinder is to be covered with coloured paper, how will we do it with the
minimum amount of paper? First take a rectangular sheet of paper, whose length is
just enough to go round the cylinder and whose breadth is equal to the height of the
cylinder as shown in Fig. 13.8.
Fig. 13.7
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
Fig. 13.8
The area of the sheet gives us the curved surface area of the cylinder. Note that
the length of the sheet is equal to the circumference of the circular base which is equal
So, curved surface area of the cylinder
= area of the rectangular sheet = length × breadth
= perimeter of the base of the cylinder × h
✁r × h
Therefore, Curved Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2
where r is the radius of the base of the cylinder and h is the height of the cylinder.
Remark : In the case of a cylinder, unless stated
otherwise, ‘radius of a cylinder’ shall mean’ base radius
of the cylinder’.
If the top and the bottom of the cylinder are also to
be covered, then we need two circles (infact, circular
regions) to do that, each of radius r, and thus having an
area of
✁r2 each (see Fig. 13.9), giving us the total
surface area as 2
✁rh + 2
✁r2 = 2
✁r(r + h).
Total Surface Area of a Cylinder = 2
✁r(r + h)
where h is the height of the cylinder and r its radius.
Remark : You may recall from Chapter 1 that
✁ is an irrational number. So, the value
Fig. 13.9
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
✁ is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal. But when we use its value in our
calculations, we usually take its value as approximately equal to 22
7  or 3.14.
Example 3 : Savitri had to make a model of a cylindrical kaleidoscope for her science
project. She wanted to use chart paper to make the curved surface of the kaleidoscope.
(see Fig 13.10). What would be the area of chart paper required by her, if she wanted
to make a kaleidoscope of length 25 cm with a 3.5 cm radius? You may take
✁ = 22
Solution : Radius of the base of the cylindrical kaleidoscope (r) = 3.5 cm.
Height (length) of kaleidoscope (h) = 25 cm.
Area of chart paper required = curved surface area of the kaleidoscope
25 cm
   = 550 cm2

13.4 Surface Area of a Right Circular Cone
So far, we have been generating solids by stacking up congruent figures. Incidentally,
such figures are called prisms. Now let us look at another kind of solid which is not a
prism. (These kinds of solids are called pyramids). Let us see how we can generate
them.
Activity : Cut out a right-angled triangle ABC right angled at B. Paste a long thick
string along one of the perpendicular sides say AB of the triangle [see Fig. 13.13(a)].
Hold the string with your hands on either sides of the triangle and rotate the triangle

MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
about the string a number of times. What happens? Do you recognize the shape that
the triangle is forming as it rotates around the string [see Fig. 13.13(b)]? Does it
remind you of the time you had eaten an ice-cream heaped into a container of that
shape [see Fig. 13.13 (c) and (d)]?
Fig. 13.13
This is called a right circular cone. In Fig. 13.13(c)
of the right circular cone, the point A is called the
vertex, AB is called the height, BC is called the radius
and AC is called the slant height of the cone. Here B
will be the centre of circular base of the cone. The
height, radius and slant height of the cone are usually
denoted by h, r and l respectively. Once again, let us
see what kind of cone we can not call a right circular
cone. Here, you are (see Fig. 13.14)! What you see
in these figures are not right circular cones; because
in (a), the line joining its vertex to the centre of its
base is not at right angle to the base, and in (b) the
base is not circular.
As in the case of cylinder, since we will be studying only about right circular cones,
remember that by ‘cone’ in this chapter, we shall mean a ‘right circular cone.’
Activity : (i) Cut out a neatly made paper cone that does not have any overlapped
paper, straight along its side, and opening it out, to see the shape of paper that forms
the surface of the cone. (The line along which you cut the cone is the slant height of
the cone which is represented by l). It looks like a part of a round cake.

If you now bring the sides marked A and B at the tips together, you can see that
the curved portion of Fig. 13.15 (c) will form the circular base of the cone.
Fig. 13.15
(iii) If the paper like the one in Fig. 13.15 (c) is now cut into hundreds of little pieces,
along the lines drawn from the point O, each cut portion is almost a small triangle,
whose height is the slant height l of the cone.
(iv) Now the area of each triangle =
2  × base of each triangle × l.
So, area of the entire piece of paper
= sum of the areas of all the triangles
   ✁ =
2  × l × length of entire curved boundary of Fig. 13.15(c)
(as b1 + b2 + b3 + . . . makes up the curved portion of the figure)
But the curved portion of the figure makes up the perimeter of the base of the cone
and the circumference of the base of the cone = 2☎r, where r is the base radius of the
cone.
So, Curved Surface Area of a Cone = 1
2  × l × 2
where r is its base radius and l its slant height.
Note that l2 = r2 + h2 (as can be seen from Fig. 13.16), by
applying Pythagoras Theorem. Here h is the height of the
cone.
Fig. 13.16

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
Therefore, l =
 Now if the base of the cone is to be closed, then a circular piece of paper of radius r
is also required whose area is
So, Total Surface Area of a Cone =
✁rl +
✁r2 =
✁r(l + r)
Example 4 : Find the curved surface area of a right circular cone whose slant height
is 10 cm and base radius is 7 cm.
Solution : Curved surface area =
7  × 7 × 10 cm2
= 220 cm2
Example 5 : The height of a cone is 16 cm and its base radius is 12 cm. Find the
curved surface area and the total surface area of the cone (Use
✁ = 3.14).
Solution : Here, h = 16 cm and r = 12 cm.
So, from l2 = h2 + r2, we have
  cm = 20 cm
So, curved surface area =
= 3.14 × 12 × 20 cm2
= 753.6 cm2
Further, total surface area =
✁rl +
= (753.6 + 3.14 × 12 × 12) cm2
= (753.6 + 452.16) cm2
= 1205.76 cm2
Example 6 : A corn cob (see Fig. 13.17), shaped somewhat
like a cone, has the radius of its broadest end as 2.1 cm and
length (height) as 20 cm. If each 1 cm2 of the surface of the
cob carries an average of four grains, find how many grains
you would find on the entire cob.
Solution : Since the grains of corn are found only on the curved surface of the corn
cob, we would need to know the curved surface area of the corn cob to find the total
number of grains on it. In this question, we are given the height of the cone, so we
need to find its slant height.

404.41  cm = 20.11 cm
Therefore, the curved surface area of the corn cob =
7  × 2.1 × 20.11 cm2 = 132.726 cm2 = 132.73 cm2 (approx.)
Number of grains of corn on 1 cm2 of the surface of the corn cob = 4
Therefore, number of grains on the entire curved surface of the cob
= 132.73 × 4 = 530.92 = 531 (approx.)
So, there would be approximately 531 grains of corn on the cob.

13.5 Surface Area of a Sphere
What is a sphere? Is it the same as a circle? Can you draw a circle on a paper? Yes,
you can, because a circle is a plane closed figure whose every point lies at a constant
distance (called radius) from a fixed point, which is called the centre of the circle.
Now if you paste a string along a diameter of a circular disc and rotate it as you had
rotated the triangle in the previous section, you see a new solid (see Fig 13.18). What
does it resemble? A ball? Yes. It is called a sphere.
Fig. 13.18
Can you guess what happens to the centre of the circle, when it forms a sphere on
rotation? Of course, it becomes the centre of the sphere. So, a sphere is a three
dimensional figure (solid figure), which is made up of all points in the space,
which lie at a constant distance called the radius, from a fixed point called the
centre of the sphere.
Note : A sphere is like the surface of a ball. The word solid sphere is used for the
solid whose surface is a sphere.
Activity : Have you ever played with a top or have you at least watched someone
play with one? You must be aware of how a string is wound around it. Now, let us take
a rubber ball and drive a nail into it. Taking support of the nail, let us wind a string
around the ball. When you have reached the ‘fullest’ part of the ball, use pins to keep
the string in place, and continue to wind the string around the remaining part of the ball,
till you have completely covered the ball [see Fig. 13.19(a)]. Mark the starting and
finishing points on the string, and slowly unwind the string from the surface of the ball.
Now, ask your teacher to help you in measuring the diameter of the ball, from which
you easily get its radius. Then on a sheet of paper, draw four circles with radius equal

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
to the radius of the ball. Start filling the circles one by one, with the string you had
wound around the ball [see Fig. 13.19(b)].
Fig. 13.19
What have you achieved in all this?
The string, which had completely covered the surface area of the sphere, has been
used to completely fill the regions of four circles, all of the same radius as of the sphere.
So, what does that mean? This suggests that the surface area of a sphere of radius r
= 4 times the area of a circle of radius r = 4 × (
✁ r2)
Surface Area of a Sphere = 4
where r is the radius of the sphere.
How many faces do you see in the surface of a sphere? There is only one, which is
curved.
Now, let us take a solid sphere, and slice it exactly ‘through
the middle’ with a plane that passes through its centre. What
happens to the sphere?
Yes, it gets divided into two equal parts (see Fig. 13.20)!
What will each half  be called? It is called a hemisphere.
(Because ‘hemi’ also means ‘half’)
And what about the surface of a hemisphere? How many faces does it have?
Two! There is a curved face and a flat face (base).
The curved surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere, which

Therefore,
Curved Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 2
where r is the radius of the sphere of which the hemisphere is a part.
Now taking the two faces of a hemisphere, its surface area 2
✁r2 +
So, Total Surface Area of a Hemisphere = 3
Example 7 : Find the surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm.
Solution : The surface area of a sphere of radius 7 cm would be
✁r2 = 4 × 22
7  × 7 × 7 cm2 = 616 cm2
Example 8 : Find (i) the curved surface area and (ii) the total surface area of a
hemisphere of radius 21 cm.
Solution : The curved surface area of a hemisphere of radius 21 cm would be
✁r2 = 2 × 22
7  × 21 × 21 cm2 = 2772 cm2
(ii) the total surface area of the hemisphere would be
✁r2 = 3 × 22
7  × 21 × 21 cm2 = 4158 cm2
Example 9 : The hollow sphere, in which the circus motorcyclist performs his stunts,
has a diameter of 7 m. Find the area available to the motorcyclist for riding.
Solution : Diameter of the sphere = 7 m. Therefore, radius is 3.5 m. So, the riding
space available for the motorcyclist is the surface area of the ‘sphere’ which is
given by
✁r2 = 4 × 22
7  × 3.5 × 3.5 m2
= 154 m2
Example 10 : A hemispherical dome of a building needs to be painted
(see Fig. 13.21). If the circumference of the base of the dome is 17.6 m, find the cost
of painting it, given the cost of painting is Rs 5 per 100 cm2.
Solution : Since only the rounded surface of the dome is to be painted, we would need
to find the curved surface area of the hemisphere to know the extent of painting that
needs to be done. Now, circumference of the dome = 17.6 m. Therefore, 17.6 = 2

File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
So, the radius of the dome = 17.6 ×

The curved surface area of the dome = 2✁r2
= 2 × 22
7  × 2.8 × 2.8 m2
= 49.28 m2
Now, cost of painting 100 cm2 is Rs 5.
So, cost of painting 1 m2 = Rs 500
Therefore, cost of painting the whole dome
= Rs 500 × 49.28
= Rs 24640

13.6 Volume of a Cuboid
You have already learnt about volumes of certain figures (objects) in earlier classes.
Recall that solid objects occupy space. The measure of this occupied space is called
the Volume of the object.
Note : If an object is solid, then the space occupied by such an object is measured,
and is termed the Volume of the object. On the other hand, if the object is hollow, then
interior is empty, and can be filled with air, or some liquid that will take the shape of its
container. In this case, the volume of the substance that can fill the interior is called the
capacity of the container. In short, the volume of an object is the measure of the
space it occupies, and the capacity of an object is the volume of substance its interior
can accommodate. Hence, the unit of measurement of either of the two is cubic unit.
So, if we were to talk of the volume of a cuboid, we would be considering the
measure of the space occupied by the cuboid.
Further, the area or the volume is measured as the magnitude of a region. So,
correctly speaking, we should be finding the area of a circular region, or volume of a
cuboidal region, or volume of a spherical region, etc. But for the sake of simplicity, we
say, find the area of a circle, volume of a cuboid or a sphere even though these mean
only their boundaries.
Fig. 13.23
Observe Fig. 13.23. Suppose we say that the area of each rectangle is A, the
height up to which the rectangles are stacked is h and the volume of the cuboid is V.
Can you tell what would be the relationship between V, A and h?
The area of the plane region occupied by each rectangle × height
= Measure of the space occupied by the cuboid
So, we get
A × h = V
That is, Volume of a Cuboid = base area × height = length × breadth × height
or l × b × h, where l, b and h are respectively the length, breadth and height of the
cuboid.
SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
Note : When we measure the magnitude of the region of a space, that is, the
space occupied by a solid, we do so by counting the number of cubes of edge of unit
length that can fit into it exactly. Therefore, the unit of measurement of volume is
cubic unit.
Again
Volume of a Cube = edge × edge × edge = a3
where a is the edge of the cube (see Fig. 13.24).
So, if a cube has edge of 12 cm,
then volume of the cube = 12 × 12 × 12 cm3
= 1728 cm3.
Recall that you have learnt these formulae in
earlier classes. Now let us take some examples to
illustrate the use of these formulae:
Example11 : A wall of length 10 m was to be built across an open ground. The height
of the wall is 4 m and thickness of the wall is 24 cm. If this wall is to be built up with
bricks whose dimensions are 24 cm × 12 cm × 8 cm, how many bricks would be
required?
Solution : Since the wall with all its bricks makes up the space occupied by it, we
need to find the volume of the wall, which is nothing but a cuboid.
Here,
Length = 10 m = 1000 cm
Thickness = 24 cm
Height = 4 m = 400 cm
Therefore,
Volume of the wall = length × thickness × height
= 1000 × 24 × 400 cm3
Now, each brick is a cuboid with length = 24 cm, breadth = 12 cm and height = 8 cm
So, volume of each brick = length × breadth × height
= 24 × 12 × 8 cm3
So, number of bricks required =
volume of the wall
volume of each brick
= 1000 × 24 × 400
24 ×12 × 8
= 4166.6
So, the wall requires 4167 bricks.

Example 12 : A child playing with building blocks, which are
of the shape of cubes, has built a structure as shown in
Fig. 13.25. If the edge of each cube is 3 cm, find the volume
of the structure built by the child.
Solution : Volume of each cube = edge × edge × edge
= 3 × 3 × 3 cm3 = 27 cm3
Number of cubes in the structure = 15
Therefore, volume of the structure = 27 × 15 cm3
= 405 cm3

13.7 Volume of a Cylinder
Just as a cuboid is built up with rectangles of the same size, we have seen that a right
circular cylinder can be built up using circles of the same size. So, using the same
argument as for a cuboid, we can see that the volume of a cylinder can be obtained

as : base area × height
= area of circular base × height =
Volume of a Cylinder =
where r is the base radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
Example 13 : The pillars of a temple are cylindrically
shaped (see Fig. 13.26). If each pillar has a circular
base of radius 20 cm and height 10 m, how much
concrete mixture would be required to build 14 such
pillars?
Solution : Since the concrete mixture that is to be
used to build up the pillars is going to occupy the
entire space of the pillar, what we need to find here
is the volume of the cylinders.
Radius of base of a cylinder = 20 cm
Height of the cylindrical pillar = 10 m = 1000 cm
volume of each cylinder =
   cm3
= 8800000
= 8.8
7  m3 (Since 1000000 cm3 = 1m3)
Therefore, volume of 14 pillars = volume of each cylinder × 14
= 8.8
= 17.6 m3
So, 14 pillars would need 17.6 m3 of concrete mixture.

Fig. 13.26
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
Solution : The volume of juice in the vessel
= volume of the cylinderical vessel
(where R and H are taken as the radius and height respectively of the vessel)
✁ × 15 × 15 × 32 cm3
Similarly, the volume of juice each glass can hold =
(where r and h are taken as the radius and height respectively of each glass)
✁ × 3 × 3 × 8 cm3
So, number of glasses of juice that are sold
= volume of the vessel
volume of each glass
×15 ×15 × 32
× 3 × 3 × 8

Therefore, amount received by the stall keeper = Rs 3 × 100

Activity : Try to make a hollow cylinder and a hollow cone like this with the same

that will help us, to see practically what the volume of a right circular cone would be!
Fig. 13.29
Fig. 13.28
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-13\Chap-13 (02-01-06) PM65
So, let us start like this.
Fill the cone up to the brim with sand once, and empty it into the cylinder. We find
that it fills up only a part of the cylinder [see Fig. 13.29(a)].
When we fill up the cone again to the brim, and empty it into the cylinder, we see
that the cylinder is still not full [see Fig. 13.29(b)].
When the cone is filled up for the third time, and emptied into the cylinder, it can be
seen that the cylinder is also full to the brim [see Fig. 13.29(c)].
With this, we can safely come to the conclusion that three times the volume of a
cone, makes up the volume of a cylinder, which has the same base radius and the
same height as the cone, which means that the volume of the cone is one-third the
volume of the cylinder.
Volume of a Cone = 1
where r is the base radius and h is the height of the cone.
Example 15 : The height and the slant height of a cone are 21 cm and 28 cm
respectively. Find the volume of the cone.
Solution : From l2 = r2 + h2, we have
21 cm
7 7 cm
So, volume of the cone = 1

Example 16 : Monica has a piece of canvas whose area is 551 m2. She uses it to
have a conical tent made, with a base radius of 7 m. Assuming that all the stitching
margins and the wastage incurred while cutting, amounts to approximately 1 m2, find
the volume of the tent that can be made with it.
Solution : Since the area of the canvas = 551 m2 and area of the canvas lost in
wastage is 1 m2, therefore the area of canvas available for making the tent is
(551 – 1) m2 = 550 m2.
Now, the surface area of the tent = 550 m2 and the required base radius of the conical
tent = 7 m
Note that a tent has only a curved surface (the floor of a tent is not covered by
canvas!!).

13.9 Volume of a Sphere
Now, let us see how to go about measuring the volume of a sphere. First, take two or
three spheres of different radii, and a container big enough to be able to put each of
the spheres into it, one at a time. Also, take a large trough in which you can place the
container. Then, fill the container up to the brim with water [see Fig. 13.30(a)].
Now, carefully place one of the spheres in the container. Some of the water from
the container will over flow into the trough in which it is kept [see Fig. 13.30(b)].
Carefully pour out the water from the trough into a measuring cylinder (i.e., a graduated
cylindrical jar) and measure the water over flowed [see Fig. 13.30(c)]. Suppose the
radius of the immersed sphere is r (you can find the radius by measuring the diameter
of the sphere). Then evaluate 4
✁r3. Do you find this value almost equal to the
measure of the volume over flowed?
Fig. 13.30
Once again repeat the procedure done just now, with a different size of sphere.
Find the radius R of this sphere and then calculate the value of
4 R .
  Once again this
value is nearly equal to the measure of the volume of the water displaced (over flowed)
by the sphere. What does this tell us? We know that the volume of the sphere is the
same as the measure of the volume of the water displaced by it. By doing this experiment
repeatedly with spheres of varying radii, we are getting the same result, namely, the
volume of a sphere is equal to
✂ times the cube of its radius. This gives us the idea
Volume of a Sphere =
where r is the radius of the sphere.
Later, in higher classes it can be proved also. But at this stage, we will just take it
as true.

Since a hemisphere is half of a sphere, can you guess what the volume of a
hemisphere will be? Yes, it is
Volume of a Hemisphere =

Solution : Required volume = 4

Example 18 : A shot-putt is a metallic sphere of radius 4.9 cm. If the density of the
metal is 7.8 g per cm3, find the mass of the shot-putt.
Solution : Since the shot-putt is a solid sphere made of metal and its mass is equal to
the product of its volume and density, we need to find the volume of the sphere.
Now, volume of the sphere =
4.9 cm
= 493 cm3 (nearly)
Further, mass of 1 cm3 of metal is 7.8 g.
Therefore, mass of the shot-putt = 7.8 × 493 g
= 3845.44 g = 3.85 kg (nearly)

CHAPTER 14
STATISTICS
14.1 Introduction
Everyday we come across a wide variety of informations in the form of facts, numerical
figures, tables, graphs, etc. These are provided by newspapers, televisions, magazines
and other means of communication. These may relate to cricket batting or bowling
averages, profits of a company, temperatures of cities, expenditures in various sectors
of a five year plan, polling results, and so on. These facts or figures, which are numerical
or otherwise, collected with a definite purpose are called data. Data is the plural form
of the Latin word datum. Of course, the word ‘data’ is not new for you. You have
studied about data and data handling in earlier classes.
Our world is becoming more and more information oriented. Every part of our
lives utilises data in one form or the other. So, it becomes essential for us to know how
to extract meaningful information from such data. This  extraction of meaningful
information is studied in a branch of mathematics called Statistics.
The word ‘statistics’ appears to have been derived from the Latin word ‘status’
meaning ‘a (political) state’. In its origin, statistics was simply the collection of data on
different aspects of the life of people, useful to the State. Over the period of time,
however, its scope broadened and statistics began to concern itself not only with the
collection and presentation of data but also with the interpretation and drawing of
inferences from the data. Statistics deals with collection, organisation, analysis and
interpretation of data. The word ‘statistics’ has different meanings in different contexts.
Let us observe the following sentences:
1. May I have the latest copy of ‘Educational Statistics of India’.
2. I like to study ‘Statistics’ because it is used in day-to-day life.
In the first sentence, statistics is used in a plural sense, meaning numerical data. These
may include a number of educational institutions of India, literacy rates of various
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
states, etc. In the second sentence, the word ‘statistics’ is used as a singular noun,
meaning the subject which deals with the collection, presentation, analysis of data as
well as drawing of meaningful conclusions from the data.
In this chapter, we shall briefly discuss all these aspects regarding data.
14.2 Collection of Data
Let us begin with an exercise on gathering data by performing the following activity.
Activity 1 : Divide the students of your class into four groups. Allot each group the
work of collecting one of the following kinds of data:
(i) Heights of 20 students of your class.
(ii) Number of absentees in each day in your class for a month.
(iii) Number of members in the families of your classmates.
(iv) Heights of 15 plants in or around your school.
Let us move to the results students have gathered. How did they collect their data
in each group?
(i) Did they collect the information from each and every student, house or person
concerned for obtaining the information?
(ii) Did they get the information from some source like available school records?
In the first case, when the information was collected by the investigator herself or
himself with a definite objective in her or his mind, the data obtained is called primary
data.
In the second case, when the information was gathered from a source which
already had the information  stored, the data obtained is called secondary data. Such
data, which has been collected by someone else in another context, needs to be used
with great care ensuring that the source is reliable.
By now, you must have understood how to collect data and distinguish between
primary and secondary data.
EXERCISE 14.1
Give five examples of data that you can collect from your day-to-day life.
Classify the data in Q.1 above as primary or secondary data.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
14.3 Presentation of Data
As soon as the work related to collection of data is over, the investigator has to find out
ways to present them in a form which is meaningful, easily understood and gives its
main features at a glance. Let us now recall the various ways of presenting the data
through some examples.
Example 1 : Consider the marks obtained by 10 students in a mathematics test as
given below:
The data in this form is called raw data.
By looking at it in this form, can you find the highest and the lowest marks?
Did it take you some time to search for the maximum and minimum scores? Wouldn’t
it be less time consuming if these scores were arranged in ascending or descending
order? So let us arrange the marks in ascending order as
Now, we can clearly see that the lowest marks are 25 and the highest marks are 95.
The difference of the highest and the lowest values in the data is called the range of the
data. So, the range in this case is 95 – 25 = 70.
Presentation of data in ascending or descending order can be quite time consuming,
particularly when the number of observations in an experiment is large, as in the case
of the next example.
Example 2 : Consider the marks obtained (out of 100 marks) by 30 students of Class
IX of a school:
Recall that the number of students who have obtained a certain number of marks is
called the frequency of those marks. For instance, 4 students got 70 marks. So the
frequency of 70 marks is 4. To make the data more easily understandable, we write it
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
in a table, as given below:
Table 14.1
Marks
Number of students
(i.e., the frequency)
Total
Table 14.1 is called an ungrouped frequency distribution table, or simply a frequency
distribution table. Note that you can use also tally marks in preparing these tables,
as in the next example.
Example 3 : 100 plants each were planted in 100 schools during Van Mahotsava.
After one month, the number of plants that survived were recorded as :
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
To present such a large amount of data so that a reader can make sense of it easily,
we condense it into groups like 20-29, 30-39, . . ., 90-99 (since our data is from
23 to 98). These groupings are called ‘classes’ or ‘class-intervals’, and their size is
called the class-size or class width, which is 10 in this case. In each of these classes,
the least number is called the lower class limit and the greatest number is called the
upper class limit, e.g., in 20-29, 20 is the ‘lower class limit’ and 29 is the ‘upper class
limit’.
Also, recall that using tally marks, the data above can be condensed in tabular
form as follows:
Table 14.2
Number of plants
Tally Marks
Number of schools
survived
(frequency)
20 - 29
30 - 39
|||| |||| ||||
40 - 49
|||| |||| ||
50 - 59
|||| |||
60 - 69
|||| |||| |||| |||
70 - 79
|||| ||||
80 - 89
|||| |||| |||| |||| |||
90 - 99
|||| |||| ||
Total
Presenting data in this form simplifies and condenses data and enables us to observe
certain important features at a glance. This is called a grouped frequency distribution
table. Here we can easily observe that 50% or more plants survived in 8 + 18 + 10 +
23 + 12 = 71 schools.
We observe that the classes in the table above are non-overlapping. Note that we
could have made more classes of shorter size, or fewer classes of larger size also. For
instance, the intervals could have been 22-26, 27-31, and so on. So, there is no hard
and fast rule about this except that the classes should not overlap.
Example 4 : Let us now consider the following frequency distribution table which
gives the weights of 38 students of a class:
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65

Weights (in kg)

46 - 50
51 - 55
56 - 60
61 - 65
66 - 70
71 - 75
Total
Now, if two new students of weights 35.5 kg and 40.5 kg are admitted in this class,
then in which interval will we include them? We cannot add them in the ones ending
with 35 or 40, nor to the following ones. This is because there are gaps in between the
upper and lower limits of two consecutive classes. So, we need to divide the intervals
so that the upper and lower limits of consecutive intervals are the same. For this, we
find the difference between the upper limit of a class and the lower limit of its succeeding
class. We then add half of this difference to each of the upper limits and subtract the
same from each of the lower limits.
For example, consider the classes 31 - 35 and 36 - 40.
The lower limit of 36 - 40 = 36
The upper limit of 31 - 35 = 35
The difference = 36 – 35 = 1
half the difference = 1
2  = 0.5
So the new class interval formed from 31 - 35 is (31 – 0.5) - (35 + 0.5), i.e., 30.5 - 35.5.
Similarly, the new class formed from the class 36 - 40 is (36 – 0.5) - (40 + 0.5), i.e.,
35.5 - 40.5.
Continuing in the same manner, the continuous classes formed are:
30.5-35.5, 35.5-40.5, 40.5-45.5, 45.5-50.5, 50.5-55.5, 55.5-60.5,
60.5 - 65.5, 65.5 - 70.5, 70.5 - 75.5.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Now it is possible for us to include the weights of the new students in these classes.
But, another problem crops up because 35.5 appears in both the classes 30.5 - 35.5
and 35.5 - 40.5. In which class do you think this weight should be considered?
If it is considered in both classes, it will be counted twice.
By convention, we consider 35.5 in the class 35.5 - 40.5 and not in 30.5 - 35.5.
Similarly, 40.5 is considered in 40.5 - 45.5 and not  in 35.5 - 40.5.
So, the new weights 35.5 kg and 40.5 kg would be included in 35.5 - 40.5 and
40.5 - 45.5, respectively. Now, with these assumptions, the new frequency distribution
table will be as shown below:
Table 14.4

Now, let us move to the data collected by you in Activity 1. This time we ask you to
present these as frequency distribution tables.

distribution tables.Choose convenient classes with suitable class-sizes, keeping in mind
the range of the data and the type of data.

14.4 Graphical Representation of Data
The representation of data by tables has already been discussed. Now let us turn our
attention to another representation of data, i.e., the graphical representation. It is well
said that one picture is better than a thousand words. Usually comparisons among the
individual items are best shown by means of graphs. The representation then becomes
easier to understand than the actual data. We shall study the following graphical
representations in this section.
(A) Bar graphs
(B) Histograms of uniform width, and of varying widths
(C) Frequency polygons
(A) Bar Graphs
In earlier classes, you have already studied and constructed bar graphs. Here we
shall discuss them through a more formal approach. Recall that a bar graph is a
pictorial representation of data in which usually bars of uniform width are drawn with
equal spacing between them on one axis (say, the x-axis), depicting the variable. The
values of the variable are shown on the other axis (say, the y-axis) and the heights of
the bars depend on the values of the variable.
Example 5 : In a particular section of Class IX, 40 students were asked about the
months of their birth and the following graph was prepared for the data so obtained:
Fig. 14.1
Observe the bar graph given above and answer the following questions:
How many students were born in the month of November?
In which month were the maximum number of students born?
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Solution : Note that the variable here is the ‘month of birth’, and the value of the
variable is the ‘Number of students born’.
(i) 4 students were born in the month of November.
(ii) The Maximum number of students were born in the month of August.
Let us now recall how a bar graph is constructed by considering the following example.
Example 6 : A family with a monthly income of Rs 20,000 had planned the following
expenditures per month under various heads:
Table 14.5
Heads
Expenditure
(in thousand rupees)
Grocery
Education of children
Medicine
Entertainment
Miscellaneous
Draw a bar graph for the data above.
Solution : We draw the bar graph of this data in the following steps. Note that the unit
in the second column is thousand rupees. So, ‘4’ against ‘grocery’ means Rs 4000.
We represent the Heads (variable) on the horizontal axis choosing any scale,
since the width of the bar is not important. But for clarity, we take equal widths
for all bars and maintain equal gaps in between. Let one Head be represented by
one unit.
We represent the expenditure (value) on the vertical axis. Since the maximum
expenditure is Rs 5000, we can choose the scale as 1 unit = Rs 1000.
To represent our first Head, i.e., grocery, we draw a rectangular bar with width
1 unit and height 4 units.
Similarly, other Heads are represented leaving a gap of 1 unit in between two
consecutive bars.
The bar graph is drawn in Fig. 14.2.
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Fig. 14.2
Here, you can easily visualise the relative characteristics of the data at a glance, e.g.,
the expenditure on education is more than double that of medical expenses. Therefore,
in some ways it serves as a better representation of data than the tabular form.
Activity 3 : Continuing with the same four groups of Activity 1, represent the data by
suitable bar graphs.
Let us now see how a frequency distribution table for continuous class intervals
can be represented graphically.
(B) Histogram
This is a form of representation like the bar graph, but it is used for continuous class
intervals. For instance, consider the frequency distribution Table 14.6, representing
the weights of 36 students of a class:
Table 14.6
Weights (in kg)
Number of students
30.5 - 35.5
35.5 - 40.5
40.5 - 45.5
45.5 - 50.5
50.5 - 55.5
55.5 - 60.5
Total
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Let us represent the data given above graphically as follows:
We represent the weights on the horizontal axis on a suitable scale. We can choose
the scale as 1 cm = 5 kg. Also, since the first class interval is starting from 30.5
and not zero, we show it on the graph by marking a kink or a break on the axis.
(ii) We represent the number of students (frequency) on the vertical axis on a suitable
scale. Since the maximum frequency is 15, we need to choose the scale to
accomodate this maximum frequency.
(iii) We now draw rectangles (or rectangular bars) of width equal to the class-size
and lengths according to the frequencies of the corresponding class intervals. For
example, the rectangle for the class interval 30.5 - 35.5 will be of width 1 cm and
length 4.5 cm.
(iv) In this way, we obtain the graph as shown in Fig. 14.3:
Fig. 14.3
Observe that since there are no gaps in between consecutive rectangles, the resultant
graph appears like a solid figure. This is called a histogram, which is a graphical
representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. Also, unlike
a bar graph, the width of the bar plays a significant role in its construction.
Here, in fact, areas of the rectangles erected are proportional to the corresponding
frequencies. However, since the widths of the rectangles are all equal, the lengths of
the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies. That is why, we draw the lengths
according to (iii) above.
STATISTICS

Now, consider a situation different from the one above.
Example 7 : A teacher wanted to analyse the performance of two sections of students
in a mathematics test of 100 marks. Looking at their performances, she found that a
few students got under 20 marks and a few got 70 marks or above. So she decided to
group them into intervals of varying sizes as follows: 0 - 20, 20 - 30, . . ., 60 - 70,
70 - 100. Then she formed the following table:
Table 14.7
Marks
Number of students
0 - 20
20 - 30
30 - 40
40 - 50
50 - 60

Total
A histogram for this table was prepared by a student as shown in Fig. 14.4.
Fig. 14.4
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Carefully examine this graphical representation. Do you think that it correctly represents
the data? No, the graph is giving us a misleading picture. As we have mentioned
earlier, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies in a histogram.
Earlier this problem did not arise, because the widths of all the rectangles were equal.
But here, since the widths of the rectangles are varying, the histogram above does not
give a correct picture. For example, it shows a greater frequency in the interval
70 - 100, than in 60 - 70, which is not the case.
So, we need to make certain modifications in the lengths of the rectangles so that
the areas are again proportional to the frequencies.
The steps to be followed are as given below:
Select a class interval with the minimum class size. In the example above, the
minimum class-size is 10.
The lengths of the rectangles are then modified to be proportionate to the
class size 10.
For, instance, when the class size is 20, the length of the rectangle is 7. So when
the class size is 10, the length of the rectangle will be 7
  = 3.5.
Similarly, proceeding in this manner, we get the following table:
Table 14.8
Marks

Length of the rectangle

20 - 30
  = 10

  = 20
60 - 70
  = 15
70 - 100
= 2.67
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Since we have calculated these lengths for an interval of 10 marks in each case,
we may call these lengths as “proportion of students per 10 marks interval”.
So, the correct histogram with varying width is given in Fig. 14.5.
Fig. 14.5
(C) Frequency Polygon
There is yet another visual way of representing quantitative data and its frequencies.
This is a polygon. To see what we mean, consider the histogram represented by
Fig. 14.3. Let us join the mid-points of the upper sides of the adjacent rectangles of
this histogram by means of line segments. Let us call these mid-points B, C, D, E, F
and G. When joined by line segments, we obtain the figure BCDEFG (see Fig. 14.6).
To complete the polygon, we assume that there is a class interval with frequency zero
before 30.5 - 35.5, and one after 55.5 - 60.5, and their mid-points are A and H,
respectively. ABCDEFGH is the frequency polygon corresponding to the data shown
in Fig. 14.3. We have shown this in Fig. 14.6.

Fig. 14.6
Although, there exists no class preceding the lowest class and no class succeeding
the highest class, addition of the two class intervals with zero frequency enables us to
make the area of the frequency polygon the same as the area of the histogram. Why
is this so? (Hint : Use the properties of congruent triangles.)
Now, the question arises: how do we complete the polygon when there is no class
preceding the first class? Let us consider such a situation.

Draw a frequency polygon corresponding to this frequency distribution table.
Solution : Let us first draw a histogram for this data and mark the mid-points of the
tops of the rectangles as B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, respectively. Here, the first class is
0-10. So, to find the class preceeding 0-10, we extend the horizontal axis in the negative
direction and find the mid-point of the imaginary class-interval (–10) - 0. The first end
point, i.e., B is joined to this mid-point with zero frequency on the negative direction of
the horizontal axis. The point where this line segment meets the vertical axis is marked
as A. Let L be the mid-point of the class succeeding the last class of the given data.
Then OABCDEFGHIJKL is the frequency polygon, which is shown in Fig. 14.7.

Frequency polygons can also be drawn independently without drawing
histograms. For this, we require the mid-points of the class-intervals used in the data.
These mid-points of the class-intervals are called class-marks.
To find the class-mark of a class interval, we find the sum of the upper limit and
lower limit of a class and divide it by 2. Thus,
Class-mark = Upper limit + Lower limit
Let us consider an example.
Example 9 : In a city, the weekly observations made in a study on the cost of living
index are given in the following table:

Draw a frequency polygon for the data above (without constructing a histogram).
Solution : Since we want to draw a frequency polygon without a histogram, let us find
the class-marks of the classes given above, that is of 140 - 150, 150 - 160,....
For 140 - 150, the upper limit = 150, and the lower limit = 140
So, the class-mark = 150 + 140
= 290
2  = 145.
Continuing in the same manner, we find the class-marks of the other classes as well.

So, the new table obtained is as shown in the following table:

We can now draw a frequency polygon by plotting the class-marks along the horizontal
axis, the frequencies along the vertical-axis, and then plotting and joining the points
B(145, 5), C(155, 10), D(165, 20), E(175, 9), F(185, 6) and G(195, 2) by line segments.
We should not forget to plot the point corresponding to the class-mark of the class
130 - 140 (just before the lowest class 140 - 150) with zero frequency, that is,
A(135, 0), and the point H (205, 0) occurs immediately after G(195, 2). So, the resultant
frequency polygon will be ABCDEFGH (see Fig. 14.8).

Frequency polygons are used when the data is continuous and very large. It is
very useful for comparing two different sets of data of the same nature, for example,
comparing the performance of two different sections of the same class.

14.5 Measures of Central Tendency
Earlier in this chapter, we represented the data in various forms through frequency
distribution tables, bar graphs, histograms and frequency polygons. Now, the question
arises if we always need to study all the data to ‘make sense’ of it, or if we can make
out some important features of it by considering only certain representatives of the
data. This is possible, by using measures of central tendency or averages.
Consider a situation when two students Mary and Hari received their test copies.
The test had five questions, each carrying ten marks. Their scores were as follows:
Question Numbers
Mary’s score
Hari’s score
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Upon getting the test copies, both of them found their average scores as follows:
Mary’s average score = 42
5  = 8.4
Hari’s average score = 41
5  = 8.2
Since Mary’s average score was more than Hari’s, Mary claimed to have performed
better than Hari, but Hari did not agree. He arranged both their scores in ascending
order and found out the middle score as given below:
Mary’s Score
Hari’s Score
Hari said that since his middle-most score was 10, which was higher than Mary’s
middle-most score, that is 8, his performance should be rated better.
But Mary was not convinced. To convince Mary, Hari tried out another strategy.
He said he had scored 10 marks more often (3 times) as compared to Mary who
scored 10 marks only once. So, his performance was better.
Now, to settle the dispute between Hari and Mary, let us see the three measures
they adopted to make their point.
The average score that Mary found in the first case is the mean. The ‘middle’
score that Hari was using for his argument is the median. The most often scored mark
that Hari used in his second strategy is the mode.
Now, let us first look at the mean in detail.
The mean (or average) of a number of observations is the sum of the values of
all the observations divided by the total number of observations.
It is denoted by the symbol x , read as ‘x bar’.
Let us consider an example.
Example 10 : 5 people were asked about the time in a week they spend in doing
social work in their community. They said 10, 7, 13, 20 and 15 hours, respectively.
Find the mean (or average) time in a week devoted by them for social work.
Solution : We have already studied in our earlier classes that the mean of a certain
number of observations is equal to Sum of all the observations
Total number of observations
. To simplify our
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
working of finding the mean, let us use a variable xi to denote the ith observation. In
this case, i can take the values from 1 to 5. So our first observation is x1, second
observation is x2, and so on till x5.
Also x1 = 10 means that the value of the first observation, denoted by x1, is 10.
Similarly, x2 = 7, x3 = 13, x4 = 20 and x5 = 15.
Therefore, the mean x  =
Sum of all the observations
Total number of observations
    = 10
     = 65
5  = 13
So, the mean time spent by these 5 people in doing social work is 13 hours in a week.
Now, in case we are finding the mean time spent by 30 people in doing social
work, writing x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + x30 would be a tedious job.We use the Greek symbol
✂ (for the letter Sigma) for summation. Instead of writing x1 + x2 + x3 + . . . + x30, we
write
, which is read as ‘the sum of xi as i varies from 1 to 30’.
Similarly, for n observations
Example 11 : Find the mean of the marks obtained by 30 students of Class IX of a
school, given in Example 2.
Solution : Now,
= 10 + 20 + 36 + 92 + 95 + 40 + 50 + 56 + 60 + 70 + 92 + 88
80 + 70 + 72 + 70 + 36 + 40 + 36 + 40 + 92 + 40 + 50 + 50
56 + 60 + 70 + 60 + 60 + 88 = 1779
x  = 1779
30  = 59.3
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
Is the process not time consuming? Can we simplify it? Note that we have formed
a frequency table for this data (see Table 14.1).
The table shows that 1 student obtained 10 marks, 1 student obtained 20 marks, 3
students obtained 36 marks, 4 students obtained 40 marks, 3 students obtained 50
marks, 2 students obtained 56 marks, 4 students obtained 60 marks, 4 students obtained
70 marks, 1 student obtained 72 marks, 1 student obtained 80 marks, 2 students obtained
88 marks, 3 students obtained 92 marks and 1 student obtained 95 marks.
So, the total marks obtained = (1 × 10) + (1 × 20) + (3 × 36) + (4 × 40) + (3 × 50)
+ (2 × 56) + (4 × 60) + (4 × 70) + (1 × 72) + (1 × 80)
+ (2 × 88) + (3 × 92) + (1 × 95)
= f1x1 + . . . + f13x13, where fi is the frequency of the ith
entry inTable 14.1.
In brief, we write this as
So, the total marks obtained =
= f1 + f2 + . . . + f13
= 10 + 20 + 108 + 160 + 150 + 112 + 240 + 280 + 72 + 80
+ 176 + 276 + 95
= 1779
Now, the total number of observations
=  f1 + f2 + . . . + f13
= 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1
the mean x  =
Sum of all the observations
Total number of observations  =
= 1779
This process can be displayed in the following table, which is a modified form of
Table 14.1.

Thus, in the case of an ungrouped frequency distribution, you can use the formula
for calculating the mean.
Let us now move back to the situation of the argument between Hari and Mary,
and consider the second case where Hari found his performance better by finding the
middle-most score. As already stated, this measure of central tendency is called the
median.
The median is that value of the given number of observations, which divides it into
exactly two parts. So, when the data is arranged in ascending (or descending) order
the median of ungrouped data is calculated as follows:
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
When the number of observations (n) is odd, the median is the value of the
observation. For example, if n = 13, the value of the 13
, i.e.,
the 7th observation will be the median [see Fig. 14.9 (i)].
When the number of observations (n) is even, the median is the mean of the
and the
observations. For example, if n = 16, the mean of the
values of the 16
and the
observations, i.e., the mean of the
values of the 8th and 9th observations will be the median [see Fig. 14.9 (ii)].
Fig. 14.9
Let us illustrate this with the help of some examples.
Example 12 : The heights (in cm) of 9 students of a class are as follows:
Find the median of this data.
Solution : First of all we arrange the data in ascending order, as follows:
Since the number of students is 9, an odd number, we find out the median by finding
STATISTICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-14\Chap-14 (02-01-2006) PM65
the height of the
th = the 5th student, which is 149 cm.
So, the median, i.e. the medial height is 149 cm.
Example 13 : The points scored by a Kabaddi team in a series of matches are as
follows:
Find the median of the points scored by the team.
Solution : Arranging the points scored by the team in ascending order, we get
There are 16 terms. So there are two middle terms, i.e. the 16
2 th and
✞th, i.e.
the 8th and 9th terms.
So, the median is the mean of the values of the 8th and 9th terms.
i.e, the median = 10
So, the medial point scored by the Kabaddi team is 12.
Let us again go back to the unsorted dispute of Hari and Mary.
The third measure used by Hari to find the average was the mode.
The mode is that value of the observation which occurs most frequently, i.e., an
observation with the maximum frequency is called the mode.
The readymade garment and shoe industries make great use of this measure of
central tendency. Using the knowledge of mode, these industries decide which size of
the product should be produced in large numbers.
Let us illustrate this with the help of an example.
Example 14 : Find the mode of the following marks (out of 10) obtained by 20
students:
4, 6, 5, 9, 3, 2, 7, 7, 6, 5, 4, 9, 10, 10, 3, 4, 7, 6, 9, 9
Solution : We arrange this data in the following form :
2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10
Here 9 occurs most frequently, i.e., four times. So, the mode is 9.

Example 15 : Consider a small unit of a factory where there are 5 employees : a
supervisor and four labourers. The labourers draw a salary of Rs 5,000 per month
each while the supervisor gets Rs 15,000 per month. Calculate the mean, median and
mode of the salaries of this unit of the factory.
Solution : Mean = 5000
15000
     = 35000
= 7000
So, the mean salary is Rs 7000 per month.
To obtain the median, we arrange the salaries in ascending order:
5000,
5000,
5000,
5000,
15000
Since the number of employees in the factory is 5, the median is given by the
th = 3rd observation. Therefore, the median is Rs 5000 per month.
To find the mode of the salaries, i.e., the modal salary, we see that 5000 occurs the
maximum number of times in the data 5000, 5000, 5000, 5000, 15000. So, the modal
salary is Rs 5000 per month.
Now compare the three measures of central tendency for the given data in the
example above. You can see that the mean salary of Rs 7000 does not give even an
approximate estimate of any one of their wages, while the medial and modal salaries
of Rs 5000 represents the data more effectively.
Extreme values in the data affect the mean. This is one of the weaknesses of the
mean. So, if the data has a few points which are very far from most of the other
points, (like 1,7,8,9,9) then the mean is not a good representative of this data. Since the
median and mode are not affected by extreme values present in the data, they give a
better estimate of the average in such a situation.
Again let us go back to the situation of Hari and Mary, and compare the three
measures of central tendency.

This comparison helps us in stating that these measures of central tendency are not
sufficient for concluding which student is better. We require some more information to
conclude this, which you will study about in the higher classes.

CHAPTER 15
PROBABILITY
It is remarkable that a science, which began with the consideration of
games of chance, should be elevated to the rank of the most important
subject of human knowledge.
—Pierre Simon Laplace
15.1 Introduction
In everyday life, we come across statements such as
(1) It will probably rain today.
(2) I doubt that he will pass the test.
(3) Most probably, Kavita will stand first in the annual examination.
(4) Chances are high that the prices of diesel will go up.
(5) There is a 50-50 chance of India winning a toss in today’s match.
The words ‘probably’, ‘doubt’, ‘most probably’, ‘chances’, etc., used in the
statements above involve an element of uncertainty. For example, in (1), ‘probably
rain’ will mean it may rain or may not rain today. We are predicting rain today based
on our past experience when it rained under similar conditions. Similar predictions are
also made in other cases listed in (2) to (5).
The uncertainty of ‘probably’ etc can be measured numerically by means of
‘probability’ in many cases.
Though probability started with gambling, it has been used extensively in the fields
of Physical Sciences, Commerce, Biological Sciences, Medical Sciences, Weather
Forecasting, etc.

15.2 Probability – an Experimental Approach
The concept of probability developed in a very
strange manner. In 1654, a gambler Chevalier
de Mere, approached the well-known 17th
century French philosopher and mathematician
Blaise Pascal regarding certain dice problems.
Pascal became interested in these problems,
studied them and discussed them with another
French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat. Both
Pascal and Fermat solved the problems
independently. This work was the beginning
of Probability Theory.
The first book on the subject was written by the Italian mathematician, J.Cardan
(1501–1576). The title of the book was ‘Book on Games of Chance’ (Liber de Ludo
Aleae), published in 1663. Notable contributions were also made by mathematicians
J. Bernoulli (1654–1705), P. Laplace (1749–1827), A.A. Markov (1856–1922) and A.N.
Kolmogorov (born 1903).
In earlier classes, you have had a glimpse of probability when you performed
experiments like tossing of coins, throwing of dice, etc., and observed their outcomes.
You will now learn to measure the chance of occurrence of a particular outcome in an
experiment.
Activity 1 : (i) Take any coin, toss it ten times and note down the number of times a
head and a tail come up. Record your observations in the form of the following table

(ii) Toss the coin twenty times and in the same way record your observations as
above. Again find the values of the fractions given above for this collection of
observations.
(iii) Repeat the same experiment by increasing the number of tosses and record
the number of heads and tails. Then find the values of the corresponding
fractions.
You will find that as the number of tosses gets larger, the values of the fractions
come closer to 0.5. To record what happens in more and more tosses, the following
group activity can also be performed:
Acitivity 2 : Divide the class into groups of 2 or 3 students. Let a student in each
group toss a coin 15 times. Another student in each group should record the observations
regarding heads and tails. [Note that coins of the same denomination should be used in
all the groups. It will be treated as if only one coin has been tossed by all the groups.]
Now, on the blackboard, make a table like Table 15.2. First, Group 1 can write
down its observations and calculate the resulting fractions. Then Group 2 can write
down its observations, but will calculate the fractions for the combined data of Groups
1 and 2, and so on. (We may call these fractions as cumulative fractions.) We have
noted the first three rows based on the observations given by one class of students.

Group

Cumulative number of heads Cumulative number of tails

What do you observe in the table? You will find that as the total number of tosses
of the coin increases, the values of the fractions in Columns (4) and (5) come nearer
and nearer to 0.5.
Activity 3 : (i) Throw a die* 20 times and note down the number of times the numbers
*A die is a well balanced cube with its six faces marked with numbers from 1 to 6, one number
on one face. Sometimes dots appear in place of numbers.

Number of times a die is thrown
Number of times these scores turn up
Find the values of the following fractions:
Number of times 1 turned up
Total number of times the die is thrown
Number of times 2 turned up
Total number of times the die is thrown
  Number of times 6 turned up
Total number of times the die is thrown
(ii) Now throw the die 40 times, record the observations and calculate the fractions
as done in (i).
As the number of throws of the die increases, you will find that the value of each
fraction calculated in (i) and (ii) comes closer and closer to 1
To see this, you could perform a group activity, as done in Activity 2. Divide the
students in your class, into small groups. One student in each group should throw a die
ten times. Observations should be noted and cumulative fractions should be calculated.
The values of the fractions for the number 1 can be recorded in Table 15.4. This
table can be extended to write down fractions for the other numbers also or other
tables of the same kind can be created for the other numbers.

The dice used in all the groups should be almost the same in size and appearence.

Now increase the number of tosses (as in Activitiy 2). You will find that the more
the number of tosses, the closer are the values of A, B and C to 0.25, 0.5 and 0.25,
respectively.
In Activity 1, each toss of a coin is called a trial. Similarly in Activity 3, each
throw of a die is a trial, and each simultaneous toss of two coins in Activity 4 is also a
trial.
So, a trial is an action which results in one or several outcomes. The possible
outcomes in Activity 1 were Head and Tail; whereas in Activity 3, the possible outcomes
were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
In Activity 1, the getting of a head in a particular throw is an event with outcome
‘head’. Similarly, getting a tail is an event with outcome ‘tail’. In Activity 2, the
getting of a particular number, say 1, is an event with outcome 1.
If our experiment was to throw the die for getting an even number, then the event
would consist of three outcomes, namely, 2, 4 and 6.
So, an event for an experiment is the collection of some outcomes of the experiment.
In Class X, you will study a more formal definition of an event.
So, can you now tell what the events are in Activity 4?
With this background, let us now see what probability is. Based on what we directly
observe as the outcomes of our trials, we find the experimental or empirical probability.
Let n be the total number of trials. The empirical probability P(E) of an event E
happening, is given by
P(E) = Number of trials in which the event happened
The total number of trials
In this chapter, we shall be finding the empirical probability, though we will write
‘probability’ for convenience.
Let us consider some examples.
To start with let us go back to Activity 2, and Table 15.2. In Column (4) of this
table, what is the fraction that you calculated? Nothing, but it is the empirical probability
of getting a head. Note that this probability kept changing depending on the number of
trials and the number of heads obtained in these trials. Similarly, the empirical probability
of getting a tail is obtained in Column (5) of Table 15.2. This is 12
15  to start with, then
it is 2
3 , then 28
45 , and so on.
So, the empirical probability depends on the number of trials undertaken, and the
number of times the outcomes you are looking for coming up in these trials.

Activity 5 : Before going further, look at the tables you drew up while doing
Activity 3. Find the probabilities of getting a 3 when throwing a die a certain number
of times. Also, show how it changes as the number of trials increases.
Now let us consider some other examples.
Example 1 : A coin is tossed 1000 times with the following frequencies:
Head : 455, Tail : 545
Compute the probability for each event.
Solution : Since the coin is tossed 1000 times, the total number of trials is 1000. Let us
call the events of getting a head and of getting a tail as E and F, respectively. Then, the
number of times E happens, i.e., the number of times a head come up, is 455.
the probability of E =
Number of heads
Total number of trials
i.e.,
P (E) =
1000  = 0.455
Similarly, the probability of the event of getting a tail =
Number of tails
Total number of trials
i.e.,
P(F) = 545
1000  = 0.545
Note that in the example above, P(E) + P(F) = 0.455 + 0.545 = 1, and E and F are
the only two possible outcomes of each trial.
Example 2 : Two coins are tossed simultaneously 500 times, and we get
Two heads : 105 times
One head : 275 times
No head : 120 times
Find the probability of occurrence of each of these events.
Solution : Let us denote the events of getting two heads, one head and no head by E1,
E2 and E3, respectively. So,
P(E1) = 105
500  = 0.21
P(E2) = 275
500  = 0.55
P(E3) = 120
500  = 0.24
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-15\Chap-15 (02-01-2006) PM65
Observe that P(E1) + P(E2) + P(E3) = 1. Also E1, E2 and E3 cover all the outcomes
of a trial.
Example 3 : A die is thrown 1000 times with the frequencies for the outcomes 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 as given in the following table :
Table 15.6
Outcome
Frequency
Find the probability of getting each outcome.
Solution : Let Ei denote the event of getting the outcome i, where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Probability of the outcome 1 =
P(E1) =
Frequency of 1
Total number of times the die is thrown
= 179
1000  = 0.179
Similarly,
P(E2) =
1000  = 0.15,
P(E3) = 157
1000  = 0.157,
P(E4) =
1000  = 0.149,
P(E5) = 175
1000  = 0.175
P(E6) =
1000  = 0.19.
Note that P(E1) + P(E2) + P(E3) + P(E4) + P(E5) + P(E6) = 1
Also note that:
The probability of each event lies between 0 and 1.
(ii) The sum of all the probabilities is 1.
(iii) E1, E2, . . ., E6 cover all the possible outcomes of a trial.
Example 4 : On one page of a telephone directory, there were 200 telephone numbers.
The frequency distribution of their unit place digit (for example, in the number 25828573,
the unit place digit is 3) is given in Table 15.7 :

Solution : The probability of digit 6 being in the unit place
Frequency of 6
Total number of selected telephone numbers
200  = 0.07
You can similarly obtain the empirical probabilities of the occurrence of the numbers
having the other digits in the unit place.
Example 5 : The record of a weather station shows that out of the past 250 consecutive
days, its weather forecasts were correct 175 times.
(i) What is the probability that on a given day it was correct?
(ii) What is the probability that it was not correct on a given day?
Solution : The total number of days for which the record is available = 250
P(the forecast was correct on a given day)
Number of days when the forecast was correct
Total number of days for  which the record is available
= 175
250  = 0.7
The number of days when the forecast was not correct = 250 – 175 = 75
So, P(the forecast was not correct on a given day) = 75
250  = 0.3
Notice that:
P(forecast was correct on a given day) + P(forecast was not correct on a given day)
= 0.7 + 0.3 = 1

Example 6 : A tyre manufacturing company kept a record of the distance covered
before a tyre needed to be replaced. The table shows the results of 1000 cases.
Table 15.8
Distance (in km) less than 4000 4000 to 9000 9001 to 14000 more than 14000
Frequency
If you buy a tyre of this company, what is the probability that :
(i) it will need to be replaced before it has covered 4000 km?
(ii) it will last more than 9000 km?
(iii) it will need to be replaced after it has covered somewhere between 4000 km
and 14000 km?
Solution : (i) The total number of trials = 1000.
The frequency of a tyre that needs to be replaced before it covers 4000 km is 20.
So, P(tyre to be replaced before it covers 4000 km) = 20
1000  = 0.02
(ii) The frequency of a tyre that will last more than 9000 km is 325 + 445 = 770
So, P(tyre will last more than 9000 km) = 770
1000  = 0.77
(iii) The frequency of a tyre that requires replacement between 4000 km and
14000 km is 210 + 325 = 535.
So, P(tyre requiring replacement between 4000 km and 14000 km) = 535
1000  = 0.535

Solution : The total number of unit tests held is 5.

So, P(scoring more than 70% marks) = 3
5  = 0.6
Example 8 : An insurance company selected 2000 drivers at random (i.e., without
any preference of one driver over another) in a particular city to find a relationship
between age and accidents. The data obtained are given in the following table:

Above 50
Find the probabilities of the following events for a driver chosen at random from the
city:
(i) being 18-29 years of age and having exactly 3 accidents in one year.
(ii) being 30-50 years of age and having one or more accidents in a year.
(iii) having no accidents in one year.
Solution : Total number of drivers = 2000.
(i) The number of drivers who are 18-29 years old and have exactly 3 accidents
in one year is 61.
So, P (driver is 18-29 years old with exactly 3 accidents) = 61
= 0.0305
✁ 0.031
(ii) The number of drivers 30-50 years of age and having one or more accidents
in one year = 125 + 60 + 22 + 18 = 225
So, P(driver is 30-50 years of age and having one or more accidents)
= 225
2000  = 0.1125
✁ 0.113
(iii) The number of drivers having no accidents in one year = 440 + 505 + 360
= 1305
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-15\Chap-15 (02-01-2006) PM65
Therefore, P(drivers with no accident) = 1305

Example 9 : Consider the frequency distribution table (Table 14.3,  Example 4,
Chapter 14), which gives the weights of 38 students of a class.
(i) Find the probability that the weight of a student in the class lies in the interval
46-50 kg.
(ii) Give two events in this context, one having probability 0 and the other having
probability 1.
Solution : (i) The total number of students is 38, and the number of students with
weight in the interval 46 - 50 kg is 3.
So, P(weight of a student is in the interval 46 - 50 kg) = 3
38  = 0.079
(ii) For instance, consider the event that a student weighs 30 kg. Since no student has
this weight, the probability of occurrence of this event is 0. Similarly, the probability
of a student weighing more than 30 kg is 38
38  = 1.
Example 10 : Fifty seeds were selected at random from each of 5 bags of seeds, and
were kept under standardised conditions favourable to germination. After 20 days, the

Number of seeds
germinated
What is the probability of germination of
more than 40 seeds in a bag?
49 seeds in a bag?
(iii) more that 35 seeds in a bag?
Solution : Total number of bags is 5.
Number of bags in which more than 40 seeds germinated out of 50 seeds is 3.
P(germination of more than 40 seeds in a bag) = 5
   = 0.6
PROBABILLITY
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Chap-15\Chap-15 (02-01-2006) PM65
Number of bags in which 49 seeds germinated = 0.
P(germination of 49 seeds in a bag) = 0
5  = 0.
(iii) Number of bags in which more than 35 seeds germinated = 5.
So, the required probability = 5
5  = 1.
Remark : In all the examples above, you would have noted that the probability of an
event can be any fraction from 0 to 1.

EXERCISE 5.1
False. This can be seen visually by the student.
(ii) False. This contradicts Axiom 5.1.
(iii) True. (Postulate 2)
(iv) True. If you superimpose the region bounded by one circle on the other, then they
coincide. So, their centres and boundaries coincide. Therefore, their radii will
coincide.
(v) True. The first axiom of Euclid.
There are several undefined terms which the student should list. They are consistent,
because they deal with two different situations — (i) says that given two points A and
B, there is a point C lying on the line in between them; (ii) says that given A and B, you
can take C not lying on the line through A and B.
These ‘postulates’ do not follow from Euclid’s postulates. However, they follow from
Axiom 5.1.
AC = BC
AC + AC = BC + AC
(Equals are added to equals)
i.e.,
2AC = AB
(BC + AC coincides with AB)
Therefore,
AC = 1
2  AB
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Answers (16–12–2005) PM65
Make a temporary assumption that different points C and D are two mid-points of AB.
Now, you show that points C and D are not two different points.
AC = BD
(Given)
AC = AB + BC
(Point B lies between A and C)
BD = BC + CD
(Point C lies between B and D)
Substituting (2) and (3) in (1), you get
AB + BC = BC + CD
AB = CD
(Subtracting equals from equals)
Since this is true for any thing in any part of the world, this is a universal truth.
EXERCISE 5.2
Any formulation the student gives should be discussed in the class for its validity.
If a straight line l falls on two straight lines m and n such that sum of the interior angles
on one side of l is two right angles, then by Euclid’s fifth postulate the line will not meet
on this side of l. Next, you know that the sum of the interior angles on the other side of
line l will also be two right angles. Therefore, they will not meet on the other side also.
So, the lines m and n never meet and are, therefore, parallel.

For n = 11, 2n2 + 11 = 253 which is not a prime.
(vi) For n = 41, n2 – n  + 41 is not a prime.
Student’s own answer.
Let x and y be two odd numbers. Then x = 2m +1 for some natural number m and
y = 2n + 1 for some natural number n.
x + y = 2 (m + n + 1). Therefore, x + y is divisible by 2 and is even.
See Q.3. xy = (2m + 1)(2n + 1) = 2 (2mn + m + n) + 1.
Therefore, x y is not divisible by 2, and so it is odd.
Let 2n, 2n + 2 and 2n + 4 be three consecutive even numbers. Then their sum is
6(n + 1), which is divisible by 6.
Let your original number be n. Then we are doing the following operations:
✠ 2 n + 9
✠ 2 n +  9 + n = 3n + 9
  = n + 3
✠  n + 3 + 4 = n + 7
n + 7 – n = 7.
Note that 7 × 11 × 13 = 1001. Take any three digit number say, abc. Then
abc × 1001 = abcabc. Therefore, the six digit number abcabc is divisible by 7, 11
and 13.

EXERCISE A2.1
Step 1: Formulation :
The relevant factors are the time period for hiring a computer, and the two costs given
to us. We assume that there is no significant change in the cost of purchasing or
hiring the computer. So, we treat any such change as irrelevant. We also treat all
brands and generations of computers as the same, i.e. these differences are also
irrelevant.
The expense of hiring the computer for x months is Rs 2000x.  If this becomes more
than the cost of purchasing a computer, we will be better off buying a computer.  So,
the equation is
2000 x = 25000
Step 2 : Solution : Solving (1), x = 25000
2000  = 12.5
Step 3 : Interpretation : Since the cost of hiring a computer becomes more after 12.5
months, it is cheaper to buy a computer, if you have to use it for more than 12 months.
Step1 : Formulation : We will assume that cars travel at a constant speed. So, any
change of speed will be treated as irrelevant. If the cars meet after x hours, the first car
would have travelled a distance of 40x km from A and the second car would have
travelled 30x km, so that it will be at a distance of (100 – 30x) km from A. So the
equation will be 40x = 100 – 30x, i.e., 70x = 100.
Step 2 : Solution : Solving the equation, we get x = 100
Step 3 : Interpretation : 100
is approximately 1.4 hours.  So, the cars will meet after
1.4 hours.
Step1: Formulation : The speed at which the moon orbits the earth is
Length of the orbit
Time taken
Step 2 : Solution : Since the orbit is nearly circular, the length is 2 ×
✁ × 384000 km
= 2411520 km
The moon takes 24 hours to complete one orbit.
So, speed = 2411520
= 100480 km/hour.
Step 3 : Interpretation : The speed is 100480 km/h.
Formulation : An assumption is that the difference in the bill is only because of using
the water heater.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Answers (16–12–2005) PM65
Let the average number of hours for which the water heater is used = x
Difference per month due to using water heater = Rs 1240 – Rs 1000 = Rs 240
Cost of using water heater for one hour = Rs 8
So, the cost of using the water heater for 30 days = 8 × 30 × x
Also, the cost of using the water heater for 30 days = Difference in bill due to using
water heater
240x = 240
Solution : From this equation, we get x = 1.
Interpretation : Since x = 1, the water heater is used for an average of 1 hour in a day.

PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
In fact, proofs in mathematics have been in existence for thousands of years, and
they are central to any branch of mathematics. The first known proof is believed to
have been given by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales. While
mathematics was central to many ancient civilisations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, China
and India, there is no clear evidence that they used proofs the way we do today.
In this chapter, we will look at what a statement is, what kind of reasoning is
involved in mathematics, and what a mathematical proof consists of.
A1.2 Mathematically Acceptable Statements
In this section, we shall try to explain the meaning of a mathematically acceptable
statement. A ‘ statement’  is a sentence which is not an order or an exclamatory sentence.
And, of course, a statement is not a question! For example,
“ What is the colour of your hair?”   is not a statement, it is a question.
“ Please go and bring me some water.”   is a request or an order, not a statement.
“ What a marvellous sunset!”  is an exclamatory remark, not a statement.
However, “ The colour of your hair is black”  is a statement.
In general, statements can be one of the following:
  alw ay s true
  alw ay s f alse
  am biguous
The word ‘ ambiguous’  needs some explanation.  There are two situations which
make a statement ambiguous. The first situation is when we cannot decide if the
statement is always true or always false. For example, “ Tomorrow is Thursday”  is
ambiguous, since enough of a context is not given to us to decide if the statement is
true or false.
The second situation leading to ambiguity is when the statement is subjective, that
is, it is true for some people and not true for others. For example, “ Dogs are intelligent”
is ambiguous because some people believe this is true and others do not.
Example 1 : State whether the following statements are always true, always false or
ambiguous. Justify your answers.
There are 8 days in a week.
It is raining here.
(iii)
The sun sets in the west.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
Gauri is a kind girl.
The product of two odd integers is even.
The product of two even natural numbers is even.
Solution :
This statement is always false, since there are 7 days in a week.
This statement is ambiguous, since it is not clear where ‘ here’  is.
(iii)
This statement is always true. The sun sets in the west no matter where we live.
This statement is ambiguous, since it is subjective– Gauri may be kind to some
and not to others.
This statement is always false. The product of two odd integers is always odd.
This statement is always true. However, to justify that it is true we need to do
some work. It will be proved in Section A1.4.
As mentioned before, in our daily life, we are not so careful about the validity of
statements. For example, suppose your friend tells you that in July it rains everyday in
Manantavadi, Kerala. In all probability, you will believe her, even though it may not
have rained for a day or two in July. Unless you are a lawyer, you will not argue with
As another example, consider statements we
often make to each other like “ it is very hot today” .
We easily accept such statements because we know
the context even though these statements are
ambiguous. ‘ It is very hot today’  can mean different
things to different people because what is very hot
for a person from Kumaon may not be hot for a person
from Chennai.
But a mathematical statement cannot be ambiguous. In mathematics, a statement
is only acceptable or valid, if it is either true or false. We say that a statement is
true, if it is always true otherwise it is called a false statement.
For example, 5 + 2 = 7 is always true, so ‘ 5 + 2 = 7’  is a true statement and
5 + 3 = 7 is a false statement.
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
Example 2 : State whether the following statements are true or false:
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.
(ii) Every odd number greater than 1 is prime.
(iii) For any real number x, 4x + x = 5x.
(iv) For every real number x, 2x > x.
(v) For every real number x, x2
(vi) If a quadrilateral has all its sides equal, then it is a square.
Solution :
This statement is true. You have already proved this in Chapter 6.
(ii) This statement is false; for example, 9 is not a prime number.
(iii) This statement is true.
(iv) This statement is false; for example, 2 × (– 1) = – 2, and – 2 is not greater than – 1.
(v) This statement is false; for example,
, and 1
4  is not greater than 1
(vi) This statement is false, since a rhombus has equal sides but need not be a square.
You might have noticed that to establish that a statement is not true according to
mathematics, all we need to do is to find one case or example where it breaks down.
So in (ii), since 9 is not a prime, it is an example that shows that the statement “ Every
odd number greater than 1 is prime”  is not true. Such an example, that counters a
statement, is called a counter-example. We shall discuss counter-examples in greater
detail in Section A1.5.
You might have also noticed that while Statements (iv), (v) and (vi) are false, they
can be restated with some conditions in order to make them true.
Example 3 : Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that
they become true statements.
For every real number x, 2x > x.
(ii) For every real number x, x2
(iii) If you divide a number by itself, you will always get 1.
(iv) The angle subtended by a chord of a circle at a point on the circle is 90°.
(v) If a quadrilateral has all its sides equal, then it is a square.
MATHEMATICS

Solution :
If x > 0, then 2x > x.
(ii) If x
  0 or x
✁ 1, then  x2
(iii) If you divide a number except zero by itself, you will always get 1.
(iv) The angle subtended by a diameter of a circle at a point on the circle is 90°.
(v) If a quadrilateral has all its sides and interior angles equal, then it is a square.
EXERCISE A1.1
State whether the following statements are always true, always false or ambiguous.
Justify your answers.
There are 13 months in a year.
(ii) Diwali falls on a Friday.
(iii) The temperature in Magadi is 260 C.

(v) Dogs can fly.
(vi) February has only 28 days.
State whether the following statements are true or false. Give reasons for your answers.
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 350°.
(ii) For any real number x, x2
(iii) A rhombus is a parallelogram.

Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that they become
true statements.
All prime numbers are odd.
(ii) Two times a real number is always even.
(iii) For any x, 3x +1 > 4.
(iv) For any x, x3
(v) In every triangle, a median is also an angle bisector.
A1.3 Deductive Reasoning
The main logical tool used in establishing the truth of an unambiguous statement is
deductiv e reasoning. To understand what deductive reasoning is all about, let us
begin with a puzzle for you to solve.
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
You are given four cards. Each card has a number printed on one side and a letter
on the other side.
Suppose you are told that these cards follow the rule:
“ If a card has an even number on one side, then it has a vowel on the other side.”
What is the smallest number of cards you need to turn over to check if the rule
is true?
Of course, you have the option of turning over all the cards and checking. But can
you manage with turning over a fewer number of cards?
Notice that the statement mentions that a card with an even number on one side
has a vowel on the other. It does not state that a card with a vowel on one side must
have an even number on the other side. That may or may not be so. The rule also does
not state that a card with an odd number on one side must have a consonant on the
other side. It may or may not.
So, do we need to turn over ‘ A’ ? No! Whether there is an even number or an odd
number on the other side, the rule still holds.
What about ‘ 5’ ? Again we do not need to turn it over, because whether there is a
vowel or a consonant on the other side, the rule still holds.
But you do need to turn over V and 6. If V has an even number on the other side,
then the rule has been broken. Similarly, if 6 has a consonant on the other side, then the
rule has been broken.
The kind of reasoning we have used to solve this puzzle is called deductive
reasoning. It is called ‘ deductive’  because we arrive at (i.e., deduce or infer) a result
or a statement from a previously established statement using logic. For example, in the
puzzle above, by a series of logical arguments we deduced that we need to turn over
only V and 6.
Deductive reasoning also helps us to conclude that a particular statement is true,
because it is a special case of a more general statement that is known to be true. For
example, once we prove that the product of two odd numbers is always odd, we can
immediately conclude (without computation) that 70001 × 134563 is odd simply because
70001 and 134563 are odd.

Deductive reasoning has been a part of human thinking for centuries, and is used
all the time in our daily life. For example, suppose the statements “ The flower Solaris
blooms, only if the maximum temperature is above 28° C on the previous day”  and
“ Solaris bloomed in Imaginary Valley on 15th September, 2005”  are true. Then using
deductive reasoning, we can conclude that the maximum temperature in Imaginary
Valley on 14th September, 2005 was more than 28° C.
Unfortunately we do not always use correct reasoning in our daily life! We often
come to many conclusions based on faulty reasoning. For example, if your friend does
not smile at you one day, then you may conclude that she is angry with you.  While it
may be true that “ if she is angry with me, she will not smile at me” , it may also be true
that “ if she has a bad headache, she will not smile at me” . Why don’ t you examine
some conclusions that you have arrived at in your day-to-day existence, and see if
they are based on valid or faulty reasoning?
EXERCISE A1.2
Use deductive reasoning to answer the following:
Humans are mammals. All mammals are vertebrates.  Based on these two
statements, what can you conclude about humans?
(ii) Anthony is a barber. Dinesh had his hair cut. Can you conclude that Antony cut
Dinesh’ s hair?
(iii) Martians have red tongues. Gulag is a Martian. Based on these two statements,
what can you conclude about Gulag?
(iv) If it rains for more than four hours on a particular day, the gutters will have to be
cleaned the next day. It has rained for 6 hours today. What can we conclude
about the condition of the gutters tomorrow?
(v) What is the fallacy in the cow’ s reasoning in the cartoon below?
All dogs have tails.
I have a tail.
Therefore I am a

Once again you are given four cards. Each card has a number printed on one side and
a letter on the other side. Which are the only two cards you need to turn over to check
whether the following rule holds?
“ If a card has a consonant on one side, then it has an odd number on the other side.”
A1.4 Theorems, Conjectures and Axioms
So far we have discussed statements and how to check their validity. In this section,
you will study how to distinguish between the three different kinds of statements
mathematics is built up from, namely, a theorem, a conjecture and an axiom.
You have already come across many theorems before.  So, what is a theorem? A
mathematical statement whose truth has been established (proved) is called a theorem.
For example, the following statements are theorems, as you will see in Section A1.5.
Theorem A1.1 : The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180º.
Theorem A1.2 : The product of two even natural numbers is even.
Theorem A1.3 : The product of any  three consecutiv e ev en natural numbers is
divisible by 16.
A conjecture is a statement which we believe is true, based on our mathematical
understanding and experience, that is, our mathematical intuition. The conjecture may
turn out to be true or false. If we can prove it, then it becomes a theorem.
Mathematicians often come up with conjectures by looking for patterns and making
intelligent mathematical guesses. Let us look at some patterns and see what kind of
intelligent guesses we can make.
Example 4 : Take any three consecutive even numbers and add them, say,
2 + 4 + 6 = 12, 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, 6 + 8 + 10 = 24, 8 +10 + 12 = 30, 20 + 22 +  24 = 66.
Is there any pattern you can guess in these sums? What can you conjecture about
them?
Solution : One conjecture could be :
the sum of three consecutive even numbers is even.
Another could be :
(ii) the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by 6.
MATHEMATICS

Example 5 : Consider the following pattern of numbers called the Pascal’ s Triangle:
Sum of numbers
1                                            1                                                   1
4         6          4        1
5        10
What can you conjecture about the sum of the numbers in Lines 7 and 8? What
about the sum of the numbers in Line 21? Do you see a pattern? Make a guess about
a formula for the sum of the numbers in line n.
Solution : Sum of the numbers in Line 7 = 2 × 32 = 64 = 26
Sum of the numbers in Line 8 = 2 × 64 = 128 = 27
Sum of the numbers in Line 21 = 220
Sum of the numbers in Line n = 2n –1
Example 6 : Consider the so-called triangular numbers Tn:
Fig. A1.1
The dots here are arranged in such a way that they form a triangle. Here T1 = 1,
T2 = 3, T3 = 6, T4 = 10, and so on. Can you guess what T5 is? What about T6? What
about Tn?

It might help if you redraw them in the following way.

Solution : T5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = 5
 T6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 = 6
 Tn =
A favourite example of a conjecture that has been open (that is, it has not been
proved to be true or false) is the Goldbach conjecture named after the mathematician
Christian Goldbach (1690 – 1764).  This conjecture states that “ev ery  ev en integer
greater than 4 can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.”   Perhaps you will
prove that this result is either true or false, and will become famous!
You might have wondered –  do we need to prove everything we encounter in
mathematics, and if not, why not?
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
The fact is that every area in mathematics is based on some statements which are
assumed to be true and are not proved. These are ‘ self-evident truths’  which we take
to be true without proof. These statements are called axioms. In Chapter 5, you would
have studied the axioms and postulates of Euclid. (We do not distinguish between
axioms and postulates these days.)
For example, the first postulate of Euclid states:
A  straight line may be drawn from any point to any other point.
And the third postulate states:
A  circle may be drawn with any centre and any radius.
These statements appear to be perfectly true and Euclid assumed them to be true.
Why? This is because we cannot prove everything and we need to start somewhere.
We need some statements which we accept as true and then we can build up our
knowledge using the rules of logic based on these axioms.
You might then wonder why we don’ t just accept all statements to be true when
they appear self-evident. There are many reasons for this. Very often our intuition can
be wrong, pictures or patterns can deceive and the only way to be sure that something
is true is to prove it.  For example, many of us believe that if a number is multiplied by
another, the result will be larger then both the numbers. But we know that this is not
always true: for example, 5 × 0.2 = 1, which is less than 5.
Also, look at the Fig. A1.3. Which line segment is longer, AB or CD?
Fig. A1.3
It turns out that both are of exactly the same length, even though AB appears
shorter!
You might wonder then, about the validity of axioms. Axioms have been chosen
based on our intuition and what appears to be self-evident. Therefore, we expect them
to be true. However, it is possible that later on we discover that a particular axiom is
not true. What is a safeguard against this possibility? We take the following steps:
Keep the axioms to the bare minimum. For instance, based on only axioms
and five postulates of Euclid, we can derive hundreds of theorems.
L i n e  s e g m e n t  A B
L i n e  s e g m e n t  C D
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
(ii) Make sure the axioms are consistent.
We say a collection of axioms is inconsistent, if we can use one axiom to
show that another axiom is not true. For example, consider the following two
statements. We will show that they are inconsistent.
Statement1: No whole number is equal to its successor.
Statement 2: A whole number divided by zero is a whole number.
(Remember, division by zero is not defined. But just for the moment, we
assume that it is possible, and see what happens.)
From Statement 2, we get 1
0  =  a , where a is some whole number. This
implies that, 1 = 0. But this disproves Statement 1, which states that no whole
number is equal to its successor.
(iii) A false axiom will, sooner or later, result in a contradiction. We say that there
is a contradiction, when we find a statement such that, both the statement
and its negation are true. For example, consider Statement 1 and Statement
2 above once again.
From Statement 1, we can derive the result that 2
Now look at x2 – x 2. We will factorise it in two different ways as follows:
(i) x2 –  x2 = x(x –  x) and
(ii) x2 –  x2 = (x + x)(x –  x)
So, x(x –  x) = (x + x)(x –  x).
From Statement 2, we can cancel (x –  x) from both sides.
We get x = 2x, which in turn implies 2 = 1.
So we have both the statement 2
  1 and its negation, 2 = 1, true. This is a
contradiction. The contradiction arose because of the false axiom, that a whole number
divided by zero is a whole number.
So, the statements we choose as axioms require a lot of thought and insight. We
must make sure they do not lead to inconsistencies or logical contradictions.  Moreover,
the choice of axioms themselves, sometimes leads us to new discoveries. From Chapter
5, you are familiar with Euclid’ s fifth postulate and the discoveries of non-Euclidean
geometries. You saw that mathematicians believed that the fifth postulate need not be
a postulate and is actually a theorem that can be proved using just the first four
postulates. Amazingly these attempts led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries.
We end the section by recalling the differences between an axiom, a theorem and
a conjecture. An axiom is a mathematical statement which is assumed to be true
MATHEMATICS

without proof; a conjecture is a mathematical statement whose truth or falsity is yet
to be established; and a theorem is a mathematical statement whose truth has been
logically established.

2 × 4 × 6 = 48, 4 × 6 ×  8 = 192, and so on. Make three conjectures about these products.

A1.5 What is a Mathematical Proof?
Let us now look at various aspects of proofs. We start with understanding the difference
between verification and proof. Before you studied proofs in mathematics, you were
mainly asked to verify statements.
For example, you might have been asked to verify with examples that “ the product
of two even numbers is even” . So you might have picked up two random even numbers,
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
say 24 and 2006, and checked that 24 × 2006 = 48144 is even. You might have done so
for many more examples.
Also, you might have been asked as an activity to draw several triangles in the
class and compute the sum of their interior angles. Apart from errors due to
measurement, you would have found that the interior angles of a triangle add up to
180°.
What is the flaw in this method? There are several problems with the process of
verification.  While it may help you to make a statement you believe is true, you cannot
be sure that it is true in all cases. For example, the multiplication of several pairs of
even numbers may lead us to guess that the product of two even numbers is even.
However, it does not ensure that the product of all pairs of even numbers is even. You
cannot physically check the products of all possible pairs of even numbers. If you did,
then like the girl in the cartoon, you will be calculating the products of even numbers
for the rest of your life. Similarly, there may be some triangles which you have not yet
drawn whose interior angles do not add up to 180°. We cannot measure the interior
angles of all possible triangles.

Moreover, verification can often be misleading. For example, we might be tempted
to conclude from Pascal’ s triangle (Q.2 of Exercise A1.3), based on earlier verifications,
that 115 = 15101051. But in fact 115 =161051.
So, you need another approach that does not depend upon verification for some
cases only. There is another approach, namely ‘ proving a statement’ .  A process
which can establish the truth of a mathematical statement based purely on logical
arguments is called a mathematical proof.
In Example 2 of Section A1.2, you saw that to establish that a mathematical
statement is false, it is enough to produce a single counter-example. So while it is not
enough to establish the validity of a mathematical statement by checking or verifying
it for thousands of cases, it is enough to produce one counter-example to disprove a
statement (i.e., to show that something is false). This point is worth emphasising.
To show that a mathematical statement is false, it is enough to find a single
counter-ex am ple.
So, 7 + 5 = 12 is a counter-example to the statement that the sum of two odd
numbers is odd.
Let us now look at the list of basic ingredients in a proof:
To prove a theorem, we should have a rough idea as to how to proceed.
The information already given to us in a theorem (i.e., the hypothesis) has to
be clearly understood and used.
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
For example, in Theorem A1.2, which states that the product of two even
numbers is even, we are given two even natural numbers. So, we should use
their properties. In the Factor Theorem (in Chapter 2), you are given a
polynomial p(x) and are told that p(a) = 0. You have to use this to show that
(x –  a) is a factor of p(x). Similarly, for the converse of the Factor Theorem,
you are given that (x –  a) is a factor of p(x), and you have to use this hypothesis
to prove that p(a) =0.
You can also use constructions during the process of proving a theorem.
For example, to prove that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°, we
draw a line parallel to one of the sides through the vertex opposite to the side,
and use properties of parallel lines.
(iii) A proof is made up of a successive sequence of mathematical statements.
Each statement in a proof is logically deduced from a previous statement in
the proof, or from a theorem proved earlier, or an axiom, or our hypothesis.
(iv) The conclusion of a sequence of mathematically true statements laid out in a
logically correct order should be what we wanted to prove, that is, what the
theorem claims.
To understand these ingredients, we will analyse Theorem A1.1 and its proof. You
have already studied this theorem in Chapter 6. But first, a few comments on proofs in
geometry. We often resort to diagrams to help us prove theorems, and this is very
important. However, each statement in the proof has to be established using only
logic. Very often, we hear students make statements like “ Those two angles are
equal because in the drawing they look equal”  or “ that angle must be 900, because the
two lines look as if they are perpendicular to each other” . Beware of being deceived
by what you see (remember Fig A1.3)! .
So now let us go to Theorem A1.1.
Theorem A1.1 : The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.
Proof : Consider a triangle ABC (see Fig. A1.4).
We have to prove that
  ABC +
  BCA +
  CAB = 180°
Fig A 1.4
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
Construct a line DE parallel to BC passing through A.
DE is parallel to BC and AB is a transversal.
  DAB and
  ABC are alternate angles. Therefore, by Theorem 6.2, Chapter 6,
they are equal, i.e.
  DAB =
  ABC
Similarly,
  CAE =
  ACB
Therefore,
  ABC +
  BAC+
  ACB =
  DAB +
  BAC +
  CAE
  DAB +
  BAC +
  CAE = 180°, since they form a straight angle.
Hence,
  ABC +
  BAC+
  ACB = 180°.
Now, we comment on each step of the proof.
Step 1 : Our theorem is concerned with a property of triangles, so we begin with a
triangle.
Step 2 : This is the key idea – the intuitive leap or understanding of how to proceed so
as to be able to prove the theorem. Very often geometric proofs require a construction.
Steps 3 and 4 : Here we conclude that
  DAE =
  ABC and
  CAE =
  ACB, by
using the fact that DE is parallel to BC (our construction), and the previously proved
Theorem 6.2, which states that if two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal,
then the alternate angles are equal.
Step 5 : Here we use Euclid’ s axiom (see Chapter 5) which states that: “ If equals are
added to equals, the wholes are equal”  to deduce
  ABC +
  BAC+
  ACB =
  DAB +
  BAC +
  CAE.
That is, the sum of the interior angles of the triangle are equal to the sum of the angles
on a straight line.
Step 6 : Here we use the Linear pair axiom of Chapter 6, which states that the angles
on a straight line add up to 180°, to show that
  DAB +
  BAC +
  CAE = 180°.
Step 7 : We use Euclid’ s axiom which states that “ things which are equal to the same
t h i n g  a r e  e q u a l  t o  e a c h  o t h e r ”  t o  c o n c l u d e  t h a t    A B C  +
  B A C  +
  ACB =
  DAB +
  BAC +
  CAE = 180°. Notice that Step 7 is the claim made in
the theorem we set out to prove.
We now prove Theorems A1.2 and 1.3 without analysing them.
Theorem A1.2 : The product of two even natural numbers is even.
Proof :   Let x and y be any two even natural numbers.
We want to prove that xy is even.
PROOFS IN MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
Since x and y are even, they are divisible by 2 and can be expressed in the form
x = 2m, for some natural number m and  y = 2n, for some natural number n.
Then xy = 4 mn. Since 4 mn is divisible by 2, so is xy.
Therefore, xy is even.
 Theorem A1.3 : The product of any  three consecutiv e ev en natural numbers is
divisible by 16.
Proof : Any three consecutive even numbers will be of the form 2n, 2n + 2 and
2n  + 4, for some natural number n . We need to prove that their product
2n(2n + 2)(2n + 4) is divisible by 16.
Now, 2n(2n + 2)(2n + 4) = 2n × 2(n +1) × 2(n + 2)
= 2 × 2 × 2n(n + 1)(n + 2) = 8n(n + 1)(n + 2).
Now we have two cases. Either n is even or odd.  Let us examine each case.
Suppose n is even : Then we can write n = 2m, for some natural number m.
And, then 2n(2n + 2)(2n + 4) = 8n(n + 1)(n + 2) = 16m(2m + 1)(2m + 2).
Therefore, 2n(2n + 2)(2n + 4) is divisible by 16.
Next, suppose n is odd. Then n + 1 is even and we can write n + 1  = 2r, for some
natural number r.
We then have :
2n(2n + 2)(2n + 4) = 8n(n + 1)(n + 2)
= 8(2r –  1) × 2r × (2r + 1)
= 16r(2r –  1)(2r + 1)
Therefore, 2n(2n + 2)(2n + 4) is divisible by 16.
So, in both cases we have shown that the product of any three consecutive even
numbers is divisible by 16.
 We conclude this chapter with a few remarks on the difference between how
mathematicians discover results and how formal rigorous proofs are written down. As
mentioned above, each proof has a key intuitive idea (sometimes more than one).
Intuition is central to a mathematician’ s way of thinking and discovering results. Very
often the proof of a theorem comes to a mathematician all jumbled up. A mathematician
will often experiment with several routes of thought, and logic, and examples, before
she/he can hit upon the correct solution or proof. It is only after the creative phase
subsides that all the arguments are gathered together to form a proper proof.
It is worth mentioning here that the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa
Ramanujan used very high levels of intuition to arrive at many of his statements, which
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–1 (03–01–2006).PM65
he claimed were true. Many of these have turned
out be true and are well known theorems. However,
even to this day mathematicians all over the world
are struggling to prove (or disprove) some of his claims
(conjectures).
EXERCISE A1.4
Find counter-examples to disprove the following statements:
If the corresponding angles in two triangles are equal, then the triangles are
congruent.
(ii) A quadrilateral with all sides equal is a square.
(iii) A quadrilateral with all angles equal is a square.
(iv) For integers a and b,
  = a + b
(v) 2n2 + 11 is a prime for all whole numbers n.
(vi) n2 – n + 41 is a prime for all positive integers n.
Take your favourite proof and analyse it step-by-step along the lines discussed in
Section A1.5 (what is given, what has been proved, what theorems and axioms have
been used, and so on).
Prove that the sum of two odd numbers is even.
Prove that the product of two odd numbers is odd.
Prove that the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by 6.
Prove that infinitely many points lie on the line whose equation is y = 2x.

You must have had a friend who must have told you to think of a number and do
various things to it, and then without knowing your original number, telling you what
number you ended up with. Here are two examples. Examine why they work.
Choose a number. Double it. Add nine. Add your original number. Divide by
three. Add four. Subtract your original number. Your result is seven.
(ii) Write down any three-digit number (for example, 425). Make a six-digit number by
repeating these digits in the same order (425425). Your new number is divisible by
7, 11 and 13.

A1.6 Summary
In this Appendix, you have studied the following points:
1. In mathematics, a statement is only acceptable if it is either always true or always false.
2. To show that a mathematical statement is false, it is enough to find a single counter-
example.
3. Axioms are statements which are assumed to be true without proof.
4. A conjecture is a statement we believe is true based on our mathematical intuition, but
which we are yet to prove.
5. A mathematical statement whose truth has been established (or proved) is called a theorem.
6. The main logical tool in proving mathematical statements is deductive reasoning.
7. A proof is made up of a successive sequence of mathematical statements. Each statement
in a proof is logically deduced from a previouly known statement, or from a theorem proved
earlier, or an axiom, or the hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
A2.1 Introduction
Right from your earlier classes, you have been solving problems related to the
real-world around you. For example, you have solved problems in simple interest using
the formula for finding it.  The formula (or equation) is a relation between the interest
and the other three quantities that are related to it, the principal, the rate of interest and
the period. This formula is an example of a mathematical model. A mathematical
model is a mathematical relation that describes some real-life situation.
Mathematical models are used to solve many real-life situations like:
launching a satellite.
predicting the arrival of the monsoon.
controlling pollution due to vehicles.
reducing traffic jams in big cities.
In this chapter, we will introduce you to the process of constructing mathematical
models, which is called mathematical modelling. In mathematical modelling, we
take a real-world problem and write it as an equivalent mathematical problem. We
then solve the mathematical problem, and interpret its solution in terms of the
real-world problem. After this we see to what extent the solution is valid in the context
of the real-world problem. So, the stages involved in mathematical modelling are
formulation, solution, interpretation and validation.
We will start by looking at the process you undertake when solving word problems,
in Section A2.2.  Here, we will discuss some word problems that are similar to the
ones you have solved in your earlier classes. We will see later that the steps that are
used for solving word problems are some of those used in mathematical modelling
also.
INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
In the next section, that is Section A2.3, we will discuss some simple models.
In Section A2.4, we will discuss the overall process of modelling, its advantages
and some of its limitations.
A2.2 Review of Word Problems
In this section, we will discuss some word problems that are similar to the ones that
you have solved in your earlier classes.  Let us start with a problem on direct variation.
Example 1 : I travelled 432 kilometres on 48 litres of petrol in my car. I have to go by
my car to a place which is 180 km away. How much petrol do I need?
Solution : We will list the steps involved in solving the problem.
Step 1 : Formulation : You know that farther we travel, the more petrol we
require, that is, the amount of petrol we need varies directly with the distance we
travel.
Petrol needed for travelling 432 km = 48 litres
Petrol needed for travelling 180 km = ?
Mathematical Description : Let
x = distance I travel
y = petrol I need
y varies directly with x.
y = kx, where k is a constant.
I can travel 432 kilometres with 48 litres of petrol.
y = 48, x = 432.
Therefore,
Since
y = kx,
therefore,
y = 1
Equation or Formula (1) describes the relationship between the petrol needed and
distance travelled.
Step 2 : Solution : We want to find the petrol we need to travel 180 kilometres;
so, we have to find the value of y when x = 180. Putting x = 180 in  (1), we have
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
y = 180
Step 3 : Interpretation : Since y = 20, we need 20 litres of petrol to travel 180
kilometres.
Did it occur to you that you may not be able to use the formula (1) in all situations?
For example, suppose the 432 kilometres route is through mountains and the 180
kilometres route is through flat plains. The car will use up petrol at a faster rate in the
first route, so we cannot use the same rate for the 180 kilometres route, where the
petrol will be used up at a slower rate. So the formula works if all such conditions that
affect the rate at which petrol is used are the same in both the trips. Or, if there is a
difference in conditions, the effect of the difference on the amount of petrol needed
for the car should be very small. The petrol used will vary directly with the distance
travelled only in such a situation. We assumed this while solving the problem.
Example 2 : Suppose Sudhir has invested Rs 15,000 at 8% simple interest per year.
With the return from the investment, he wants to buy a washing machine that costs
Rs 19,000. For what period should he invest Rs 15,000 so that he has enough money to
buy a washing machine?
Solution : Step 1 : Formulation of the problem : Here, we know the principal and
the rate of interest. The interest is the amount Sudhir needs in addition to 15,000 to buy
the washing machine.  We have to find the number of years.
Mathematical Description : The formula for simple interest is I = P
where
P = Principal,
n = Number of years,
r % = Rate of interest
I = Interest earned
Here,
the principal = Rs 15,000
The money required by Sudhir for buying a washing machine = Rs 19,000
So, the interest to be earned = Rs (19,000 – 15,000)
= Rs 4,000
The number of years for which Rs 15,000 is deposited = n
The interest on Rs 15,000 for n years at the rate of 8% = I
Then,
I = 15000 ×
INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL MODELLING

I = 1200n
gives the relationship between the number of years and interest, if Rs 15000 is invested
at an annual interest rate of 8%.
We have to find the period in which the interest earned is Rs 4000.
Putting I = 4000 in (1), we have
4000 = 1200n
Step 2 : Solution of the problem : Solving Equation (2), we get
n = 4000
Step 3 : Interpretation : Since n =
33  and one third of a year is 4 months,
Sudhir can buy a washing machine after 3 years and 4 months.
Can you guess the assumptions that you have to make in the example above? We
have to assume that the interest rate remains the same for the period for which we
calculate the interest. Otherwise, the formula I = P
nr  will not be valid. We have also
assumed that the price of the washing machine does not increase by the time Sudhir
has gathered the money.
Example 3 : A motorboat goes upstream on a river and covers the distance between
two towns on the riverbank in six hours. It covers this distance downstream in five
hours. If the speed of the stream is 2 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.
Solution : Step 1 : Formulation : We know the speed of the river and the time taken
to cover the distance between two places.  We have to find the speed of the boat in
still water.
Mathematical Description : Let us write x for the speed of the boat, t for the time
taken and y for the distance travelled.  Then
y = tx
Let d be the distance between the two places.
While going upstream, the actual speed of the boat
= speed of the boat – speed of the river,
because the boat is travelling against the flow of the river.
So, the speed of the boat upstream = (x – 2) km/h
It takes 6 hours to cover the distance between the towns upstream. So, from (1),
we get
d = 6(x – 2)
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
When going downstream, the speed of the river has to be added to the speed of the
boat.
So, the speed of the boat downstream = (x + 2) km/h
The boat takes 5 hours to cover the same distance downstream.  So,
d = 5(x + 2)
From (2) and (3), we have
5(x + 2) = 6(x –2 )
Step 2 : Finding the Solution
Solving for x in Equation (4), we get x = 22.
Step 3 : Interpretation
Since x = 22, therefore the speed of the motorboat in still water is 22 km/h.
In the example above, we know that the speed of the river is not the same
everywhere. It flows slowly near the shore and faster at the middle. The boat starts at
the shore and moves to the middle of the river. When it is close to the destination, it will
slow down and move closer to the shore. So, there is a small difference between the
speed of the boat at the middle and the speed at the shore. Since it will be close to the
shore for a small amount of time, this difference in speed of the river will affect the
speed only for a small period. So, we can ignore this difference in the speed of the
river. We can also ignore the small variations in speed of the boat. Also, apart from the
speed of the river, the friction between the water and surface of the boat will also
affect the actual speed of the boat. We also assume that this effect is very small.
So, we have assumed that
1. The speed of the river and the boat remains constant all the time.
2. The effect of friction between the boat and water and the friction due to air is
negligible.
We have found the speed of the boat in still water with the assumptions
(hypotheses) above.
As we have seen in the word problems above, there are 3 steps in solving a
word problem. These are
Formulation : We analyse the problem and see which factors have a major
influence on the solution to the problem. These are the relevant factors.  In
our first example, the relevant factors are the distance travelled and petrol
consumed. We ignored the other factors like the nature of the route, driving
speed, etc. Otherwise, the problem would have been more difficult to solve.
The factors that we ignore are the irrelevant factors.
INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
We then describe the problem mathematically, in the form of one or more
mathematical equations.
Solution : We find the solution  of the problem by solving the mathematical
equations obtained in Step 1 using some suitable method.
Interpretation : We see what the solution obtained in Step 2 means in the
context of the original word problem.
Here are some exercises for you. You may like to check your understanding of
the steps involved in solving word problems by carrying out the three steps above for
the following problems.
EXERCISE A 2.1
In each of the following problems, clearly state what the relevant and irrelevant factors are
while going through Steps 1, 2 and 3 given above.
Suppose a company needs a computer for some period of time.  The company can
either hire a computer for Rs 2,000 per month or buy one for Rs 25,000.  If the company
has to use the computer for a long period, the company will pay such a high rent, that
buying a computer will be cheaper. On the other hand, if the company has to use the
computer for say, just one month, then hiring a computer will be cheaper. Find the
number of months beyond which it will be cheaper to buy a computer.
Suppose a car starts from a place A and travels at a speed of 40 km/h towards another
place B.  At the same instance, another car starts from B and travels towards A at a
speed of 30 km/h.  If the distance between A and B is 100 km, after how much time will
the cars meet?
The moon is about 3,84,000 km from the earth, and its path around the earth is nearly
circular. Find the speed at which it orbits the earth, assuming that it orbits the earth in
24 hours. (Use
✁= 3.14)
A family pays Rs 1000 for electricity on an average in those months in which it does
not use a water heater.  In the months in which it uses a water heater, the average
electricity bill is Rs 1240. The cost of using the water heater is Rs 8.00 per hour. Find
the average number of hours the water heater is used in a day.
A2.3 Some Mathematical Models
So far, nothing was new in our discussion. In this section, we are going to add another
step to the three steps that we have discussed earlier. This step is called validation.
What does validation mean? Let us see. In a real-life situation, we cannot accept a
model that gives us  an answer that does not match the reality. This process of checking
the answer against reality, and modifying the mathematical description if necessary, is
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
called validation.  This is a very important step in modelling. We will introduce you to
this step in this section.
First, let us look at an example, where we do not have to modify our model after
validation.
Example 4 :  Suppose you have a room of length 6 m and breadth 5 m. You want to
cover the floor of the room with square mosaic tiles of side 30 cm.  How many tiles
will you need? Solve this by constructing a mathematical model.
Solution : Formulation : We have to consider the area of the room and the area of
a tile for solving the problem. The side of the tile is 0.3 m. Since the length is 6 m, we
can  fit in 6
0.3  = 20 tiles along the length of the room in one row (see Fig. A2.1.).
Fig. A2.1
Since the breadth of the room is 5 metres, we have 5
0.3  = 16.67.  So, we can fit in
16 tiles in a column.  Since 16 × 0.3 = 4.8, 5 – 4.8 = 0.2 metres along the breadth will
not be covered by tiles. This part will have to be covered by cutting the other tiles. The
breadth of the floor left uncovered, 0.2 metres, is more than half the length of a tile,
which is 0.3 m. So we cannot break a tile into two equal halves and use both the halves
to cover the remaining portion.
Mathematical Description :  We have:
Total number of tiles required = (Number of tiles along the length
× Number of tiles along the breadth) + Number of tiles along the uncovered area
Area covered by
full tiles
4.8 m
INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
Solution : As we said above, the number of tiles along the length is 20 and the
number of tiles along the breadth is 16. We need 20 more tiles for the last row. Substituting
these values in (1), we get (20
× 16) + 20 = 320 + 20 = 340.
Interpretation : We need 340 tiles to cover the floor.
Validation : In real-life, your mason may ask you to buy some extra tiles to
replace those that get damaged while cutting them to size. This number will of course
depend upon the skill of your mason! But, we need not modify Equation (1) for this.
This gives you a rough idea of the number of tiles required. So, we can stop here.
Let us now look at another situation now.
Example 5 : In the year 2000, 191 member countries of the U.N. signed a declaration.
In this declaration, the countries agreed to achieve certain development goals by the
year 2015.  These are called the millennium development goals. One of these goals
is to promote gender equality. One indicator for deciding whether this goal has been
achieved is the ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education.
India, as a signatory to the declaration, is committed to improve this ratio. The data for
the percentage of girls who are enrolled in primary schools is given in Table A2.1.

Using this data, mathematically describe the rate at which the proportion of girls enrolled
in primary schools grew. Also, estimate the year by which the enrolment of girls will
reach 50%.
Solution : Let us first convert the problem into a mathematical problem.
Step 1 : Formulation : Table A2.1 gives the enrolment for the years 1991-92,
1992-93, etc.  Since the students join at the beginning of an academic year, we can
take the years as 1991, 1992, etc. Let us assume that the percentage of girls who join
primary schools will continue to grow at the same rate as the rate in Table A2.1. So,
the number of years is important, not the specific years. (To give a similar situation,
when we find the simple interest for, say, Rs 1500 at the rate of 8% for three years, it
does not matter whether the three-year period is from 1999 to 2002 or from 2001 to
2004. What is important is the interest rate in the years being considered).  Here also,
we will see how the enrolment grows after 1991 by comparing the number of years
that has passed after 1991 and the enrolment.  Let us take 1991 as the 0th year, and
write 1 for 1992 since 1 year has passed in 1992 after 1991.  Similarly, we will write 2
for 1993, 3 for 1994, etc. So, Table A2.1 will now look like as Table A2.2.
Table A2.2
Enrolment

The increase in enrolment is given in the following table :
Table A2.3
Enrolment
Increase
(in %)
At the end of the one-year period from 1991 to 1992, the enrolment has increased
by 0.7% from 41.9% to 42.6%. At the end of the second year, this has increased by
0.1%, from 42.6% to 42.7%. From the table above, we cannot find a definite relationship
between the number of years and percentage. But the increase is fairly steady. Only
in the first year and in the 10th year there is a jump. The mean of the values is
          = 0.22
Let us assume that the enrolment steadily increases at the rate of 0.22 per cent.
Mathematical Description : We have assumed that the enrolment increases
steadily at the rate of 0.22% per year.
So, the Enrolment Percentage (EP) in the first year = 41.9 + 0.22
EP in the second year = 41.9 + 0.22 + 0.22 = 41.9 + 2 × 0.22
EP in the third year = 41.9 + 0.22 + 0.22 + 0.22 = 41.9 + 3 × 0.22
So, the enrolment percentage in the nth year = 41.9 + 0.22n, for n > 1.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
Now, we also have to find the number of years by which the enrolment will reach
50%. So, we have to find the value of n in the equation or formula
50 = 41.9 + 0.22n
Step 2 : Solution : Solving (2) for n, we get
n = 50 – 41.9
  Step 3 : Interpretation : Since the number of years is an integral value, we will
take the next higher integer, 37.  So, the enrolment percentage will reach 50% in
1991 + 37 = 2028.
In a word problem, we generally stop here. But, since we are dealing with a real-
life situation, we have to see to what extent this value matches the real situation.
Step 4 : Validation: Let us check if Formula (2) is in agreement with the reality.
Let us find the values for the years we already know, using Formula (2), and compare
it with the known values by finding the difference. The values are given in Table A2.4.

43.44

43.88

44.10
As you can see, some of the values given by Formula (2) are less than the actual
values by about 0.3% or even by 0.5%. This can give rise to a difference of about 3 to
5 years since the increase per year is actually 1% to 2%. We may decide that this
INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
much of a difference is acceptable and stop here. In this case, (2) is our mathematical
model.
Suppose we decide that this error is quite large, and we have to improve this
model.  Then we have to go back to Step 1, the formulation, and change Equation (2).
Let us do so.
Step 1 : Reformulation : We still assume that the values increase steadily by
0.22%, but we will now introduce a correction factor to reduce the error. For this, we
find the mean of all the errors. This is
0.06 – 0.06 – 0.18
         = 0.18
We take the mean of the errors, and correct our formula by this value.
Revised Mathematical Description : Let us now add the mean of the errors to
our formula for enrolment percentage given in (2). So, our corrected formula is:
Enrolment percentage in the nth year = 41.9 + 0.22n + 0.18 = 42.08 + 0.22n, for
n > 1
We will also modify Equation (2) appropriately. The new equation for n is:
50 = 42.08 + 0.22n
Step 2 : Altered Solution : Solving Equation (4) for n, we get
n = 50 – 42.08
Step 3 : Interpretation: Since n = 36, the enrolment of girls in primary schools
will reach 50% in the year 1991 + 36 = 2027.
Step 4 : Validation: Once again, let us compare the values got by using Formula
(4) with the actual values. Table A2.5 gives the comparison.

As you can see, many of the values that (4) gives are closer to the actual value
than the values that (2) gives. The mean of the errors is 0 in this case.
We will stop our process here. So, Equation (4) is our mathematical description
that gives a mathematical relationship between years and the percentage of enrolment
of girls of the total enrolment. We have constructed a mathematical model that describes
the growth.
The process that we have followed in the situation above is called
mathematical modelling.
We have tried to construct a mathematical model with the mathematical tools that
we already have. There are better mathematical tools for making predictions from the
data we have. But, they are beyond the scope of this course. Our aim in constructing
this model is to explain the process of modelling to you, not to make accurate predictions
at this stage.
You may now like to model some real-life situations to check your understanding
of our discussion so far. Here is an Exercise for you to try.

A2.4 The Process of Modelling, its Advantages and Limitations
Let us now conclude our discussion by drawing out aspects of mathematical modelling
that show up in the examples we have discussed. With the background of the earlier
sections, we are now in a position to give a brief overview of the steps involved in
modelling.
Step 1 : Formulation : You would have noticed the difference between the
formulation part of Example 1 in Section A2.2 and the formulation part of the model
we discussed in A2.3. In Example 1, all the information is in a readily usable form. But,
in the model given in A2.3 this is not so. Further, it took us some time to find a
mathematical description. We tested our first formula, but found that it was not as
good as the second one we got. This is usually true in general, i.e. when trying to
model real-life situations; the first model usually needs to be revised. When we are
solving a real-life problem, formulation can require a lot of time. For example, Newton’s
three laws of motion, which are mathematical descriptions of motion, are simple enough
to state. But, Newton arrived at these laws after studying a large amount of data and
the work the scientists before him had done.
MATHEMATICS
File Name : C:\Computer Station\Maths-IX\Chapter\Appendix\Appendix–2 (03–01–2006) PM65
Formulation involves the following three steps :
Stating the problem : Often, the problem is stated vaguely. For example,
the broad goal is to ensure that the enrolment of boys and girls are equal. This
may mean that 50% of the total number of boys of the school-going age and
50% of the girls of the school-going age should be enrolled.  The other way is
to ensure that 50% of the school-going children are girls.  In our problem, we
have used the second approach.
(ii) Identifying relevant factors : Decide which quantities and relationships
are important for our problem and which are unimportant and can be neglected.
For example, in our problem regarding primary schools enrolment, the
percentage of girls enrolled in the previous year can influence the number of
girls enrolled this year.  This is because, as more and more girls enrol in
schools, many more parents will feel they also have to put their daughters in
schools. But, we have ignored this factor because this may become important
only after the enrolment crosses a certain percentage.  Also, adding this factor
may make our model more complicated.
(iii) Mathematical Description : Now suppose we are clear about what the
problem is and what aspects of it are more relevant than the others. Then we
have to find a relationship between the aspects involved in the form of an
equation, a graph or any other suitable mathematical description. If it is an
equation, then every important aspect should be represented by a variable in
our mathematical equation.
Step 2 : Finding the solution : The mathematical formulation does not give the
solution. We have to solve this mathematical equivalent of the problem. This is where
your mathematical knowledge comes in useful.
Step 3 : Interpretating the solution : The mathematical solution is some value
or values of the variables in the model. We have to go back to the real-life problem and
see what these values mean in the problem.
Step 4 : Validating the solution : As we saw in A2.3, after finding the solution
we will have to check whether the solution matches the reality. If it matches, then the
mathematical model is acceptable. If the mathematical solution does not match, we go
back to the formulation step again and try to improve our model.
This step in the process is one major difference between solving word problems
and mathematical modelling. This is one of the most important step in modelling that is
missing in word problems. Of course, it is possible that in some real-life situations, we
do not need to validate our answer because the problem is simple and we get the
correct solution right away. This was so in the first model we considered in A2.3.

We have given a summary of the order in which the steps in mathematical modelling
are carried out in Fig. A2.2 below.  Movement from the validation step to the formulation
step is shown using a dotted arrow. This is because it may not be necessary to carry
out this step again.
Fig.A2.2
Now that you have studied the stages involved in mathematical modelling, let us
discuss some of its aspects.
The aim of mathematical modelling is to get some useful information about a real-
world problem by converting it into a mathematical problem. This is especially useful
when it is not possible or very expensive to get information by other means such as
direct observation or by conducting experiments.
You may also wonder why we should undertake mathematical modelling? Let us
look at some advantages of modelling. Suppose we want to study the corrosive
effect of the discharge of the Mathura refinery on the Taj Mahal. We would not like to
carry out experiments on the Taj Mahal directly since it may not be safe to do so. Of
course, we can use a scaled down physical model, but we may need special facilities
for this, which may be expensive. Here is where mathematical modelling can be of
great use.
Again, suppose we want to know how many primary schools we will need after 5
years. Then, we can only solve this problem by using a mathematical model. Similarly,
it is only through modelling that scientists have been able to explain the existence of so
many phenomena.
You saw in Section A2.3, that we could have tried to improve the answer in the
second example with better methods. But we stopped because we do not have the
mathematical tools.  This can happen in real-life also. Often, we have to be satisfied
with very approximate answers, because mathematical tools are not available.  For
example, the model equations used in modelling weather are so complex that
mathematical tools to find exact solutions are not available.

You may wonder to what extent we should try to improve our model. Usually, to
improve it, we need to take into account more factors. When we do this, we add more
variables to our mathematical equations. We may then have a very complicated model
that is difficult to use. A model must be simple enough to use. A good model balances
two factors:
Accuracy i.e., how close it is to reality.
Ease of use.
For example, Newton’s laws of motion are very simple, but powerful enough to
model many physical situations.
So, is mathematical modelling the answer to all our problems? Not quite! It has its
limitations.
Thus, we should keep in mind that a model is only a simplification of a real-
world problem, and the two are not the same. It is something like the difference
between a map that gives the physical features of a country, and the country itself. We
can find the height of a place above the sea level from this map, but we cannot find the
characteristics of the people from it. So, we should use a model only for the purpose it
is supposed to serve, remembering all the factors we have neglected while constructing
it. We should apply the model only within the limits where it is applicable. In the later
classes, we shall discuss this aspect a little more.
EXERCISE A2.3
How are the solving of word problems that you come across in textbooks different
from the process of mathematical modelling?

roads. Which of these factors are important and which are not?
Price of petrol.
(ii) The rate at which the vehicles arrive in the four different roads.
(iii) The proportion of slow-moving vehicles like cycles and rickshaws and fast moving
vehicles like cars and motorcycles.
