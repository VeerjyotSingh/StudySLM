Beehive, a textbook in English for Class IX, is based on the new syllabus in
English which was prepared as a follow-up to the National Curriculum
Framework, 2005. The curriculum calls for an approach that is rich in
comprehensible input and adopts a language-across-the-curriculum,
multilingual perspective. This reader aims at helping the child to read for
meaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and
accuracy.
Care has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process
of teaching and learning. Learner-friendly language has been used in
the instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the
child. In this process the teacher is a facilitator or a co-learner.
A rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,
cultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from
childhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to
music, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.
The range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and
cognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres
such as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour;
travelogue; and the one-act play.
The number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this
great source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and
understand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include
different types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous
poem.
The poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms
of language and thought. We need not talk about the poet or the
background to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it.  Nor
should we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should
encourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities. They
should be guided to apprehend the poem through the visual, the auditory,
the tactile, the intellectual, or the emotional channels, and to understand
the suggestiveness of the images.
An attempt has been made to help the learner develop the skill of
predicting and anticipating what follows. Every good reader should guess
what is coming next. The task ‘Before You Read’ given at the beginning
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
of each unit is designed for this purpose. Learners should be encouraged
to participate in this activity.
The section ‘Thinking about the Text’ attempts to move from surface
level understanding of the text to critical thinking. The comprehension
exercises given here try to help the learners infer meaning. There are a
few questions which ask for the readers’ judgment; they aim to  bring
out the learners’ deeper understanding of the text.
In the section ‘Thinking about Language’:
• Vocabulary enrichment has been attempted through a variety of
tasks on the usage of words closely related in meaning, matching
words to meanings, word building (including phrasal verbs), and
reference to the dictionary. An activity on the use of the index has
been included.
• Attention has been drawn to grammar-in-context that emerges out of
the reading text, e.g. the use of the tenses and voice, reported speech,
conditional and subordinate clauses or phrases, and adverbs.
The communicative skills have been exercised by tasks on Speaking
and Writing. The Speaking tasks call for learners to work in pairs or
groups, (for example) to present an argument, express a viewpoint,
express contrasts, seek or give an opinion, introduce a speaker, tell a
story, enact or read out a play in parts, etc.
There are a variety of writing tasks: help writing newspaper report, an
article for a school magazine, argumentative writing, narration,
description, and picture interpretation.
A small attempt has been made to relate speech and writing by pointing
out similarities and differences. Opportunities for writing in groups and
pairs are provided to get into the task.
We have introduced the old exercise of dictation again but from a
completely different perspective. Dictation has been introduced in its
current, updated form as a variety of activities designed to integrate the
language skills of listening, prior reading, language processing and recall,
and writing, including the appropriate use of punctuation in meaningful
contexts.
Some exercises also allow scope for the learners’ languages to support
one another’s by asking for reflection on relevant words, or poems or
stories in other languages; and attempt (preliminary as they may be) to
attend to the process of translation. Activities have been suggested to
bring out the relatedness of the learners’ school subjects.

This story takes us to the world of the future where computers will play
a major role. Let the children talk freely about how they imagine the
schools of the future that their own children might go to. You might want
to explain the ideas of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘virtual classroom’. The term
‘virtual reality’ refers to a reality created by computer software, and a
‘virtual classroom’ is not a real classroom but one where learning is
through computer software or the Internet. The children may know what
a robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be.
In this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate.
The following points could be explained before the task.
• A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers
to show skill and ability in arguing.
• A proposition, a question or a problem is required for this purpose,
which can be spoken for or against.
• To participate in a debate, one must prepare for it.  So, one must
prepare an outline of the main points in the order in which one is
going to argue.
• The time limit is about four to five minutes.
• The speaker addresses the audience.
• Every topic/subject has its own vocabulary.  These must be learnt.
• The speaker addresses the chair (Mr President/Madam), ‘submits’
an argument, ‘appeals’ for sympathetic understanding and support,
‘questions’ the opponent’s views, and ‘concludes’ an argument.
✎❖✡☛✍
These biographical pieces tell us of people who have achieved success
and recognition through determination, hard work and courage. The
children may be asked to think of potential barriers to success, and of
people who have overcome them. The second part of the unit encourages
students to think about the rich heritage of Indian music, and our musical
instruments. The portraits of musicians given in the beginning may be
supplemented by others that the children can be asked to bring to class.
A comprehension exercise in Part II encourages children to find words in
the text that express attitudes (positive, negative or neutral) to events,
places, etc. Encourage the children to compare and discuss their answers.
Dictionary entries give us different kinds of information about words. Children
need help in using the dictionary to find specific kinds of information.
Notes for the Teacher / 3
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
This unit has an exercise that asks students to consult a dictionary and
find out which adjective can be used before a noun, which can be used
after a verb, and which can be used in both ways. You may add some
adjectives to those suggested. Encourage the children also to find more
adjectives of the kinds mentioned. Students may wish to consult (in
addition to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary), the Longman
Dictionary of Contemporary English, the Collins Cobuild Advanced Learner’s
English Dictionary, and the Word Master (Orient Longman), or any good
dictionary of their choice.
The Speaking exercise asks the students to imagine introducing a
celebrity guest to an audience. It can be made an authentic activity if
students are given a couple of minutes during the morning assembly to
speak to their fellow-pupils about such a person. This would give them
practice in facing an audience, and encourage them to prepare seriously,
by: (i)  noting down the important points about the person to be
introduced, (ii) using appropriate phrases to introduce the person
(students should be allowed to think what phrases they want to use).
The Writing Task is an exercise in comparison. Hard work is a trait common
to Evelyn Glennie (Part I, para 5) and Bismillah Khan (Part II, para 5).
Help children identify the paragraphs that tell us about the two musicians’
goals. After they read and understand these parts of the text, they can
organise the ideas in two paragraphs, one on each musician.
✸ ✁❍✂
The aim in this unit is to first read through the story at one go, not worrying
about difficult words or difficult language. Students can read the story for
homework and come to class; or the teacher can read out the story in
class; or the students can read out parts of the story in the class, one
after the other. Let them retell the story again, if necessary, in parts.
The dictionary exercise in this unit shows how a very small common
word can be used in different ways. Students might be interested in
thinking about how they use words in their own language to express
these meanings. They may also think of other words like same, small,
give and take to convey different kids of meaning. Encourage them to
consult a dictionary.
This is a story about the changing attitude of a girl child towards her
father. The Speaking and Writing exercises encourage the students to
think about the relationship between children and parents. The students
should be encouraged to say or write what they think, and not what the
teacher thinks they should say or write.  The aim is not to arrive at
a ‘correct’ answer, but to let every child voice an opinion and express
her/his ideas. It is hoped that children will find the topic of personal
relevance. This will help their ideas and language to flow freely.

Have you ever read words on a television (or computer) screen?
Can you imagine a time when all books will be on computers,
and there will be no books printed on paper? Would you like
such books better?
1. MARGIE even wrote about it that night in her diary.
On the page headed 17 May 2157, she wrote, “Today
Tommy found a real book!”
It was a very old book. Margie’s grandfather once
said that when he was a little boy his grandfather

told him that there was a time when all stories
were printed on paper.
They turned the pages, which were yellow and
crinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words
that stood still instead of moving the way they were
supposed to — on a screen, you know. And then
when they turned back to the page before, it had
the same words on it that it had had when they
read it the first time.
“Gee,” said Tommy, “what a waste. When you’re
through with the book, you just throw it away, I
guess. Our television screen must have had a million
books on it and it’s good for plenty more. I wouldn’t
throw it away.”
“Same with mine,” said Margie. She was eleven
and hadn’t seen as many telebooks as Tommy had.
He was thirteen.
She said, “Where did you find it?”
“In my house.” He pointed without looking,
because he was busy reading. “In the attic.”
“What’s it about?”
“School.”
Margie was scornful. “School? What’s there to
write about school? I hate school.”
Margie always hated school, but now she hated
it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been
giving her test after test in geography and she had
been doing worse and worse until her mother had
shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County
Inspector.
He was a round little man with a red face and a
whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled
at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the
teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn’t know
how to put it together again, but he knew how all
right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again,
large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which
all the lessons were shown and the questions were
asked. That wasn’t so bad. The part Margie hated

most was the slot where she had to put homework
and test papers. She always had to write them out
in a punch code they made her learn when she was
six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated
the marks in no time.
The Inspector had smiled after he was finished
and patted Margie’s head. He said to her mother,
“It’s not the little girl’s fault, Mrs Jones. I think the
geography sector was geared a little too quick. Those
things happen sometimes. I’ve slowed it up to an
average ten-year level. Actually, the overall pattern
of her progress is quite satisfactory.” And he patted
Margie’s head again.
Margie was disappointed. She had been hoping
they would take the teacher away altogether. They
had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a
month because the history sector had blanked out
completely.
So she said to Tommy, “Why would anyone write
about school?”
Tommy looked at her with very superior eyes.
“Because it’s not our kind of school, stupid. This is
the old kind of school that they had hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.” He added loftily,
pronouncing the word carefully, “Centuries ago.”
Margie was hurt. “Well, I don’t know what
kind of school they had all that time ago.” She read
the book over his shoulder for a while, then said,
“Anyway, they had a teacher.”

“Sure they had a teacher, but it wasn’t a regular
teacher. It was a man.”
“A man? How could a man be a teacher?”
“Well, he just told the boys and girls things and
gave them homework and asked them questions.”
“A man isn’t smart enough.”
“Sure he is. My father knows as much as my
teacher.”
“He knows almost as much, I betcha.”
Margie wasn’t prepared to dispute that. She said,
“I wouldn’t want a strange man in my house to
teach me.”
Tommy screamed with laughter. “You don’t know
much, Margie. The teachers didn’t live in the
house. They had a special building and all the
kids went there.”
“And all the kids learned the same thing?”
“Sure, if they were the same age.”
“But my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted
to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and
that each kid has to be taught differently.”
“Just the same they didn’t do it that way then.
If you don’t like it, you don’t have to read the book.”
“I didn’t say I didn’t like it,” Margie said quickly.
She wanted to read about those funny schools.
They weren’t even half finished when Margie’s
mother called, “Margie! School!”
Margie looked up. “Not yet, Mamma.”
“Now!” said Mrs Jones. “And it’s probably time
for Tommy, too.”
Margie said to Tommy, “Can I read the book some
more with you after school?”
“May be,” he said nonchalantly. He walked away
whistling, the dusty old book tucked beneath
his arm.
Margie went into the schoolroom. It was right
next to her bedroom, and the mechanical teacher
was on and waiting for her. It was always on at the

because her mother said little girls learned better
if they learned at regular hours.
The screen was lit up, and it said: “Today’s
arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper
fractions. Please insert yesterday’s homework in the
proper slot.”
Margie did so with a sigh. She was thinking about
the old schools they had when her grandfather’s
grandfather was a little boy. All the kids from the
whole neighborhood came, laughing and shouting
in the schoolyard, sitting together in the schoolroom,
going home together at the end of the day. They
learned the same things, so they could help one
another with the homework and talk about it.
And the teachers were people…

This well-known poem is about making choices, and the
choices that shape us. Robert Frost is an American poet who
writes simply, but insightfully, about common, ordinary
experiences.
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveller, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I —
I took the one less travelled by,
And that has made all the difference.

“God may have taken her hearing but he has given her back
something extraordinary. What we hear, she feels — far more
deeply than any of us. That is why she expresses music so
beautifully.”
Read the following account of a person who fought against a
physical disability and made her life a success story.
1. RUSH hour crowds jostle for position on the
underground train platform. A slight girl, looking
younger than her seventeen years, was nervous yet
excited as she felt the vibrations of the approaching
train. It was her first day at the prestigious Royal
Academy of Music in London and daunting enough
for any teenager fresh from a Scottish farm. But
this aspiring musician faced a bigger challenge than
most: she was profoundly deaf.
Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been
gradual. Her mother remembers noticing something
was wrong when the eight-year-old Evelyn was
waiting to play the piano. “They called her name
and she didn’t move. I suddenly realised she hadn’t
heard,” says Isabel Glennie. For quite a while Evelyn
managed to conceal her growing deafness from
friends and teachers. But by the time she was
eleven her marks had deteriorated and her
headmistress urged her parents to take her to a

specialist. It was then discovered that her hearing
was severely impaired as a result of gradual nerve
damage. They were advised that she should be fitted
with hearing aids and sent to a school for the deaf.
“Everything suddenly looked black,” says Evelyn.
But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was
determined to lead a normal life and pursue her
interest in music. One day she noticed a girl playing
a xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it
too. Most of the teachers discouraged her but
percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her potential. He
began by tuning two large drums to different notes.
“Don’t listen through your ears,” he would say, “try
to sense it some other way.” Says Evelyn, “Suddenly
I realised I could feel the higher drum from the
waist up and the lower one from the waist down.”
Forbes repeated the exercise, and soon Evelyn
discovered that she could sense certain notes in
different parts of her body. “I had learnt to open my
mind and body to sounds and vibrations.” The rest
was sheer determination and hard work.
She never looked back from that point onwards.
She toured the United Kingdom with a youth
orchestra and by the time she was sixteen, she had
decided to make music her life. She auditioned for
the Royal Academy of Music and scored one of the
highest marks in the history of the academy. She
gradually moved from orchestral work to solo
performances. At the end of her three-year course,
she had captured most of the top awards.
And for all this, Evelyn won’t accept any hint of
heroic achievement. “If you work hard and know
where you are going, you’ll get there.” And she got
right to the top, the world’s most sought-after multi-
percussionist with a mastery of some thousand
instruments, and hectic international schedule.
It is intriguing to watch Evelyn function so
effortlessly without hearing. In our two-hour
discussion she never missed a word. “Men with
bushy beards give me trouble,” she laughed. “It is

not just watching the lips, it’s the whole face,
especially the eyes.” She speaks flawlessly with a
Scottish lilt. “My speech is clear because I could
hear till I was eleven,” she says. But that doesn’t
explain how she managed to learn French and
master basic Japanese.
As for music, she explains, “It pours in through
every part of my body. It tingles in the skin, my
cheekbones and even in my hair.” When she plays
the xylophone, she can sense the sound passing up
the stick into her fingertips. By leaning against the
drums, she can feel the resonances flowing into her
body. On a wooden platform she removes her shoes
so that the vibrations pass through her bare feet
and up her legs.

Not surprisingly, Evelyn delights her audiences.
In 1991 she was presented with the Royal
Philharmonic Society’s prestigious Soloist of the Year
Award. Says master percussionist James Blades,
“God may have taken her hearing but he has given
her back something extraordinary. What we hear,
she feels — far more deeply than any of us. That is
why she expresses music so beautifully.”
Evelyn confesses that she is something of a
workaholic. “I’ve just got to work ... often harder
than classical musicians. But the rewards are
enormous.” Apart from the regular concerts, Evelyn
also gives free concerts in prisons and hospitals.
She also gives high priority to classes for young
musicians. Ann Richlin of the Beethoven Fund for
Deaf Children says, “She is a shining inspiration
for deaf children. They see that there is nowhere
that they cannot go.”
Evelyn Glennie has already accomplished more
than most people twice her age. She has brought
percussion to the front of the orchestra, and
demonstrated that it can be very moving. She has
given inspiration to those who are handicapped,
people who look to her and say, ‘If she can do it, I
can.’ And, not the least, she has given enormous
pleasure to millions.

Do you know these people? What instruments do they play?
Think of the shehnai and the first thing you’ll probably imagine
is a wedding or a similar occasion or function. The next would
probably be Ustad Bismillah Khan, the shehnai maestro,
playing this instrument.
1. EMPEROR Aurangzeb banned the playing of a musical
instrument called pungi in the royal residence for
it had a shrill unpleasant sound. Pungi became the
generic name for reeded noisemakers. Few had
thought that it would one day be revived. A barber
of a family of professional musicians, who had access
to the royal palace, decided to improve the tonal
quality of the pungi. He chose a pipe with a natural
hollow stem that was longer and broader than the
pungi, and made seven holes on the body of the
pipe. When he played on it, closing and opening
some of these holes, soft and melodious sounds were

produced. He played the instrument before royalty
and everyone was impressed. The instrument so
different from the pungi had to be given a new name.
As the story goes, since it was first played in the
Shah’s chambers and was played by a nai (barber),
the instrument was named the ‘shehnai’.
The sound of the shehnai began to be considered
auspicious. And for this reason it is still played in
temples and is an indispensable component of any
North Indian wedding. In the past, the shehnai was
part of the naubat or traditional ensemble of nine
instruments found at royal courts. Till recently it
was used only in temples and weddings. The credit
for bringing this instrument onto the classical stage
goes to Ustad Bismillah Khan.
As a five-year old, Bismillah Khan played gilli-
danda near a pond in the ancient estate of Dumraon
in Bihar. He would regularly go to the nearby Bihariji
temple to sing the Bhojpuri ‘Chaita’, at the end of
which he would earn a big laddu weighing 1.25 kg,
a prize given by the local Maharaja. This happened
80 years ago, and the little boy has travelled far to
earn the highest civilian award in India — the
Bharat Ratna.
Born on 21 March 1916, Bismillah belongs to a
well-known family of musicians from Bihar. His
grandfather, Rasool Bux Khan, was the shehnai-
nawaz of the Bhojpur king’s court. His father,
Paigambar Bux, and other paternal ancestors were
also great shehnai players.

The young boy took to music early in life. At the
age of three when his mother took him to his maternal
uncle’s house in Benaras (now Varanasi), Bismillah
was fascinated watching his uncles practise the
shehnai. Soon Bismillah started accompanying his
uncle, Ali Bux, to the Vishnu temple of Benaras where
Bux was employed to play the shehnai. Ali Bux would
play the shehnai and Bismillah would sit captivated
for hours on end. Slowly, he started getting lessons
in playing the instrument and would sit practising
throughout the day. For years to come the temple of
Balaji and Mangala Maiya and the banks of the Ganga
became the young apprentice’s favourite haunts where
he could practise in solitude. The flowing waters of
the Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent raagas
that were earlier considered to be beyond the range
of the shehnai.
At the age of 14, Bismillah accompanied his
uncle to the Allahabad Music Conference. At the
end of his recital, Ustad Faiyaz Khan patted the
young boy’s back and said, “Work hard and you shall
make it.” With the opening of the All India Radio in
Lucknow in 1938 came Bismillah’s big break. He
soon became an often-heard shehnai player on radio.
When India gained independence on 15 August
1947, Bismillah Khan became the first Indian to
greet the nation with his shehnai. He poured his
heart out into Raag Kafi from the Red Fort to an
audience which included Mahatma Gandhi and
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who later gave his famous
‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech.
Bismillah Khan has given many memorable
performances both in India and abroad. His first
trip abroad was to Afghanistan where King Zahir
Shah was so taken in by the maestro that he gifted
him priceless Persian carpets and other souvenirs.
The King of Afghanistan was not the only one to be
fascinated with Bismillah’s music. Film director
Vijay Bhatt was so impressed after hearing
Bismillah play at a festival that he named a film

after the instrument called Gunj Uthi Shehnai. The
film was a hit, and one of Bismillah Khan’s
compositions, “Dil ka khilona hai toot gaya ...,” turned
out to be a nationwide chartbuster! Despite this
huge success in the celluloid world, Bismillah
Khan’s ventures in film music were limited to two:
Vijay Bhatt’s Gunj Uthi Shehnai and Vikram
Srinivas’s Kannada venture, Sanadhi Apanna. “I just
can’t come to terms with the artificiality and
glamour of the film world,” he says with emphasis.
Awards and recognition came thick and fast.
Bismillah Khan became the first Indian to be invited
to perform at the prestigious Lincoln Centre Hall in
the United States of America. He also took part in
the World Exposition in Montreal, in the Cannes
Art Festival and in the Osaka Trade Fair. So well
known did he become internationally that an
auditorium in Teheran was named after him —
Tahar Mosiquee Ustaad Bismillah Khan.
National awards like the Padmashri, the Padma
Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan were
conferred on him.
In 2001, Ustad Bismillah Khan was awarded
India’s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.
With the coveted award resting on his chest and
his eyes glinting with rare happiness he said, “All I
would like to say is: Teach your children music,
this is Hindustan’s richest tradition; even the West
is now coming to learn our music.’’
In spite of having travelled all over the world —
Khansaab as he is fondly called — is exceedingly
fond of Benaras and Dumraon and they remain for
him the most wonderful towns of the world. A
student of his once wanted him to head a shehnai
school in the U.S.A., and the student promised to
recreate the atmosphere of Benaras by replicating
the temples there. But Khansaab asked him if he
would be able to transport River Ganga as well.
Later he is remembered to have said, “That is why

have been asked to introduce her to the audience before her performance. How
would you introduce her?
Here is some information about Kishori Amonkar you can find on the Internet.
Read the passage and make notes of the main points about:
her parentage
the school of music she belongs to
her achievements
her inspiration
awards
Padma Bhushan Kishori Amonkar, widely considered the finest female
vocalist of her generation, was born in 1931, daughter of another great artist,
Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar. In her early years she absorbed the approach and
repertoire of her distinguished mother’s teacher Ustad Alladiya Khan. As her
own style developed, however, she moved away from Alladiya Khan’s ‘Jaipur-
Atrauli gharana’ style in some respects, and as a mature artist her approach
is usually regarded as an individual, if not unique, variant of the Jaipur
model.
Kishori Amonkar is a thinker, besotted by what she calls the mysterious
world of her raagas. She dissects them with the precision of a perfectionist,
almost like a scientist, until the most subtle of shades and emotions emerge
and re-emerge.
She is very much inspired by the teachings of the ancient Vedic sages,
written at a time when vocal music was highly devotional in character. This

soul searching quality of her music, coupled with a very intellectual approach
to raaga performance has gained her quite a following in India and has helped
to revive the study of khayal.
Significant awards bestowed on this artist include the Sangeet Natak
Akademi Award (1985), the Padma Bhushan (1987), and the highly coveted
Sangeet Samradhini Award (considered one of the most prestigious awards
in Indian Classical Music) in 1997.

How can we make friends with it?

Don’t break the shutters of the windows.
Don’t scatter the papers.
Don’t throw down the books on the shelf.
There, look what you did — you threw them all down.
You tore the pages of the books.
You brought rain again.
You’re very clever at poking fun at weaklings.
Frail crumbling houses, crumbling doors, crumbling rafters,
crumbling wood, crumbling bodies, crumbling lives,

the wind god winnows and crushes them all.
He won’t do what you tell him.
So, come, let’s build strong homes,
Let’s joint the doors firmly.

He makes strong fires roar and flourish.
His friendship is good.
We praise him every day.

Do you feel you know your parents better now, than when
you were much younger? Perhaps you now understand the
reasons for some of their actions that used to upset you earlier.
This story about a little girl whose feelings for her father
change from fear to understanding will probably find an echo
in every home.
1. TO the little girl he was a figure to be feared and
avoided. Every morning before going to work he came
into her room and gave her a casual kiss, to which
she responded with “Goodbye, Father”. And oh,
there was a glad sense of relief when she heard the
noise of the carriage growing fainter and fainter
down the long road!
In the evening when he came home she stood
near the staircase and heard his loud voice in the
hall. “Bring my tea into the drawing-room... Hasn’t
the paper come yet? Mother, go and see if my paper’s
out there — and bring me my slippers.”
“Kezia,” Mother would call to her, “if you’re a
good girl you can come down and take off father’s
boots.” Slowly the girl would slip down the stairs,
more slowly still across the hall, and push open
the drawing-room door.
By that time he had his spectacles on and looked
at her over them in a way that was terrifying to
the little girl.
“Well, Kezia, hurry up and pull off these boots
and take them outside. Have you been a good
girl today?”
“I d-d-don’t know, Father.”

“You d-d-don’t know? If you stutter like that
Mother will have to take you to the doctor.”
She never stuttered with other people — had
quite given it up — but only with Father, because
then she was trying so hard to say the words
properly.
“What’s the matter? What are you looking so
wretched about? Mother, I wish you taught this child
not to appear on the brink of suicide... Here, Kezia,
carry my teacup back to the table carefully.”
He was so big — his hands and his neck,
especially his mouth when he yawned. Thinking
about him alone was like thinking about a giant.
On Sunday afternoons Grandmother sent her
down to the drawing-room to have a “nice talk with
Father and Mother”. But the little girl always found
Mother reading and Father stretched out on the
sofa, his handkerchief on his face, his feet on one
of the best cushions, sleeping soundly and snoring.

She sat on a stool, gravely watched him until he
woke and stretched, and asked the time — then
looked at her.
“Don’t stare so, Kezia. You look like a little
brown owl.”
One day, when she was kept indoors with a cold,
her grandmother told her that father’s birthday was
next week, and suggested she should make him a
pin-cushion for a gift out of a beautiful piece of
yellow silk.
Laboriously, with a double cotton, the little girl
stitched three sides. But what to fill it with? That
was the question. The grandmother was out in the
garden, and she wandered into Mother’s bedroom
to look for scraps. On the bed-table she discovered
a great many sheets of fine paper, gathered them
up, tore them into tiny pieces, and stuffed her case,
then sewed up the fourth side.
That night there was a hue and cry in the house.
Father’s great speech for the Port Authority had
been lost. Rooms were searched; servants
questioned. Finally Mother came into Kezia’s room.
“Kezia, I suppose you didn’t see some papers on
a table in our room?”
“Oh yes,” she said, “I tore them up for my
surprise.”
“What!” screamed Mother. “Come straight down
to the dining-room this instant.”
And she was dragged down to where Father was
pacing to and fro, hands behind his back.
“Well?” he said sharply.
Mother explained.
He stopped and stared at the child.
“Did you do that?”
“N-n-no”, she whispered.
“Mother, go up to her room and fetch down the
damned thing — see that the child’s put to bed
this instant.”

Crying too much to explain, she lay in the
shadowed room watching the evening light make a
sad little pattern on the floor.
Then Father came into the room with a ruler in
his hands.
“I am going to beat you for this,” he said.
“Oh, no, no”, she screamed, hiding under the
bedclothes.
He pulled them aside.
“Sit up,” he ordered, “and hold out your hands.
You must be taught once and for all not to touch
what does not belong to you.”
“But it was for your b-b-birthday.”
Down came the ruler on her little, pink palms.
Hours later, when Grandmother had
wrapped her in a shawl and rocked her in the
rocking-chair, the child clung to her soft body.
“What did God make fathers for?” she sobbed.
“Here’s a clean hanky, darling. Blow your nose.
Go to sleep, pet; you’ll forget all about it in the
morning. I tried to explain to Father but he was too
upset to listen tonight.”
But the child never forgot. Next time she saw
him she quickly put both hands behind her back
and a red colour flew into her cheeks.
The Macdonalds lived next door. They had
five children. Looking through a gap in the fence
the little girl saw them playing ‘tag’ in the
evening. The father with the baby, Mao, on his
shoulders, two little girls hanging on to his coat
pockets ran round and round the flower-beds,
shaking with laughter. Once she saw the boys
turn the hose on him—and he tried to catch them
laughing all the time.
Then it was she decided there were different
sorts of fathers.
Suddenly, one day, Mother became ill, and she
and Grandmother went to hospital.

Father beside her bed, a candle in his hand.

He blew out the candle, bent down and caught up

passage to the big bedroom. A newspaper was on
the bed — a half-smoked cigar was near his reading-
lamp. He put away the paper, threw the cigar into
the fireplace, then carefully tucked up the child.
He lay down beside her. Half asleep still, still with
the butcher’s smile all about her it seemed, she
crept close to him, snuggled her head under his
arm, held tightly to his shirt.
Then the dark did not matter; she lay still.
“Here, rub your feet against my legs and get
them warm,” said Father.
Tired out, he slept before the little girl. A
funny feeling came over her. Poor Father, not so big,
after all — and with no one to look after him. He was
harder than Grandmother, but it was a nice
hardness. And every day he had to work and was too
tired to be a Mr Macdonald… She had torn up all his
beautiful writing… She stirred suddenly, and sighed.
“What’s the matter?” asked her father. “Another
dream?”
“Oh,” said the little girl, “my head’s on your heart.
I can hear it going. What a big heart you’ve got,
Father dear.”

When the humid shadows hover
Over all the starry spheres
And the melancholy darkness
Gently weeps in rainy tears,
What a bliss to press the pillow
Of a cottage-chamber bed
And lie listening to the patter
Of the soft rain overhead!
Every tinkle on the shingles
Has an echo in the heart;
And a thousand dreamy fancies
Into busy being start,
And a thousand recollections
Weave their air-threads into woof,
As I listen to the patter
Of the rain upon the roof.
Now in memory comes my mother,
As she used in years agone,
To regard the darling dreamers
Ere she left them till the dawn:
O! I feel her fond look on me
As I list to this refrain
Which is played upon the shingles
By the patter of the rain.

The story of Einstein tries to show him as a human being, a fairly
ordinary person who had his likes and dislikes, his streaks of rebellion,
and his problems. The class can think about how a ‘great person’ was
perceived before being recognised as ‘great’: it is not as though great
people are born with a special sign that allows us to recognise them
instantly! What qualities in a person, then, make them a genius or a
great person?
You can take the help of a science teacher to explain Einstein’s Theory
of Relativity, to talk about Einstein, and build inter-subject cooperation.
The exercise of matching headings to paragraphs in the lesson is useful
for finding the topic sentence or to scan a paragraph for specific
information. Students may be asked to provide a different heading if
they feel some other point is equally important.
Students should be guided to write a newspaper report. Note the points
given below. Illustrate them by bringing examples from newspapers into
the class, and ask students to bring their own examples.
• A report should have:
A headline
Name of the reporter e.g. ‘By a Staff Reporter’, etc.
Place, date, source (the source may also be given at the end of the
report).
• The beginning is usually an expansion of the headline.  The middle
paragraph gives the details.  It is followed by the conclusion or the
summing up.
• The report should be brief, but the headline and the style should be
eye-catching.
• Sometimes important points are given in a box in the centre of the
report.
• Regarding the language of the reports:
passives for past action (for example: It is found ..., ... has been
unearthed.)

This unit has a passage for dictation, an anecdote. Dictation is an
exercise that requires the individual participation of each student. It
fosters unconscious thinking, and draws attention to language form.
Students can also be given opportunities for self or peer correction after
the dictation.
• Students should first read the passage silently, noticing the use of
punctuation marks.
• The passage to be dictated should be read aloud twice in the class
with proper intonation, and pauses between meaningful phrases.
• The passage is read a third time for students to check through.

‘The Snake and the Mirror’ is a complex story of self-discovery that is
humorously told. The narrator is a vain and foolish young man who in
a moment of crisis realises that he is “poor, foolish and stupid”. The
questions are designed to help the students notice the humour in the
narration.
This unit has a formal, expository passage for dictation. Students should
be encouraged to learn the spellings of unfamiliar words beforehand.
The dictation of such passages also encourages the development of
grammar in the students’ minds, as they recall complex language.
The Writing task is based on a sketch from a photograph that tells a
story. Encourage the students to read the words given alongside the
sketch. Let the students form pairs or groups to talk freely about the
sketch before they start writing.
A new kind of activity introduced in this lesson is to compare two
translations of the beginning of a story. This activity suggests to the
students that language is not ‘fixed’; there are different ways of
experiencing an idea, which also lead to small changes in the idea that
is expressed. This activity should be done as a fun activity.

will develop a critical understanding of how life and society in
the deep south changed and developed over the years. Dhanuskodi
and Rameswaram are on an island, the Pamban Island, off the
Tamil Nadu coast.
The dictionary work encourages children to identify the contexts, literal
and metaphorical, in which the given words occur. You may find other
such words to add to the exercise.
The dictation exercise in this unit requires the rearrangement of jumbled
paragraphs. Ideally this kind of dictation should be carried out with
passages that the students have not seen before.
The teacher dictates the three parts of the given passage, in random
order, one to each group in class, for example part two first, then part
three, and finally part one. The class has to share information in order
to put the text together in the right order. This can be a class activity
directed by the teacher.
The Speaking exercise includes an activity requiring students to ask
other people for their opinion on the topic.

This is a humorous story about the confusion and mess made by
inexperienced packing. Draw the attention of the students to the antics

narration, such as “Montmorency’s ambition in life is to get in the way
and be sworn at,” or the beginning of the narration “Packing is one of
those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person
living.(It surprises me myself, sometimes, how many such things there
are.)”
An activity in this unit is to collect examples of instructions and
directions such as those given in pamphlets for different products. An
example has been provided of a pamphlet with instructions in different
foreign languages. The purpose is to encourage students to find other
such pamphlets as a fun activity.

Who do you think of, when you hear the word ‘genius’? Who
is a genius — what qualities do you think a genius has?
We shall now read about a young German civil servant who
took the world by storm about a hundred years ago. In the
summer of 1905, the 26-year-old published in quick succession
four ground-breaking papers: about light, the motion of
particles, the electrodynamics of moving bodies, and energy.
His work took up only a few pages in scientific journals, but
changed forever our understanding of space, time and the
entire cosmos — and transformed the name ‘Einstein’ into a
synonym for genius.
Fifty years after his death, Albert Einstein’s genius still reigns.
1. ALBERT Einstein was born on 14 March 1879 in the
German city of Ulm, without any indication that he
was destined for greatness.  On the contrary, his
mother thought Albert was a freak. To her, his head
seemed much too large.
At the age of two-and-a-half, Einstein still wasn’t
talking. When he finally did learn to speak, he uttered
everything twice. Einstein did not know what to do
with other children, and his playmates called him
“Brother Boring.” So the youngster played by himself
freak: a word used
disapprovingly to talk
about a person who is
unusual and doesn’t
behave, look or think
like others
Otto Neugebauer, the historian of ancient mathematics, told a
story about the boy Einstein that he characterises as a “legend”,
but that seems fairly authentic. As he was a late talker, his parents
were worried. At last, at the supper table one night, he broke his
silence to say, “The soup is too hot.” Greatly relieved, his parents
asked why he had never said a word before. Albert replied,
“Because up to now everything was in order.”

A Truly Beautiful Mind / 47
much of the time. He especially loved mechanical
toys. Looking at his newborn sister, Maja, he is said
to have said: “Fine, but where are her wheels?”
A headmaster once told his father that what
Einstein chose as a profession wouldn’t matter,
because “he’ll never make a success at anything.”
Einstein began learning to play the violin at the
age of six, because his mother wanted him to; he
later became a gifted amateur violinist, maintaining
this skill throughout his life.
But Albert Einstein was not a bad pupil.  He
went to high school in Munich, where Einstein’s
family had moved when he was 15 months old, and
scored good marks in almost every subject. Einstein
hated the school’s regimentation, and often clashed
with his teachers. At the age of 15, Einstein felt so
stifled there that he left the school for good.
The previous year, Albert’s parents had moved to
Milan, and left their son with relatives.  After prolonged
discussion, Einstein got his wish to continue his
education in German-speaking Switzerland, in a city
which was more liberal than Munich.
Einstein was highly gifted in mathematics and
interested in physics, and after finishing school,
he decided to study at a university in Zurich. But
science wasn’t the only thing that appealed to the
dashing young man with the walrus moustache.
amateur: doing
something for
personal enjoyment
rather than as a
profession
regimentation: order
or discipline taken to
an extreme
stifled: unable to
breathe; suffocated
liberal: willing to
understand and
respect others’
opinions

age of 21.

remember him now

He also felt a special interest in a fellow student,
Mileva Maric, whom he found to be a “clever
creature.”  This young Serb had come to Switzerland
because the University in Zurich was one of the few
in Europe where women could get degrees. Einstein
saw in her an ally against the “philistines”—
those people in his family and at the university
with whom he was constantly at odds. The couple
fell in love.  Letters survive in which they put their
affection into words, mixing science with
tenderness. Wrote Einstein: “How happy and proud
I shall be when we both have brought our work on
relativity to a victorious conclusion.”
In 1900, at the age of 21, Albert Einstein was a
university graduate and unemployed. He worked
as a teaching assistant, gave private lessons and
finally secured a job in 1902 as a technical expert
in the patent office in Bern. While he was supposed
to be assessing other people’s inventions, Einstein
was actually developing his own ideas in secret. He
is said to have jokingly called his desk drawer at
work the “bureau of theoretical physics.”
One of the famous papers of 1905 was Einstein’s
Special Theory of Relativity, according to which time
and distance are not absolute. Indeed, two perfectly
accurate clocks will not continue to show the same
time if they come together again after a journey if
one of them has been moving very fast relative to
the other. From this followed the world’s most
famous formula which describes the relationship
between mass and energy:

ally: a friend or an
associate
philistines: a word
used disapprovingly
to talk about people
who do not like art,
literature or music
(In this mathematical equation, E stands for energy, m for mass
and c for the speed of the light in a vacuum (about 300,000 km/s).
When you sit with a nice girl for two hours, it
seems like two minutes. When you sit on a
hot stove for two minutes, it seems like two

While Einstein was solving the most difficult
problems in physics, his private life was
unravelling. Albert had wanted to marry Mileva right
after finishing his studies, but his mother was
against it.  She thought Mileva, who was three years
older than her son, was too old for him. She was
also bothered by Mileva’s intelligence. “She is a
book like you,” his mother said. Einstein put the
wedding off.
The pair finally married in January 1903, and
had two sons.  But a few years later, the marriage
faltered. Mileva, meanwhile, was losing her
intellectual ambition and becoming an unhappy
housewife.  After years of constant fighting, the
couple finally divorced in 1919.  Einstein married
his cousin Elsa the same year.
* * *
Einstein’s new personal chapter coincided with
his rise to world fame. In 1915, he had published
his General Theory of Relativity, which provided a
new interpretation of gravity.  An eclipse of the sun
in 1919 brought proof that it was accurate. Einstein
had correctly calculated in advance the extent to
which the light from fixed stars would be deflected
through the sun’s gravitational field. The newspapers
proclaimed his work as “a scientific revolution.”
Einstein received the Nobel Prize for Physics in
1921. He was showered with honours and invitations
from all over the world, and lauded by the press.
* * *
When the Nazis came to power in Germany in
1933, Einstein emigrated to the United States.  Five
years later, the discovery of nuclear fission in Berlin
had American physicists in an uproar.  Many of
them had fled from Fascism, just as Einstein had,
and now they were afraid the Nazis could build and
use an atomic bomb.

At the urging of a colleague, Einstein wrote a
letter to the American President, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, on 2 August 1939, in which he warned:
“A single bomb of this type . . . exploded in a port,
might very well destroy the whole port together with
some of the surrounding territory.” His words did
not fail to have an effect.  The Americans developed
the atomic bomb in a secret project of their own,
and dropped it on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in August 1945.
Einstein was deeply shaken by the extent of the
destruction.  This time he wrote a public missive to
the United Nations.  In it he proposed the formation
of a world government. Unlike the letter to Roosevelt,
this one made no impact.  But over the next decade,
Einstein got ever more involved in politics —
agitating for an end to the arms buildup and using
his popularity to campaign for peace and democracy.
When Einstein died in 1955 at the age of 76, he
was celebrated as a visionary and world citizen as
much as a scientific genius.

In 1931 Charlie Chaplin invited Albert Einstein, who was visiting Hollywood,
to a private screening of his new film, City Lights. As the two men drove into
town together, passersby waved and cheered. Chaplin turned to his guest and
explained: “The people are applauding you because none of them understands
you and applauding me because everybody understands me.”
One of Einstein’s colleagues asked him for his telephone number one
day. Einstein reached for a telephone directory and looked it up. “You don’t
remember your own number?” the man asked, startled.
“No,” Einstein answered. “Why should I memorise something I can so
easily get from a book?” (In fact, Einstein claimed never to memorise anything
which could be looked up in less than two minutes.)

And live alone in the bee-loud glade.
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evenings full of the linnet’s wings.
I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear the lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.

I. 1.What kind of place is Innisfree? Think about:
(i) the three things the poet wants to do when he goes back there (stanza I);
(ii) what he hears and sees there and its effect on him (stanza II);
(iii) what he hears in his “heart’s core” even when he is far away from
Innisfree (stanza III).

By now you may have concluded that Innisfree is a simple, natural place,
full of beauty and peace. How does the poet contrast it with where he now
stands? (Read stanza III.)
Do you think Innisfree is only a place, or a state of mind? Does the poet
actually miss the place of his boyhood days?
II. 1.
Look at the words the poet uses to describe what he sees and hears at
Innisfree
(i) bee-loud glade
(ii) evenings full of the linnet’s wings
(iii) lake water lapping with low sounds
What pictures do these words create in your mind?
Look at these words;
... peace comes dropping slow
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings
What do these words mean to you? What do you think “comes dropping
slow...from the veils of the morning”? What does “to where the cricket sings”
mean?
Health is the greatest gift, contentment
the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best
relationship.

Do you like to look at yourself in the mirror? What do you
think about at such times? Have you ever seen a dog, a cat
or a bird look into a mirror? What do you think it sees?
Now read this humorous story about a doctor, a snake, and
a mirror.
1. “HAS a snake ever coiled itself round any part of
your body? A full-blooded cobra?” All of us fell silent.
The question came from the homeopath. The topic
came up when we were discussing snakes. We
listened attentively as the doctor continued with
his tale.
It was a hot summer night; about ten o’clock. I had
my meal at the restaurant and returned to my room.
I heard a noise from above as I opened the door.
The sound was a familiar one. One could say that
the rats and I shared the room. I took out my box of
matches and lighted the kerosene lamp on the table.
The house was not electrified; it was a small
rented room. I had just set up medical practice and
my earnings were
♠✝✞✟✠✝. I had about sixty rupees
in my suitcase. Along with some shirts and dhotis,
I also possessed one solitary black coat which I
was then wearing.
I took off my black coat, white shirt and not-so-
white vest and hung them up. I opened the two
windows in the room. It was an outer room with
one wall facing the open yard. It had a tiled roof
with long supporting
✝☞ that rested on the beam
over the wall. There was no ceiling. There was a
meagre: small in
quantity.

regular traffic of rats to and from the beam. I made
my bed and pulled it close to the wall. I lay down
but I could not sleep. I got up and went out to the
veranda for a little air, but the wind god seemed to
have taken time off.
I went back into the room and sat down on the
chair. I opened the box beneath the table and took
out a book, the Materia Medica. I opened it at the
table on which stood the lamp and a large mirror; a
small comb lay beside the mirror.
One feels tempted to look into a mirror when it is
near one. I took a look. In those days I was a great
admirer of beauty and I believed in making myself
look handsome. I was unmarried and I was a doctor.
I felt I had to make my presence felt. I picked up the
comb and ran it through my hair and adjusted the
parting so that it looked straight and neat.
Again I heard that sound from above.
I took a close look at my face in the mirror. I
made an important decision — I would shave daily
and grow a thin moustache to look more handsome.
I was after all a bachelor, and a doctor!
I looked into the mirror and smiled. It was an
attractive smile. I made another earth-shaking
decision. I would always keep that attractive smile
on my face ... to look more handsome. I was after
all a bachelor, and a doctor too on top of it!
Again came that noise from above.
I got up, lit a beedi and paced up and down the
room. Then another lovely thought struck me. I would
marry. I would get married to a woman doctor who
had plenty of money and a good medical practice.
She had to be fat; for a valid reason. If I made some
silly mistake and needed to run away she should
not be able to run after me and catch me!
With such thoughts in my mind I resumed my seat
in the chair in front of the table. There were no
more sounds from above. Suddenly there came a
dull thud as if a rubber tube had fallen to the
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
58 / Beehive
ground ... surely nothing to worry about. Even so I
thought I would turn around and take a look. No
sooner had I turned than a fat snake wriggled over
the back of the chair and landed on my shoulder.
The snake’s landing on me and my turning were
simultaneous.
I didn’t jump. I didn’t tremble. I didn’t cry out.
There was no time to do any such thing. The snake
slithered along my shoulder and coiled around my
left arm above the elbow. The hood was spread out
and its head was hardly three or four inches from
my face!
It would not be correct to say merely that I sat
there holding my breath. I was turned to stone. But
my mind was very active. The door opened into
darkness. The room was surrounded by darkness.
In the light of the lamp I sat there like a stone
image in the flesh.
I felt then the great presence of the creator of
this world and this universe. God was there.
Suppose I said something and he did not like it ...
I tried in my imagination to write in bright letters
outside my little heart the words, ‘O God’.
There was some pain in my left arm. It was as if a
thick leaden rod — no, a rod made of molten fire —
was slowly but powerfully crushing my arm. The
arm was beginning to be drained of all strength.
What could I do?
At my slightest movement the snake would strike
me! Death lurked four inches away. Suppose it
struck, what was the medicine I had to take? There
were no medicines in the room. I was but a poor,
foolish and stupid doctor. I forgot my danger and
smiled feebly at myself.
It seemed as if God appreciated that. The snake
turned its head. It looked into the mirror and saw
its reflection. I do not claim that it was the first
snake that had ever looked into a mirror. But it
was certain that the snake was looking into the
mirror. Was it admiring its own beauty? Was it trying
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
The Snake and the Mirror / 59
to make an important decision about growing a
moustache or using eye shadow and mascara or
wearing a vermilion spot on its forehead?
I did not know anything for certain. What sex
was this snake, was it male or female? I will never
know; for the snake unwound itself from my arm
and slowly slithered into my lap. From there it crept
onto the table and moved towards the mirror. Perhaps
it wanted to enjoy its reflection at closer quarters.
I was no mere image cut in granite. I was suddenly
a man of flesh and blood. Still holding my breath I
got up from the chair. I quietly went out through
the door into the veranda. From there I leapt into
the yard and ran for all I was worth.
“Phew !” Each of us heaved a sigh of relief. All of us
lit beedis. Somebody asked, “Doctor, is your wife
very fat?”
“No,” the doctor said. “God willed otherwise. My
life companion is a thin reedy person with the gift
of a sprinter.”
Someone else asked, “Doctor, when you ran did the
snake follow you?”
Perhaps it wanted to enjoy its
reflection at closer quarters.

The doctor replied, “I ran and ran till I reached
a friend’s house. Immediately I smeared oil all over
myself and took a bath. I changed into fresh clothes.
The next morning at about eight-thirty I took my
friend and one or two others to my room to move
my things from there. But we found we had little to
carry. Some thief had removed most of my things.
The room had been cleaned out! But not really, the
thief had left behind one thing as a final insult!’
“What was that?” I asked.
The doctor said, “My vest, the dirty one. The
fellow had such a sense of cleanliness...! The rascal
could have taken it and used it after washing it
with soap and water.”
“Did you see the snake the next day, doctor?”
The doctor laughed, “I’ve never seen it since. It
was a snake which was taken with its own beauty!”

The little girl wondered if/whether she would be home before the TV show
began.
Someone asked, “Why has the thief left the vest behind?”
Someone asked why the thief had left the vest behind.
The words if/whether are used to report questions which begin with: do, will,
can, have, are etc. These questions can be answered ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
Questions beginning with why/when/where/how/which/what are reported using
these same words.
The reporting verbs we use in questions with if/whether/why/when etc.
are: ask, inquire and wonder✳
Remember that in reported speech,
the present tense changes to past tense
here, today, tomorrow, yesterday etc. change to there, that day, the next
day, the day before, etc.
I/you change to me/him/he, etc., as necessary.
Example:
He said to me, “I don’t believe you.”
He said he did not believe me.
She said to him, ‘I don’t believe you.’
She told him that she did not believe him.
Report these questions using if/whether or why/when/where/how/which/what.
Remember the italicised verbs change into the past tense.

Seema asked her, “How long have you lived here?”
Sheila asked the children, “Are you ready to do the work?”
Using some of the expressions given above in exercise III, talk about an incident
when you were very scared. You may have a competition to decide whose story
was the most frightening.
The following paragraph is about the Indian cobra. Read it twice and close your
book. Your teacher will then dictate the paragraph to you. Write it down with
appropriate punctuation marks.
The Indian cobra is the common name for members of the family of venomous
snakes, known for their intimidating looks and deadly bite. Cobras are
recognised by the hoods that they flare when angry or disturbed; the hoods
are created by the extension of the ribs behind the cobras’ heads. Obviously
the best prevention is to avoid getting bitten. This is facilitated by the fact
that humans are not the natural prey of any venomous snake. We are a bit
large for them to swallow whole and they have no means of chopping us up
into bite-size pieces. Nearly all snakebites in humans are the result of a
snake defending itself when it feels threatened. In general snakes are shy
and will simply leave if you give them a chance.
Try to rewrite the story without its humour, merely as a frightening incident.
What details or parts of the story would you leave out?
Read the description given alongside this sketch from a photograph in a
newspaper (Times of India, 4 September 1999). Make up a story about what
the monkey is thinking, or why it is looking into a mirror. Write a paragraph
about it.
THE FAIREST OF THEM ALL
A monkey preens itself using a piece
of mirror, in the Delhi ridge.
(‘To preen oneself’ means to spend a lot of
time making oneself look attractive, and
then admiring one’s appearance. The word
is used in disapproval.)

This poem is a legend of an old lady who angered Saint Peter
because of her greed.
Away, away in the Northland,
Where the hours of the day are few,
And the nights are so long in winter
That they cannot sleep them through;
Where they harness the swift reindeer
To the sledges, when it snows;
And the children look like bear’s cubs
In their funny, furry clothes:
They tell them a curious story —
I don’t believe ’tis true;
And yet you may learn a lesson
If I tell the tale to you.
Once, when the good Saint Peter
Lived in the world below,
And walked about it, preaching,
Just as he did, you know,
He came to the door of a cottage,
In travelling round the earth,
Where a little woman was making cakes,
And baking them on the hearth;
And being faint with fasting,
For the day was almost done,
He asked her, from her store of cakes,
To give him a single one.
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
So she made a very little cake,
But as it baking lay,
She looked at it, and thought it seemed
Too large to give away.
Therefore she kneaded another,
And still a smaller one;
But it looked, when she turned it over,
As large as the first had done.
Then she took a tiny scrap of dough,
And rolled and rolled it flat;
And baked it thin as a wafer —
But she couldn’t part with that.
For she said, “My cakes that seem too small
When I eat of them myself
Are yet too large to give away.”
So she put them on the shelf.
Then good Saint Peter grew angry,
For he was hungry and faint;
And surely such a woman
Was enough to provoke a saint.
And he said, “You are far too selfish
To dwell in a human form,
To have both food and shelter,
And fire to keep you warm.
Now, you shall build as the birds do,
And shall get your scanty food
By boring, and boring, and boring,
All day in the hard, dry wood.”
Then up she went through the chimney,
Never speaking a word,
And out of the top flew a woodpecker,
For she was changed to a bird.
66 / Beehive
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
She had a scarlet cap on her head,
And that was left the same;
But all the rest of her clothes were burned
Black as a coal in the flame.
And every country schoolboy
Has seen her in the wood,
Where she lives in the trees till this very day,
Boring and boring for food.

Can you think of any scientists, who have also been
statesmen?
A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, whose projects in space, defence and
nuclear technology guided India into the twenty-first century,
became our eleventh President in 2002.
In his autobiography, Wings of Fire, he speaks of his
childhood.
1. I WAS born into a middle-class Tamil family in the
island town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras
State. My father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much
formal education nor much wealth; despite these
disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom
and a true generosity of spirit. He had an ideal
helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not recall
the exact number of people she fed every day, but I
am quite certain that far more outsiders ate with
us than all the members of our own family
put together.
I was one of many children — a short boy with
rather undistinguished looks, born to tall and
handsome parents. We lived in our ancestral house,
which was built in the middle of the nineteenth
century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of
limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in
Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all
inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all
necessities were provided for, in terms of food,
medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say mine
was a very secure childhood, both materially
and emotionally.

The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I
was eight years old. For reasons I have never been
able to understand, a sudden demand for tamarind
seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the
seeds and sell them to a provision shop on Mosque
Street. A day’s collection would fetch me the princely
sum of one anna. My brother-in-law Jallaluddin
would tell me stories about the War which I would
later attempt to trace in the headlines in Dinamani.
Our area, being isolated, was completely unaffected
by the War. But soon India was forced to join the
Allied Forces and something like a state of
emergency was declared. The first casualty came
in the form of the suspension of the train halt at
Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to
be bundled and thrown out from the moving train
on the Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram
and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin,
who distributed newspapers in Rameswarm, to look
for a helping hand to catch the bundles and, as if
naturally, I filled the slot. Samsuddin helped me
earn my first wages. Half a century later, I can still
feel the surge of pride in earning my own money for
the first time.
Every child is born, with some inherited
characteristics, into a specific socio-economic and
emotional environment, and trained in certain ways
by figures of authority. I inherited honesty and self-
discipline from my father; from my mother, I
inherited faith in goodness and deep kindness and
so did my three brothers and sister. I had three
close friends in my childhood — Ramanadha Sastry,
Aravindan and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were
from orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children,
none of us ever felt any difference amongst ourselves
because of our religious differences and upbringing.
In fact, Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi
Lakshmana Sastry, the high priest of the
Rameswaram temple. Later, he took over the
priesthood of the Rameswaram temple from his
princely sum:

father; Aravindan went into the business of
arranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and
Sivaprakasan became a catering contractor for the
Southern Railways.
During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam
ceremony, our family used to arrange boats with a
special platform for carrying idols of the Lord from
the temple to the marriage site, situated in the
middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha which was
near our house. Events from the Ramayana and
from the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories
my mother and grandmother would tell the children
in our family.
One day when I was in the fifth standard at the
Rameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher
came to our class. I used to wear a cap which
marked me as a Muslim, and I always sat in the
front row next to Ramanadha Sastry, who wore the

sacred thread. The new teacher could not stomach
a Hindu priest’s son sitting with a Muslim boy. In
accordance with our social ranking as the new
teacher saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the
back bench. I felt very sad, and so did Ramanadha
Sastry. He looked utterly downcast as I shifted to
my seat in the last row. The image of him weeping
when I shifted to the last row left a lasting
impression on me.
After school, we went home and told our
respective parents about the incident. Lakshmana
Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our presence,
told the teacher that he should not spread the poison
of social inequality and communal intolerance in
the minds of innocent children. He bluntly asked
the teacher to either apologise or quit the school
and the island. Not only did the teacher regret his
behaviour, but the strong sense of conviction
Lakshmana Sastry conveyed ultimately reformed

On the whole, the small society of Rameswaram
was very rigid in terms of the segregation of different
social groups. However, my science teacher
Sivasubramania Iyer, though an orthodox Brahmin
with a very conservative wife, was something of a
rebel. He did his best to break social barriers so
that people from varying backgrounds could mingle
easily. He used to spend hours with me and would
say, “Kalam, I want you to develop so that you
are on par with the highly educated people of the
big cities.”
One day, he invited me to his home for a meal.
His wife was horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy
being invited to dine in her ritually pure kitchen.

meal. His wife watched us from behind the kitchen
door. I wondered whether she had observed any
difference in the way I ate rice, drank water or
cleaned the floor after the meal. When I was leaving
his house, Sivasubramania Iyer invited me to join
him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing
my hesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying,
“Once you decide to change the system, such
problems have to be confronted.” When I visited his
house the next week, Sivasubramania Iyer’s wife
took me inside her kitchen and served me food with
her own hands.
Then the Second World War was over and India’s
freedom was imminent. “Indians will build their
own India,” declared Gandhiji. The whole country
was filled with an unprecedented optimism. I asked

have to go away to grow. Does the seagull not fly
across the sun, alone and without a nest?” He quoted
Khalil Gibran to my hesitant mother, “Your children

of Life’s longing for itself. They come through you but
not from you. You may give them your love but not
your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.”

To Sir, with Love
From Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, it’s been a long journey.
Talking to Nona Walia on the eve of Teacher’s Day, President Dr A.P.J. Abdul
Kalam talks about life’s toughest lessons learnt and his mission — being a
teacher to the Indian youth. “A proper education would help nurture a sense
of dignity and self-respect among our youth,” says President Kalam.
There’s still a child in him though, and he’s still curious about learning
new things. Life’s a mission for President Kalam.
Nonetheless, he remembers his first lesson in life and how it changed
his destiny. “I was studying in Standard V, and must have been all of 10. My
teacher, Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was telling us how birds fly. He drew a
diagram of a bird on the blackboard, depicting the wings, tail and the body
with the head and then explained how birds soar to the sky. At the end of
the class, I said I didn’t understand. Then he asked the other students if
they had understood, but nobody had understood how birds fly,” he recalls.
“That evening, the entire class was taken to Rameswarm shore,” the
President continues. “My teacher showed us sea birds. We saw marvellous
formations of them flying and how their wings flapped. Then my teacher
asked us, ‘Where is the birds’ engine and how is it powered?’ I knew then
that birds are powered by their own life and motivation. I understood all
about birds’ dynamics. This was real teaching — a theoretical lesson coupled
with a live practical example. Sri Siva Subramania Iyer was a great teacher.”
That day, my future was decided. My destiny was changed. I knew my
future had to be about flight and flight systems.

Have you ever thought of some people as strange, or other
countries as ‘foreign’? We have many ways of thinking of
other people as different from ‘us’, as ‘them.’ ‘They’ may
belong to a different country, or speak a different language.
In this poem, however, the poet reminds us of the many ways
in which we are all the same — for we are all human.
Remember, no men are strange, no countries foreign
Beneath all uniforms, a single body breathes
Like ours: the land our brothers walk upon
Is earth like this, in which we all shall lie.
They, too, aware of sun and air and water,
Are fed by peaceful harvests, by war’s long winter starv’d.
Their hands are ours, and in their lines we read
A labour not different from our own.
Remember they have eyes like ours that wake
Or sleep, and strength that can be won
By love. In every land is common life
That all can recognise and understand.
Let us remember, whenever we are told
To hate our brothers, it is ourselves
That we shall dispossess, betray, condemn.
Remember, we who take arms against each other
It is the human earth that we defile.
Our hells of fire and dust outrage the innocence
Of air that is everywhere our own,
Remember, no men are foreign, and no countries strange.

Do you like going on trips? What kind of trips do you enjoy
most?
How do you feel about having to pack for a trip?
Have you ever discovered on a trip that you have forgotten to
pack a few things you very much need, or that you can’t find
them easily?
Does this make you angry or does it make you laugh at
yourself?
Now read this description of how the author and his friends
pack.
1. I SAID I’d pack.
I rather pride myself on my packing. Packing is
one of those many things that I feel I know more
about than any other person living. (It surprises
me myself, sometimes, how many such things there
are.) I impressed the fact upon George and Harris
and told them that they had better leave the whole
matter entirely to me. They fell into the suggestion
with a readiness that had something uncanny about
it. George put on a pipe and spread himself over
the easy-chair, and Harris cocked his legs on the
table and lit a cigar.
This was hardly what I intended. What I had
meant, of course, was, that I should boss the job,
and that Harris and George should potter about
under my directions, I pushing them aside every
now and then with, “Oh, you!” “Here, let me do it.”
“There you are, simple enough!” — really teaching
them, as you might say. Their taking it in the way

they did irritated me. There is nothing does irritate
me more than seeing other people sitting about doing
nothing when I’m working.
I lived with a man once who used to make me
mad that way. He would loll on the sofa and watch
me doing things by the hour together. He said it did
him real good to look on at me, messing about.
Now, I’m not like that. I can’t sit still and see
another man slaving and working. I want to get up
and superintend, and walk round with my hands
in my pockets, and tell him what to do. It is my
energetic nature. I can’t help it.
However, I did not say anything, but started the
packing. It seemed a longer job than I had thought
it was going to be; but I got the bag finished at last,
and I sat on it and strapped it.
“Ain’t you going to put the boots in?” said Harris.
And I looked round, and found I had forgotten them.
That’s just like Harris. He couldn’t have said a word
until I’d got the bag shut and strapped, of course.
And George laughed — one of those irritating,
senseless laughs of his. They do make me so wild.
I opened the bag and packed the boots in; and
then, just as I was going to close it, a horrible idea
occurred to me. Had I packed my toothbrush? I don’t
know how it is, but I never do know whether I’ve
packed my toothbrush.
My toothbrush is a thing that haunts me when I’m
travelling, and makes my life a misery. I dream
that I haven’t packed it, and wake up in a cold
perspiration, and get out of bed and hunt for it.
And, in the morning, I pack it before I have used it,
and have to unpack again to get it, and it is always
the last thing I turn out of the bag; and then I
repack and forget it, and have to rush upstairs for
it at the last moment and carry it to the railway
station, wrapped up in my pocket-handkerchief.
Of course I had to turn every mortal thing out
now, and, of course, I could not find it. I rummaged
the things up into much the same state that they
haunts: here, to
repeatedly give
trouble

every ordinary thing

in a hurried or
careless way

must have been before the world was created, and
when chaos reigned. Of course, I found George’s
and Harris’s eighteen times over, but I couldn’t find
my own. I put the things back one by one, and held
everything up and shook it. Then I found it inside a
boot. I repacked once more.
When I had finished, George asked if the soap
was in. I said I didn’t care a hang whether the soap
was in or whether it wasn’t; and I slammed the bag
shut and strapped it, and found that I had packed my
tobacco-pouch in it, and had to re-open it. It got shut
up finally at 10.05 p.m., and then there remained the
hampers to do. Harris said that we should be wanting
to start in less than twelve hours’ time and thought
that he and George had better do the rest; and I agreed
and sat down, and they had a go.
They began in a light-hearted spirit, evidently
intending to show me how to do it. I made no
hampers: large
baskets for carrying

comment; I only waited. With the exception of
George, Harris is the worst packer in this world;
and I looked at the piles of plates and cups, and
kettles, and bottles, and jars, and pies, and stoves,
and cakes, and tomatoes, etc., and felt that the
thing would soon become exciting.
It did. They started with breaking a cup. That
was the first thing they did. They did that just to
show you what they could do, and to get you
interested.
Then Harris packed the strawberry jam on top
of a tomato and squashed it, and they had to pick
out the tomato with a teaspoon.
And then it was George’s turn, and he trod
on the butter. I didn’t say anything, but I came over
and sat on the edge of the table and watched them.

It irritated them more than anything I could have
said. I felt that. It made them nervous and excited,
and they stepped on things, and put things behind
them, and then couldn’t find them when they
wanted them; and they packed the pies at the
bottom, and put heavy things on top, and smashed
the pies in.
They upset salt over everything, and as for the
butter! I never saw two men do more with one-and-
two pence worth of butter in my whole life than
they did. After George had got it off his slipper, they
tried to put it in the kettle. It wouldn’t go in, and
what was in wouldn’t come out. They did scrape it
out at last, and put it down on a chair, and Harris
sat on it, and it stuck to him, and they went looking
for it all over the room.
“I’ll take my oath I put it down on that chair,”
said George, staring at the empty seat.
“I saw you do it myself, not a minute ago,” said
Harris.
Then they started round the room again looking
for it; and then they met again in the centre and
stared at one another.
“Most extraordinary thing I ever heard of,” said
George.
“So mysterious!” said Harris.
Then George got round at the back of Harris
and saw it.
“Why, here it is all the time,” he exclaimed,
indignantly.
“Where?” cried Harris, spinning round.
“Stand still, can’t you!” roared George, flying
after him.
And they got it off, and packed it in the teapot.
Montmorency was in it all, of course.
Montmorency’s ambition in life is to get in the way
and be sworn at. If he can squirm in anywhere
where he particularly is not wanted, and be a
perfect nuisance, and make people mad, and have

things thrown at his head, then he feels his day
has not been wasted.
To get somebody to stumble over him, and curse
him steadily for an hour, is his highest aim and
object; and, when he has succeeded in
accomplishing this, his conceit becomes quite
unbearable.
He came and sat down on things, just when
they were wanted to be packed; and he laboured
under the fixed belief that, whenever Harris
or George reached out their hand for anything,
it was his cold damp nose that they wanted.
He put his leg into the jam, and he worried
the teaspoons, and he pretended that the lemons
were rats, and got into the hamper and killed

three of them before Harris could land him with
the frying-pan.
Harris said I encouraged him. I didn’t encourage
him. A dog like that doesn’t want any encouragement.
It’s the natural, original sin that is born in him
that makes him do things like that.
The packing was done at 12.50; and Harris sat
on the big hamper, and said he hoped nothing would
be found broken. George said that if anything was
broken it was broken, which reflection seemed to
comfort him. He also said he was ready for bed. We
were all ready for bed. Harris was to sleep with us
that night, and we went upstairs.
We tossed for beds, and Harris had to sleep with
me. He said :
“Do you prefer the inside or the outside, J.?”
I said I generally preferred to sleep inside a bed.
Harris said it was odd.
George said:
“What time shall I wake you fellows?”
Harris said:
“Seven.”
I said:
“No — six,” because I wanted to write some
letters.
Harris and I had a bit of a row over it, but at
last split the difference, and said half-past six.
“Wake us at 6.30, George,” we said.
George made no answer, and we found, on going
over, that he had been asleep for sometime; so we
placed the bath where he could tumble into it on
getting out in the morning, and went to bed
ourselves.

This unit has two biographical pieces that depict persistent endeavours to
reach the top. Part II of this unit is taken from a newspaper. The language is
very current and idiomatic. An exercise of matching words and phrases to
their meanings has been given as a pre-reading activity to facilitate students’
understanding and appreciation of this part of the text.
In this unit students are asked to imagine that they have to give a speech.
They may wish to read the texts of well-known speeches such as Nehru’s
‘Tryst with Destiny’. A speech is a formal use of spoken language. It must be
prepared meticulously.
The language is formal but should be made powerful by the use of balance
(“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your
country.” — Kennedy), imagery (“The light has gone out of our lives” — Nehru)
and other such rhetorical devices. It can be enriched by the use of examples
and anecdotes.
The Writing task of composing an article for a school magazine can be prepared
for by looking at other examples of such articles in newspapers. This task
makes a beginning in helping students to write for the print media. Encourage
them to work within a given word limit (such as 500 words, or 1000 words),
and to use everyday, contemporary language.
Help students to write a description of Santosh Yadav’s character by drawing
their attention to her background, likes and dislikes, her humanity and her
contribution to society.
This unit is about a strong attachment between a human being and a wild
animal that becomes a pet. Encourage the students to locate the incidents
that show this in the story, and to give examples from their own experience.
The exercise of referring to an index for obtaining specific information on a
given topic aims to strengthen students’ reference skills. Try to add some
examples of your own from other areas of the curriculum where consulting an
index is useful.
The passage to be dictated is a scrambled story. After the dictation, allow the
students to go through their writing carefully to rearrange the incidents logically.
The writing activities are designed to help students to build up an argument.

‘Kathmandu’ is excerpted from Heaven Lake, a travelogue in which Vikram
Seth gives an account of what he saw, thought and felt when he travelled from
China to Tibet, from Heaven Lake to the Himalayas.
The map reading activity and the activity on locating the possible routes (by
road, rail or air) from Kathmandu to different places in India are designed to
link the lesson to the outside world. Students may wish to consult brochures
or travel guides, visit a  travel agency or call them on the telephone, speak to
people who have been to Nepal, and so on. This is a ‘communicative’ and
‘authentic’ task.
To prepare for the second Speaking task, students can listen to cricket/
football commentaries or eyewitness accounts of the Independence Day/
Republic Day parade in class or at home on radio or T.V.  Encourage them
to observe the use of the language and follow the narration. Have a
discussion in the class on the features of the commentary (its language, its
liveliness, etc.)
A diary can be an opportunity to write freely about our life and the things
that happen to us — funny, sad, happy, embarrassing or fearful. We also
make notes on places we visit or our encounters with people.
The Writing task suggests that diary entries can form the basis of a
travelogue, and asks students to imagine a journey to Kathmandu. It may be
supplemented by an actual travelogue-writing task given after a long holiday,
or after a class trip out of the town.
This one-act play is to be read aloud in class by assigning roles to students.
Draw the students’ attention to the stage setting, stage directions, description
of the characters, their movements, gestures and tonal variations, since these
combine to bring out the effect of the play.
The play has many examples of wit and irony. Two examples are given in an
exercise. You can add a few more for the students to have a clear understanding.
The dictionary task in this unit is to help children locate the right meaning
from a dictionary for a word they come across while reading. The task draws
students’ attention to ‘signposts’ such as parts of speech that help match use
to meaning. Encourage the students to look at more entries in the dictionary
and observe the meanings of words that occur as different parts of speech
(adjective, noun, verb).

Think for a while and make a list of three to five persons you

Your teacher will then discuss your choices with you to find
out who the top five idols of your class are.
1. The only woman in the world who
has scaled Mt Everest twice was
born in a society where the birth of
a son was regarded as a blessing,
and a daughter, though not
considered a curse, was not
generally welcome. When her
mother was expecting Santosh, a
travelling ‘holy man’, giving her his
blessing, assumed that she wanted
a son. But, to everyone’s surprise,
the unborn child’s grandmother, who
was standing close by, told him that
they did not want a son. The ‘holy
surprised!
Nevertheless, he gave the requested
blessing ... and as destiny would
have it, the blessing seemed to work.
Santosh was born the sixth child in
a family with five sons, a sister to
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in

five brothers. She was born in the small village of
Joniyawas of Rewari District in Haryana.
The girl was given the name ‘Santosh’, which
means contentment. But Santosh was not always
content with her place in a traditional way of life.
She began living life on her own terms from the
start. Where other girls wore traditional Indian
dresses, Santosh preferred shorts. Looking back,
she says now, “From the very beginning I was quite
determined that if I chose a correct and a rational
path, the others around me had to change, not me.”
Santosh’s parents were affluent landowners who
could afford to send their children to the best
schools, even to the country’s capital, New Delhi,
which was quite close by. But, in line with the
prevailing custom in the family, Santosh had to
make do with the local village school. So, she decided
to fight the system in her own quiet way when
the right moment arrived. And the right moment
came when she turned sixteen. At sixteen, most of
the girls in her village used to get married.
Santosh was also under pressure from her parents
to do the same.
A marriage as early as that was the last thing
on her mind. She threatened her parents that she
would never marry if she did not get a proper
education. She left home and got herself enrolled
in a school in Delhi. When her parents refused to
pay for her education, she politely informed them
of her plans to earn money by working part time to
pay her school fees. Her parents then agreed to pay
for her education.
Wishing always to study “a bit more” and with
her father slowly getting used to her urge for more
education, Santosh passed the high school
examinations and went to Jaipur. She joined
Maharani College and got a room in Kasturba Hostel.
Santosh remembers, “Kasturba Hostel faced the
the last thing: the
least important thing
in line with: following
or in accordance

Aravalli Hills. I used to watch villagers from my
room, going up the hill and suddenly vanishing after
a while. One day I decided to check it out myself. I
found nobody except a few mountaineers. I asked if
I could join them. To my pleasant surprise, they
answered in the affirmative and motivated me to
take to climbing.”
Then there was no looking back for this
determined young girl. She saved money and enrolled
in a course at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of
Mountaineering. “My college semester in Jaipur was
to end in April but it ended on the nineteenth of
May. And I was supposed to be in Uttarkashi on
the twenty-first. So, I did not go back home; instead,
I headed straight for the training. I had to write a
letter of apology to my father without whose
permission I had got myself enrolled at Uttarkashi.”
Thereafter, Santosh went on an
expedition every year. Her climbing
skills matured rapidly. Also, she
developed a remarkable resistance to
cold and the altitude. Equipped with
an iron will, physical endurance and
an amazing mental toughness, she
proved
herself
repeatedly.
culmination of her hard work and
sincerity came in 1992, just four years
after she had shyly asked the Aravalli
mountaineers if she could join them.
At barely twenty years of age, Santosh
Yadav scaled Mt Everest, becoming the
youngest woman in the world to
achieve the feat. If her climbing skills,
physical fitness, and mental strength
impressed her seniors, her concern for
others and desire to work together with
them found her a special place in the
hearts of fellow climbers.

During the 1992 Everest mission, Santosh Yadav
provided special care to a climber who lay dying at
the South Col. She was unfortunately unsuccessful
in saving him. However, she managed to save
another climber, Mohan Singh, who would have
met with the same fate had she not shared her
oxygen with him.
Within twelve months, Santosh found herself a
member of an Indo-Nepalese Women’s Expedition
that invited her to join them. She then scaled the
Everest a second time, thus setting a record as the
only woman to have scaled the Everest twice, and
securing for herself and India a unique place in the
annals of mountaineering. In recognition
of her achievements, the Indian government
bestowed upon her one of the nation’s top honours,
the Padmashri.
Describing her feelings when she was literally
‘on top of the world’, Santosh has said, “It took some
time for the enormity of the moment to sink
in ... Then I unfurled the Indian tricolour and held
it aloft on the roof of the world. The feeling is
indescribable. The Indian flag was flying on top of
the world. It was truly a spiritual moment. I felt

1. THERE is something disarming about Maria
Sharapova, something at odds with her ready smile
and glamorous attire. And that something in her
lifted her on Monday, 22 August 2005 to the world
number one position in women’s tennis. All this
happened in almost no time. Poised beyond her
years, the Siberian born teenager took just four
years as a professional to reach the pinnacle.

Reach for the Top / 105
However, the rapid ascent in a fiercely
competitive world began nine years before with a
level of sacrifice few children would be prepared to
endure. Little Maria had not yet celebrated her tenth
birthday when she was packed off to train in the
United States. That trip to Florida with her father
Yuri launched her on the path to success and
stardom. But it also required a heart-wrenching
two-year separation from her mother Yelena. The
latter was compelled to stay back in Siberia because
of visa restrictions. The nine-year-old girl had
already learnt an important lesson in life — that
tennis excellence would only come at a price.
“I used to be so lonely,” Maria Sharapova recalls.
“I missed my mother terribly. My father was working
as much as he could to keep my tennis-training
going. So, he couldn’t see me either.
“Because I was so young, I used to go to bed at
8 p.m. The other tennis pupils would come in at

11 p.m. and wake me up and order me to tidy up
the room and clean it.
“Instead of letting that depress me, I became
more quietly determined and mentally tough.
I learnt how to take care of myself. I never thought
of quitting because I knew what I wanted. When
you come from nothing and you have nothing, then
it makes you very hungry and determined ... I would
have put up with much more humiliation and insults
than that to steadfastly pursue my dream.”
That toughness runs through Maria even today.
It was the key to her bagging the women’s singles
crown at Wimbledon in 2004 and to her meteoric
rise to the world number one spot the following year.
While her journey from the frozen plains of
Siberia to the summit of women’s tennis has touched
the hearts of tennis fans, for the youngster herself
there appears to be no room for sentiment. The
straight looks and the answers she gives when asked
about her ambition make it amply clear that she
considers the sacrifices were worth it. “I am very,
very competitive. I work hard at what I do. It’s my
job.” This is her mantra for success.
Though Maria Sharapova speaks with a
pronounced American accent, she proudly parades
her Russian nationality. Clearing all doubts, she
says, “I’m Russian. It’s true that the U.S. is a big
part of my life. But I have Russian citizenship. My
blood is totally Russian. I will play the Olympics
for Russia if they want me.”
Like any number of teenaged sensations, Maria
Sharapova lists fashion, singing and dancing as her
hobbies. She loves reading the novels of Arthur Conan
Doyle. Her fondness for sophisticated evening gowns
appears at odds with her love of pancakes with
chocolate spread and fizzy orange drinks.
Maria Sharapova cannot be pigeon-holed or
categorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to
succeed and readiness to sacrifice have lifted her
to the top of the world. Few would grudge her the
www.zero2zenith.in

riches she is now reaping. This is what she has to
say about her monetary gains from tennis:
“Of course, money is a motivation. Tennis is a
business and a sport, but the most important thing
is to become number one in the world. That’s the
dream that kept me going.”

Santosh Yadav and Maria Sharapova and complete the table given below with

The Raincoat
After four years of drought in a small town in the Northeast, the Vicar
gathered everyone together for a pilgrimage to the mountain, where they
would pray together and ask for the rain to return.
The priest noticed a boy in the group wearing a raincoat.
“Have you gone mad?” he asked. “It hasn’t rained in this region for
five years, the heat will kill you climbing the mountain.”
“I have a cold, father. If we are going to ask God for rain, can you
imagine the way back from the mountain? It’s going to be such a downpour
that I need to be prepared.”
At that moment a great crash was heard in the sky and the first
drops began to fall. A boy’s faith was enough to bring about a miracle
that not even those most prepared truly believed in.

You must have observed people cutting down trees. But can
they kill a tree? Is it easy to do so? Let’s read the poem and
find out what the poet says on killing a tree.
It takes much time to kill a tree,
Not a simple jab of the knife
Will do it. It has grown
Slowly consuming the earth,
Rising out of it, feeding
Upon its crust, absorbing
Years of sunlight, air, water,
And out of its leprous hide
Sprouting leaves.
So hack and chop
But this alone wont do it.
Not so much pain will do it.
The bleeding bark will heal
And from close to the ground
Will rise curled green twigs,
Miniature boughs
Which if unchecked will expand again
To former size.
The root is to be pulled out —
Out of the anchoring earth;
It is to be roped, tied,
And pulled out — snapped out
 ✁✂✄✄✂
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
Or pulled out entirely,
Out from the earth-cave,
And the strength of the tree exposed
The source, white and wet,
The most sensitive, hidden
For years inside the earth.
Then the matter
Of scorching and choking
In sun and air,
Browning, hardening,
Twisting, withering,
And then it is done.

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.

But only God can make a tree.

Can there be love and friendship between human beings and
wild animals? Let’s read a fascinating account of an orphaned
sloth bear that was rescued by the author.
Sloth bears inhabit forested areas,
including the tropical rain forests of
India and grasslands at lower
elevations. Sloth bears have very
shaggy hair and long muzzles. Using
their claws to dig, they can then use
their lips to form a tube, which can go
deep into the ground, or into hard-to-
reach areas like dead trees for their
food. Their main food is termites. You
can hear them suck up their food from
several feet away.
1. I WILL begin with Bruno, my wife’s pet sloth bear. I
got him for her by accident.
Two years ago we were passing through the
sugarcane fields near Mysore. People were driving
away the wild pigs from the fields by shooting at
them. Some were shot and some escaped. We
thought that everything was over when suddenly a
black sloth bear came out panting in the hot sun.
Now I will not shoot a sloth bear wantonly but,
unfortunately for the poor beast, one of my
companions did not feel that way about it, and
promptly shot the bear on the spot.
As we watched the fallen animal we were
surprised to see that the black fur on its back moved
and left the prostrate body. Then we saw it was a
wantonly: for no
good reason
prostrate: lying on
the ground facing

baby bear that had been riding on its mother’s back
when the sudden shot had killed her. The little
creature ran around its prostrate parent making a
pitiful noise.
I ran up to it to attempt a capture. It scooted
into the sugarcane field. Following it with my
companions, I was at last able to grab it by the
scruff of its neck while it snapped and tried to
scratch me with its long, hooked claws.
We put it in one of the gunny-bags we had brought
and when I got back to Bangalore I duly presented it
to my wife. She was delighted! She at once put a
coloured ribbon around its neck, and after discovering
the cub was a ‘boy’ she christened it Bruno.
Bruno soon took to drinking milk from a bottle.
It was but a step further and within a very few
days he started eating and drinking everything else.
And everything is the right word, for he ate porridge
made from any ingredients, vegetables, fruit, nuts,
meat (especially pork), curry and rice regardless of
condiments and chillies, bread, eggs, chocolates,
sweets, pudding, ice-cream, etc., etc., etc. As for
drink: milk, tea, coffee, lime-juice, aerated water,
buttermilk, beer, alcoholic liquor and, in fact,
anything liquid. It all went down with relish.
The bear became very attached to our two
Alsatian dogs and to all the children of the tenants
living in our bungalow. He was left quite free in his
younger days and spent his time in playing, running
into the kitchen and going to sleep in our beds.
One day an accident befell him. I put down poison
(barium carbonate) to kill the rats and mice that
had got into my library. Bruno entered the library
as he often did, and he ate some of the poison.
Paralysis set in to the extent that he could not stand
on his feet. But he dragged himself on his stumps
to my wife, who called me. I guessed what had
happened. Off I rushed in the car to the vet’s
residence. A case of poisoning! Tame Bear — barium
carbonate — what to do?

Out came his medical books, and a feverish

sir?” “Barium carbonate”. “Ah yes—B—Ba—Barium
Salts—Ah! Barium carbonate! Symptoms —
paralysis—treatment—injections of ... Just a
minute, sir. I’ll bring my syringe and the medicine.”
A dash back to the car. Bruno still floundering
about on his stumps, but clearly weakening rapidly;
some vomiting, heavy breathing, with heaving flanks

Hold him, everybody! In goes the hypodermic—
Bruno squeals — 10 c.c. of the antidote enters his

later: condition unchanged! Another 10 c.c. injected!
Ten minutes later: breathing less stertorous—
Bruno can move his arms and legs a little although
he cannot stand yet. Thirty minutes later: Bruno
gets up and has a great feed! He looks at us
disdainfully, as much as to say, ‘What’s barium
carbonate to a big black bear like me?’ Bruno is
still eating.
Another time he found nearly one gallon of old
engine oil which I had drained from the sump of
the Studebaker and was keeping as a weapon
against the inroads of termites. He promptly drank
the lot. But it had no ill effects whatever.
The months rolled on and Bruno had grown many
times the size he was when he came. He had
equalled the Alsatians in height and had even
outgrown them. But was just as sweet, just as
mischievous, just as playful. And he was very fond
of us all. Above all, he loved my wife, and she loved
him too! She had changed his name from Bruno, to
Baba, a Hindustani word signifying ‘small boy’. And
he could do a few tricks, too. At the command, ‘Baba,
wrestle’, or ‘Baba, box,’ he vigorously tackled anyone
who came forward for a rough and tumble. Give
him a stick and say ‘Baba, hold gun’, and he pointed
the stick at you. Ask him, ‘Baba, where’s baby?’

affectionately a stump of wood which he had
carefully concealed in his straw bed. But because
of the tenants’ children, poor Bruno, or Baba, had
to be kept chained most of the time.
Then my son and I advised my wife, and friends
advised her too, to give Baba to the zoo at Mysore.
He was getting too big to keep at home. After some
weeks of such advice she at last consented. Hastily,
and before she could change her mind, a letter was
written to the curator of the zoo. Did he want a
tame bear for his collection? He replied, “Yes”. The
zoo sent a cage from Mysore in a lorry, a distance
of eighty-seven miles, and Baba was packed off.
We all missed him greatly; but in a sense we
were relieved. My wife was inconsolable. She wept
and fretted. For the first few days she would not
eat a thing. Then she wrote a number of letters to
the curator. How was Baba? Back came the replies,
“Well, but fretting; he refuses food too.”
After that, friends visiting Mysore were begged
to make a point of going to the zoo and seeing how
Baba was getting along. They reported that he was
well but looked very thin and sad. All the keepers
at the zoo said he was fretting. For three months I
managed to restrain my wife from visiting Mysore.
Then she said one day, “I must see Baba. Either
you take me by car; or I will go myself by bus or
train.” So I took her by car.
Friends had conjectured that the bear would
not recognise her. I had thought so too. But while
she was yet some yards from his cage Baba saw
her and recognised her. He howled with happiness.
She ran up to him, petted him through the bars,
and he stood on his head in delight.
For the next three hours she would not leave
that cage. She gave him tea, lemonade, cakes, ice-
cream and what not. Then ‘closing time’ came and
we had to leave. My wife cried bitterly; Baba cried
bitterly; even the hardened curator and the keepers
fretting: worried;
unhappy; not relaxed

felt depressed. As for me, I had reconciled myself to
what I knew was going to happen next.
“Oh please, sir,” she asked the curator, “may I
have my Baba back”? Hesitantly, he answered,
“Madam, he belongs to the zoo and is Government
property now. I cannot give away Government
property. But if my boss, the superintendent
at Bangalore agrees, certainly you may have
him back.”
There followed the return journey to Bangalore
and a visit to the superintendent’s bungalow. A
tearful pleading: “Baba and I are both fretting for
each other. Will you please give him back to me?”
He was a kind-hearted man and consented.
Not only that, but he wrote to the curator telling
For the next three hours she would not
leave that cage ...
www.zero2zenith.in

him to lend us a cage for transporting the bear
to Bangalore.
Back we went to Mysore again, armed with the
superintendent’s letter. Baba was driven into a
small cage and hoisted on top of the car; the cage
was tied securely, and a slow and careful return
journey to Bangalore was accomplished.
Once home, a squad of coolies were engaged for
special work in our compound. An island was made
for Baba. It was twenty feet long and fifteen feet
wide, and was surrounded by a dry pit, or moat, six
feet wide and seven feet deep. A wooden box that
once housed fowls was brought and put on the
island for Baba to sleep in at night. Straw was placed
inside to keep him warm, and his ‘baby’, the gnarled
stump, along with his ‘gun’, the piece of bamboo,
both of which had been sentimentally preserved
since he had been sent away to the zoo, were put
back for him to play with.
In a few days the coolies hoisted the cage on to
the island and Baba was released. He was delighted;
standing on his hindlegs, he pointed his ‘gun’ and
cradled his ‘baby’. My wife spent hours sitting on a
chair there while he sat on her lap. He was fifteen
months old and pretty heavy too!
The way my wife reaches the island and leaves
it is interesting. I have tied a rope to the overhanging
branch of a mango tree with a loop at its end. Putting
one foot in the loop, she kicks off with the other, to
bridge the six-foot gap that constitutes the width of
the surrounding pit. The return journey is made
the same way. But who can say now that a sloth
bear has no sense of affection, no memory and no
individual characteristics?

“Out came his medical books, and a feverish reference to index began:
What poison did you say, sir?” “Barium carbonate”. “Ah yes—B—Ba—
Barium Salts—Ah! Barium carbonate! Symptoms—paralysis—
treatment—injections of ... Just a minute, sir. I’ll bring my syringe and

There is an on-going debate on whether snake charmers should continue in
their profession. You can get some idea about the debate from the newspaper

groups, and write either for or against the profession of snake charmers.
Report comes in support of snake charmers
☞✌✍✎✎
NEW DELHI, JUNE 15. Over 30 years after the introduction of the Wildlife
Protection Act (WPA) that banned the catching of snakes in India, a small
community of snake charmers continues to practise the trade catching over
400,000 snakes every year — which ultimately die — in defiance of the law.
A report based on new research by the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI),
however, has strongly recommended that the traditional knowledge of the
snake charmers and skills be now utilised for education and medicine by
setting up sapera centres. This is mainly because the community has
virtually no access to land, education or employment opportunities. They
are dependent on snake charming to earn a livelihood. They trade around
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
124 / Beehive
as vendors of traditional medicine, snake catchers and musicians. Ignorance
about the law is quite common.
The report entitled ‘Biodiversity, Livelihoods and the Law: The Case of
the Jogi-Nath Snake Charmers of India’ based on path-breaking research
was formally released by the Inspector General of Forests, V.K. Bahuguna,
along with a presentation by members of the sapera community in the
Capital on Monday.
“Despite thirty years of the law being in existence, over 70 per cent of the
Jogi-Naths are still dependent on snake charming to earn a livelihood.
Ignorance about the law was quite common. None of them own land, even
though they would like to,’’ said Bahar Dutt, who led this research. Notably,
most of those practising the trade in the current generation are all under
35 years of age.
Trapping occurs throughout the year and during their travels, though
this activity increases during the monsoons. According to the data, each
family on an average collects at least seven snakes.
Most snakes were force-fed and snake husbandry methods and health
were found to be poor. “The snake charmers community council imposes a
heavy fine on a person if the snake dies in his custody as it is considered
an extremely bad omen. As a result, the snakes are released when the
charmers realise that their condition is deteriorating,’’ said Dutt. Their
ambition to showcase the reptiles and earn money was not fulfilled, as
they flouted four WPA provisions, for illegally possessing the animals, not
feeding them properly, causing injuries by extracting teeth unscientifically
and killing snakes for the valuable snake parts and bones. Their offence
generally invites imprisonment for three to seven years and a fine up to
Rs 25,000 in each case.
“On the positive side researchers found that the snake charmers possess
a unique ability to handle venomous snakes with a tremendous knowledge
of the different species and their behaviour. They are also called by local
farmers to retrieve snakes, who would otherwise just kill them, from
agricultural fields or human inhabited areas,’’ she said.

with sudden curvings of thin

and graceful are his shapes!
He glides through the water away
from the stroke. O let him go
over the water

without hurt. Small and green
he is harmless even to children.
Along the sand
he lay until observed

that are most sacred to Hindus and Buddhists.
At Pashupatinath (outside which a sign
proclaims ‘Entrance for the Hindus only’) there is
an atmosphere of ‘febrile confusion’. Priests,
hawkers, devotees, tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons
and dogs roam through the grounds. We offer a few
flowers. There are so many worshippers that some
people trying to get the priest’s attention are elbowed
aside by others pushing their way to the front. A
princess of the Nepalese royal house appears;
everyone bows and makes way. By the main gate, a
party of saffron-clad Westerners struggle for
permission to enter. The policeman is not convinced
that they are ‘the Hindus’ (only Hindus are allowed
to enter the temple). A fight breaks out between
two monkeys. One chases the other, who jumps
onto a shivalinga, then runs screaming around the
temples and down to the river, the holy Bagmati,

At the Baudhnath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of
Kathmandu, there is, in contrast, a sense of
stillness. Its immense white dome is ringed by a
road. Small shops stand on its outer edge: many of
these are owned by Tibetan immigrants; felt bags,
Tibetan prints and silver jewellery can be bought
here. There are no crowds: this is a haven of
quietness in the busy streets around.
Kathmandu is vivid, mercenary, religious, with
small shrines to flower-adorned deities along the
narrowest and busiest streets; with fruit sellers,
flute sellers, hawkers of postcards; shops selling
Western cosmetics, film rolls and chocolate; or
copper utensils and Nepalese antiques. Film songs

bells ring, stray cows low questioningly at
motorcycles, vendors shout out their wares. I indulge

myself mindlessly: buy a bar of marzipan, a corn-
on-the-cob roasted in a charcoal brazier on the
pavement (rubbed with salt, chilli powder and
lemon); a couple of love story comics, and even a
Reader’s Digest. All this I wash down with Coca Cola
and a nauseating orange drink, and feel much the
better for it.
I consider what route I should take back home.
If I were propelled by enthusiasm for travel per se,
I would go by bus and train to Patna, then sail up
the Ganges past Benaras to Allahabad, then up the
Yamuna, past Agra to Delhi. But I am too exhausted
and homesick; today is the last day of August. Go
home, I tell myself: move directly towards home. I
enter a Nepal Airlines office and buy a ticket for
tomorrow’s flight.
I look at the flute seller standing in a corner of
the square near the hotel. In his hand is a pole
with an attachment at the top from which fifty or
sixty bansuris protrude in all directions, like the
quills of a porcupine. They are of bamboo: there are
cross-flutes and recorders. From time to time he
stands the pole on the ground, selects a flute and
plays for a few minutes. The sound rises clearly
above the noise of the traffic and the hawkers’ cries.
He plays slowly, meditatively, without excessive
display. He does not shout out his wares.
Occasionally he makes a sale, but in a curiously
offhanded way as if this were incidental to his
enterprise. Sometimes he breaks off playing to talk
to the fruit seller. I imagine that this has been the
pattern of his life for years.
I find it difficult to tear myself away from the
square. Flute music always does this to me: it is at
once the most universal and most particular of
sounds. There is no culture that does not have its
flute — the reed neh, the recorder, the Japanese
shakuhachi, the deep bansuri of Hindustani classical
music, the clear or breathy flutes of South America,

the high-pitched Chinese flutes. Each has its
specific fingering and compass. It weaves its own
associations. Yet to hear any flute is, it seems to
me, to be drawn into the commonality of all
mankind, to be moved by music closest in its
phrases and sentences to the human voice. Its
motive force too is living breath: it too needs to
pause and breathe before it can go on.
That I can be so affected by a few familiar phrases
on the bansuri, surprises me at first, for on the
previous occasions that I have returned home after
a long absence abroad, I have hardly noticed such
details, and certainly have not invested them with
the significance I now do.

Study these sentences from the lesson.
A fight breaks out between two monkeys.
Film songs blare out from the radios.
I wash it down with Coca-Cola.
The italicised verbs are in the simple present tense. The writer is here describing
what he saw and heard but he uses the present tense instead of the past tense.
A narration or a story can be made more dramatic or immediate by using the
present tense in this way.
Now look at the following sentences.
A small shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the riverbank.
Small shops stand on the outer edge of the Stupa.
We use the simple present tense to speak about what is usually or generally
true. The sentences above describe facts. We also use the simple present tense
in sentences depicting ‘universal truths’. For example:
The sun rises in the east.
The earth revolves round the sun.
We can also refer to habitual actions using the simple present tense.
He usually takes a train instead of a bus to work.
We often get fine drizzles in winter.

This poem is about the death of a loved one. How does the
poet feel when he thinks about her death? How does he
imagine her to be, after death?
A slumber did my spirit seal—
I had no human fears.
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthy years.
No motion has she now, no force—
She neither hears nor sees,
Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course
With rocks and stones and trees.

“A slumber did my spirit seal,” says the poet. That is, a deep sleep ‘closed

he feel bitter grief ? Or does he feel a great peace?
The passing of time will no longer affect her, says the poet. Which lines of

✿ A small cottage interior. There is an entrance back right (which
may be curtained). Another door to the left must be a practical door. The
furniture is simple, consisting of a small table towards the left, a chair or
two, and a divan rather upstage on the right. On the table is a telephone.
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
(When the curtain rises Gerrard is standing by the table making a phone
call. He is of medium height, and wearing horn-rimmed glasses . . . He
is dressed in a lounge suit and a great coat. His voice is cultured.)
GERRARD :
... Well, tell him to phone up directly. I must know ...
Yes, I expect I’ll still be here, but you mustn’t count on
that ... In about ten minutes’ time. Right-ho. Goodbye.
(He puts down the phone and goes to the divan on the left, where there
is a travelling bag, and starts packing. Whilst he is thus engaged, another
man, similar in build to Gerrard enters from the right silently — revolver
in hand. He is flashily dressed in an overcoat and a soft hat. He bumps
accidentally against the table, and at the sound Gerrard turns quickly.)
GERRARD
(pleasantly) Why, this is a surprise, Mr— er —
INTRUDER
I’m glad you’re pleased to see me. I don’t think you’ll be
pleased for long. Put those paws up!
GERRARD
This is all very melodramatic, not very original, perhaps,
INTRUDER
Trying to be calm and — er—
GERRARD
‘Nonchalant’ is your word, I think.
INTRUDER
Thanks a lot. You’ll soon stop being smart. I’ll make you
crawl. I want to know a few things, see.
You’ll soon stop being smart. I’ll make you crawl.

GERRARD
Anything you like. I know all the answers. But before we
begin I should like to change my position; you may be
comfortable, but I am not.
INTRUDER
Sit down there, and no funny business. (Motions to a
chair, and seats himself on the divan by the bag.) Now
then, we’ll have a nice little talk about yourself!
GERRARD
At last a sympathetic audience! I’ll tell you the story of
my life. How as a child I was stolen by the gypsies, and
why at the age of thirty-two, I find myself in my lonely
Essex cottage, how ...
INTRUDER
Keep it to yourself, and just answer my questions. You
live here alone? Well, do you?
GERRARD
I’m sorry. I thought you were telling me, not asking me.
A question of inflection; your voice is unfamiliar.
INTRUDER
(with emphasis) Do you live here alone?
GERRARD
And if I don’t answer?
INTRUDER
You’ve got enough sense not to want to get hurt.
GERRARD
I think good sense is shown more in the ability to avoid
pain than in the mere desire to do so. What do you think,
Mr— er—
INTRUDER
Never mind my name. I like yours better, Mr Gerrard.
What are your Christian names?
GERRARD
Vincent Charles.
INTRUDER
Do you run a car?
GERRARD
INTRUDER
That’s a lie. You’re not dealing with a fool. I’m as smart
as you and smarter, and I know you run a car. Better be
careful, wise guy!
GERRARD
Are you American, or is that merely a clever imitation?
INTRUDER
Listen, this gun’s no toy. I can hurt you without killing
you, and still get my answers.
GERRARD
Of course, if you put it like that, I’ll be glad to assist you.
I do possess a car, and it’s in the garage round the corner.
INTRUDER
That’s better. Do people often come out here?
GERRARD
Very rarely. Surprisingly few people take the trouble to
visit me. There’s the baker and the greengrocer, of course;
and then there’s the milkman — quite charming, but no
one so interesting as yourself.
INTRUDER
I happen to know that you never see tradespeople.
www.zero2zenith.in

If I Were You / 141
GERRARD
You seem to have taken a considerable amount of trouble.
Since you know so much about me, won’t you say
something about yourself? You have been so modest.
INTRUDER
I could tell you plenty. You think you’re smart, but I’m
the top of the class round here. I’ve got brains and I use
them. That’s how I’ve got where I have.
GERRARD
And where precisely have you got? It didn’t require a
great brain to break into my little cottage.
INTRUDER
When you know why I’ve broken into your little cottage,
you’ll be surprised, and it won’t be a pleasant surprise.
GERRARD
With you figuring so largely in it, that is understandable.
By the way, what particular line of crime do you embrace,
or aren’t you a specialist?
INTRUDER
My speciality’s jewel robbery. Your car will do me a treat.
It’s certainly a dandy bus.
GERRARD
I’m afraid jewels are few and far between in the wilds of
Essex.
INTRUDER
So are the cops. I can retire here nicely for a little while.
GERRARD
You mean to live with me? A trifle sudden isn’t it; you’ve
not been invited.
INTRUDER
You won’t be here long; so I didn’t trouble to ask.
GERRARD
What do you mean?
INTRUDER
This is your big surprise. I’m going to kill you.
GERRARD
A little harsh, isn’t it?
INTRUDER
(with heavy sarcasm) Yeah, I’ll be sorry to do it. I’ve taken
a fancy to you, but it’s just got to be done.
GERRARD
Why add murder to your other crimes? It’s a grave step
you’re taking.
INTRUDER
I’m not taking it for fun. I’ve been hunted long enough.
I’m wanted for murder already, and they can’t hang me
twice.
GERRARD
You’re planning a gratuitous double, so to speak. Admitted
you’ve nothing to lose, but what have you to gain?
INTRUDER
I’ve got freedom to gain. As for myself, I’m a poor hunted
rat. As Vincent Charles Gerrard I’m free to go places and
do nothing. I can eat well and sleep and without having
to be ready to beat it at the sight of a cop.
GERRARD
In most melodramas the villain is foolish enough to delay
his killing long enough to be frustrated. You are much
luckier.

INTRUDER
I’m O.K. I’ve got a reason for everything. I’m going to be
Vincent Charles Gerrard, see. I’ve got to know what he
talks like. Now I know. That posh stuff comes easy. This
is Mr V.C. Gerrard speaking. (Pantomime of phoning, in
imitation cultured voice.) And that’s not all. (He stands
up.) Get up a minute (Gerrard stands.) Now take a look at
GERRARD
You’re not particularly decorative.
INTRUDER
No! Well, that goes for you, too. I’ve only got to wear
specs and I’ll be enough like you to get away with it.
GERRARD
What about your clothes? They’ll let you down if you’re
not careful.
INTRUDER
That’ll be all right. Yours will fit me fine.
GERRARD
That is extremely interesting, but you seem to miss the
point of my remark. I said, you were luckier than most
melodramatic villains. It was not a tribute to your
intelligence. You won’t kill me for a very good reason.
INTRUDER
So that’s what you think.
GERRARD
You’ll let me go, and thank God you didn’t shoot sooner.
INTRUDER
Come on. What’s on your mind! Better be quick. This
conversation bores me.
GERRARD
Your idea is to elude the police by killing me and taking
on my identity?
INTRUDER
Yes, I like the idea.
GERRARD
But are you sure it’s going to help you?
INTRUDER
Now listen here. I’ve got this all planned. I did a job in
town. Things went wrong and I killed a cop. Since then
I’ve done nothing but dodge.
GERRARD
And this is where dodging has brought you?
INTRUDER
It brought me to Aylesbury. That’s where I saw you in the
car. Two other people saw you and started to talk. I
listened. It looks like you’re a bit queer — kind of a mystery
GERRARD
A mystery which I propose to explain.
INTRUDER
(disregarding him) You phone your orders and sometimes
you go away suddenly and come back just the same.
Those are just the things I want to do. Hearing about you
was one of my luckiest breaks.
GERRARD
Apparently you haven’t the intelligence to ask why I am
invested in this cloak of mystery.
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
If I Were You / 143
INTRUDER
(preparing to shoot) As I said before, this conversation
bores me.
GERRARD
Don’t be a fool. If you shoot, you’ll hang for sure. If not as
yourself, then as Vincent Charles Gerrard.
INTRUDER
What is this?
GERRARD
This is your big surprise. I said you wouldn’t kill me and
I was right. Why do you think I am here today and gone
tomorrow, never see tradespeople? You say my habits
would suit you. You are a crook. Do you think I am a
Sunday-school teacher?
The game’s up as far as I’m concerned. Things went
wrong with me. I said it with bullets and got away.
Unfortunately they got one of my men, and found things
the fool should have burnt. Tonight I’m expecting trouble.
My bag’s packed ready to clear off. There it is.
INTRUDER
It’s a bag all right and
this is a gun all right.
What’s all this?
GERRARD
That’s a disguise outfit;
false moustaches and
what not. Now do you
believe me?
INTRUDER
(musingly) I don’t know.
GERRARD
For God’s sake clear
that muddled head of
yours and let’s go.
Come with me in the
car. I can use you. If you
find it’s a frame, you’ve
got me in the car, and
you’ve still got your gun.
INTRUDER
May be you’re right.
GERRARD
Then don’t waste time.
(Goes and picks up hat
and bag.)
INTRUDER
Careful,
boss,
watching you.
GERRARD
I have got a man posted
on the main road. He’ll
ring up if he sees the
Gerrard gives him a push
into the cupboard ...
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
144 / Beehive
police, but I don’t want to leave ... (telephone bell rings)
Come on! They’re after us. Through here straight to
the garage.
INTRUDER
How do I know that you are telling the truth?
GERRARD
Oh, don’t be a fool. Look for yourself.
(Gerrard opens door and steps away. Intruder leans forward
to inspect it, with his side towards Gerrard, but with the
revolver ready. As he turns his head, Gerrard gives him a
push into the cupboard, knocking the revolver out of his
hand. He slams the door and locks it, picks up the revolver
and goes to the phone, where he stands with the gun pointed
at the cupboard door.)
INTRUDER
(rattles door and shouts) Let me out of here!
GERRARD
Hello. Yes, speaking. Sorry I can’t let you have the props
in time for rehearsal, I’ve had a spot of bother — quite
amusing. I think I’ll put it in my next play. Listen, can
you tell our friend the Sergeant to come up here at once?
You’ll probably find him in the Public Bar.
DOUGLAS JAMES
I. Answer these questions.
“At last a sympathetic audience.”
(i) Who says this?
(ii) Why does he say it?
(iii) Is he sarcastic or serious?
Why does the intruder choose Gerrard as the man whose identity he wants
to take on?
“I said it with bullets.”
(i) Who says this?
(ii) What does it mean?
(iii) Is it the truth? What is the speaker’s reason for saying this?
What is Gerrard’s profession? Quote the parts of the play that support your
answer.
“You’ll soon stop being smart.”
(i) Who says this?
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
If I Were You / 145
(ii) Why does the speaker say it?
(iii) What according to the speaker will stop Gerrard from being smart?
“They can’t hang me twice.”
(i) Who says this?
(ii) Why does the speaker say it?
“A mystery I propose to explain.” What is the mystery the speaker proposes
to explain?
“This is your big surprise.”
(i) Where has this been said in the play?
(ii) What is the surprise?
I. Consult your dictionary and choose the correct word from the pairs given in
brackets.
The (site, cite) of the accident was (ghastly/ghostly).
Our college (principle/principal) is very strict.
I studied (continuously/continually) for eight hours.
The fog had an adverse (affect/effect) on the traffic.
Cezanne, the famous French painter, was a brilliant (artist/artiste).
The book that you gave me yesterday is an extraordinary (collage/college) of
science fiction and mystery.
Our school will (host/hoist) an exhibition on cruelty to animals and wildlife
conservation.
Screw the lid tightly onto the top of the bottle and (shake/shape) well before
using the contents.
II. Irony is when we say one thing but mean another, usually the opposite of what
we say. When someone makes a mistake and you say, “Oh! that was clever!”,
that is  irony. You’re saying ‘clever‘ to mean ‘not clever’.
Expressions we often use in an ironic fashion are:
Oh, wasn’t that clever!/Oh that was clever!
You have been a great help, I must say!
You’ve got yourself into a lovely mess, haven’t you?
Oh, very funny!/ How funny!
We use a slightly different tone of voice when we use these words ironically.
Read the play carefully and find the words and expressions Gerrard uses in an
ironic way. Then say what these expressions really mean. Two examples have
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
146 / Beehive
been given below. Write down three more such expressions along with what
they really mean.
What the author says
What he means
Why, this is a surprise, Mr —er —
He pretends that the intruder is a
social visitor whom he is welcoming.
In this way he hides his fear.
At last a sympathetic audience!
He pretends that the intruder wants
to listen to him, whereas actually
the intruder wants to find out
information for his own use.
A word can mean different things in different contexts. Look at these three
sentences:
The students are taught to respect different cultures.
The school is organising a cultural show.
His voice is cultured.
In the first sentence, ‘culture’ (noun) means way of life; in the second, ‘cultural’
(adjective) means connected with art, literature and music; and in the third,
‘cultured’ (verb) means sophisticated, well mannered. Usually a dictionary helps
you identify the right meaning by giving you signposts.
Look at the dictionary entry on ‘culture’ from Oxford Advanced Learner’s
Dictionary, 2005.
www.zero2zenith.in
www.zero2zenith.in
If I Were You / 147
(Noun, verb, adjective, adverb, synonyms, etc. are signposts which help you
locate the right meaning and usage, and give information about the part of
speech that the word is.)
Look up the dictionary entries for the words sympathy, familiarity, comfort, care,
and surprise. Use the information given in the dictionary and complete the table.

Imagine you are Gerrard. Tell your friend what happened when the Intruder
broke into your house.
[Clues : Describe (i) the intruder — his appearance, the way he spoke, his
plan, his movements, etc., (ii) how you outwitted him.]
Enact the play in the class. Pay special attention to words given in italics
before a dialogue. These words will tell you whether the dialogue has to be
said in a happy, sarcastic or ironic tone and how the characters move and
what they do as they speak. Read these carefully before you enact the play.
I. Which of the words below describe Gerrard and which describe the Intruder?
smart
humorous
clever
beautiful
confident
flashy
witty
nonchalant
Write a paragraph each about Gerrard and the Intruder to show what qualities
they have. (You can use some of the words given above.)
II. Convert the play into a story (150 –200 words). Your story should be as exciting
and as witty as the play. Provide a suitable title to it.
