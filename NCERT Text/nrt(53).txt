THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance
of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-
centered system of education outlined in the National Policy of
Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and
questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom,
children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information
passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the
sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources
and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative
is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in
learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and
mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary
as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a
happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus
designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by
restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by
giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation
and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring
hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the
Chairperson of the advisory group in Social Sciences, at the higher
secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for

committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are
grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the
institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon
their resources, materials and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members
of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary

Introduction
1.1 A SIMPLE ECONOMY
Think of any society. People in the society need many goods and
services1 in their everyday life including food, clothing, shelter,
transport facilities like roads and railways, postal services and
various other services like that of teachers and doctors. In fact, the
list of goods and services that any individual2 needs is so large that
no individual in society, to begin with, has all the things she needs.
Every individual has some amount of only a few of the goods and
services that she would like to use. A family farm may own a plot of
land, some grains, farming implements, maybe a pair of bullocks
and also the labour services of the family members. A weaver may
have some yarn, some cotton and other instruments required for
weaving cloth. The teacher in the local school has the skills required
to impart education to the students. Some others in society may
not have any resource3 excepting their own labour services. Each of
these decision making units can produce some goods or services
by using the resources that it has and use part of the produce to
obtain the many other goods and services which it needs. For
example, the family farm can produce corn, use part of the produce
for consumption purposes and procure clothing, housing and
various services in exchange for the rest of the produce. Similarly,
the weaver can get the goods and services that she wants in exchange
for the cloth she produces in her yarn. The teacher can earn some
money by teaching students in the school and use the money for
obtaining the goods and services that she wants. The labourer also
can try to fulfill her needs by using whatever money she can earn by
working for someone else. Each individual can thus use her
resources to fulfill her needs. It goes without saying that no
individual has unlimited resources compared to her needs. The
amount of corn that the family farm can produce is limited by the
amount of resources it has, and hence, the amount of different goods
1By goods we means physical, tangible objects used to satisfy people’s wants and needs. The
term ‘goods’ should be contrasted with the term ‘services’, which captures the intangible satisfaction
of wants and needs. As compared to food items and clothes, which are examples of goods, we can
think of the tasks that doctors and teachers perform for us as examples of services.
2By individual, we mean an individual decision making unit. A decision making unit can be a
single person or a group like a household, a firm or any other organisation.
3By resource, we mean those goods and services which are used to produce other goods and
services, e.g. land, labour, tools and machinery, etc.

Introductory Microeconomics
and services that it can procure in exchange of corn is also limited. As a result, the
family is forced to make a choice between the different goods and services that are
available. It can have more of a good or service only by giving up some amounts of
other goods or services. For example, if the family wants to have a bigger house, it
may have to give up the idea of having a few more acres of arable land. If it wants
more and better education for the children, it may have to give up some of the
luxuries of life. The same is the case with all other individuals in society. Everyone
faces scarcity of resources, and therefore, has to use the limited resources in the
best possible way to fulfill her needs.
In general, every individual in society is engaged in the production of some
goods or services and she wants a combination of many goods and services not
all of which are produced by her. Needless to say that there has to be some
compatibility between what people in society collectively want to have and what
they produce4. For example, the total amount of corn produced by family farm
along with other farming units in a society must match the total amount of corn
that people in the society collectively want to consume. If people in the society
do not want as much corn as the farming units are capable of producing
collectively, a part of the resources of these units could have been used in the
production of some other good or services which is in high demand. On the
other hand, if people in the society want more corn compared to what the farming
units are producing collectively, the resources used in the production of some
other goods and services may be reallocated to the production of corn. Similar is
the case with all other goods or services. Just as the resources of an individual
are scarce, the resources of the society are also scarce in comparison to what the
people in the society might collectively want to have. The scarce resources of the
society have to be allocated properly in the production of different goods and
services in keeping with the likes and dislikes of the people of the society.
Any allocation5 of resources of the society would result in the production of a
particular combination of  different goods and services. The goods and services
thus produced will have to be distributed among the individuals of the society.
The allocation of the limited resources and the distribution of the final mix of goods
and services are two of the basic economic problems faced by the society.
In reality, any economy is much more complex compared to the society
discussed above. In the light of what we have learnt about the society, let us now
discuss the fundamental concerns of the discipline of economics some of which
we shall study throughout this book.
1.2 CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF AN ECONOMY
Production, exchange and consumption of goods and services are among the
basic economic activities of life. In the course of these basic economic activities,
every society has to face scarcity of resources and it is the scarcity of resources
that gives rise to the problem of choice. The scarce resources of an economy
have competing usages. In other words, every society has to decide on how to
use its scarce resources. The problems of an economy are very often summarised
as follows:
4Here we assume that all the goods and services produced in a society are consumed by the people
in the society and that there is no scope of getting anything from outside the society. In reality, this
is not true. However, the general point that is being made here about the compatibility of production
and consumption of goods and services holds for any country or even for the entire world.
5By an allocation of the resources, we mean how much of which resource is devoted to the
production of each of the goods and services.

Introduction
What is produced and in what quantities?
Every society must decide on how much of each of the many possible goods and
services it will produce. Whether to produce more of food, clothing, housing or
to have more of luxury goods. Whether to have more agricultural goods or to
have industrial products and services. Whether to use more resources in education
and health or to use more resources in building military services. Whether to
have more of basic education or more of higher education. Whether to have
more of consumption goods or to have investment goods (like machine) which
will boost production and consumption tomorrow.
How are these goods produced?
Every society has to decide on how much of which of the resources to use in the
production of each of the different goods and services. Whether to use more
labour or more machines. Which of the available technologies to adopt in the
production of each of the goods?
For whom are these goods produced?
Who gets how much of the goods that are produced in the economy? How should
the produce of the economy be distributed among the individuals in the economy?
Who gets more and who gets less? Whether or not to ensure a minimum amount
of consumption for everyone in the economy. Whether or not elementary education
and basic health services should be available freely for everyone in the economy.
Thus, every economy faces the problem of allocating the scarce resources to
the production of different possible goods and services and of distributing the
produced goods and services among the individuals within the economy. The
allocation of scarce resources and the distribution of the final goods and
services are the central problems of any economy.
Production Possibility Frontier
Just as individuals face scarcity of resources, the resources of an economy
as a whole are always limited in comparison to what the people in the
economy collectively want to have. The scarce resources have alternative
usages and every society has to decide on how much of each of the resources
to use in the production of different goods and services. In other words,
every society has to determine how to allocate its scarce resources to different
goods and services.
An allocation of the scarce resource of the economy gives rise to a
particular combination of different goods and services. Given the total amount
of resources, it is possible to allocate the resources in many different ways
and, thereby achieving different mixes of all possible goods and services. The
collection of all possible combinations of the goods and services that can be
produced from a given amount of resources and a given stock of technological
knowledge is called the production possibility set of the economy.
EXAMPLE
Consider an economy which
can produce corn or cotton
by using its resources.
Table 1.1 gives some of the
combinations of corn and
cotton that the economy can
produce.
Table1.1: Production Possibilities
Possibilities
Cotton

Introductory Microeconomics
If all the resources are used in the production of corn, the maximum
amount of corn that can be produced is 4 units and if all resources are
used in the production of cotton, at the most, 10 units of cotton can be
produced. The economy can also produce1 unit of corn and 9 units of
cotton or 2 units of corn and 7 units of cotton or 3 units of corn and 4
units of cotton. There can be many other possibilities. The figure illustrates
the production possibilities of the economy. Any point on or below the
curve represents a combination of corn and cotton that can be produced
with the economy’s resources. The curve gives the maximum amount of
corn that can be produced in the economy for any given amount of cotton
and vice-versa. This curve is called the production possibility frontier.
The production possibility frontier
gives the combinations of corn and
cotton that can be produced when
the resources of the economy are fully
utilised. Note that a point lying
strictly below the production
possibility frontier represents a
combination of corn and cotton
that will be produced when all or
some of the resources are either
underemployed or are utilised in a
wasteful fashion.
If more of the scarce resources are used in the production of corn,
less resources are available for the production of cotton and vice versa.
Therefore, if we want to have more of one of the goods, we will have
less of the other good. Thus, there is always a cost of having a little
more of one good in terms of the amount of the other good that has to
be forgone. This is known as the opportunity costa of an additional
unit of the goods.
Every economy has to choose one of the many possibilities that it
has. In other words, one of the central problems of the economy is to
choose from one of the many production possibilities.
aNote that the concept of opportunity cost is applicable to the individual as well as the
society. The concept is very important and is widely used in economics. Because of its
importance in economics, sometimes, opportunity cost is also called the economic cost.
1.3 ORGANISATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
Basic problems can be solved either by the free interaction of the individuals
pursuing their own objectives as is done in the market or in a planned manner
by some central authority like the government.
1.3.1 The Centrally Planned Economy
In a centrally planned economy, the government or the central authority plans
all the important activities in the economy. All important decisions regarding
production, exchange and consumption of goods and services are made by the
government. The central authority may try to achieve a particular allocation of
resources and a consequent distribution of the final combination of goods and
services which is thought to be desirable for society as a whole. For example, if it
is found that a good or service which is very important for the prosperity and
Cotton

Introduction
well-being of the economy as a whole, e.g. education or health service, is not
produced in adequate amount by the individuals on their own, the government
might try to induce the individuals to produce adequate amount of such a good
or service or, alternatively, the government may itself decide to produce the good
or service in question. In a different context, if some people in the economy get
so little a share of the final mix of goods and services produced in the economy
that their survival is at stake, then the central authority may intervene and try
to achieve an equitable distribution of the final mix of goods and services.
1.3.2 The Market Economy
In contrast to a centrally planned economy, in a market economy, all economic
activities are organised through the market. A market, as studied in economics,
is an institution6 which organises the free interaction of individuals pursuing
their respective economic activities. In other words, a market is a set of
arrangements where economic agents can freely exchange their endowments or
products with each other. It is important to note that the term ‘market’ as used
in economics is quite different from the common sense understanding of a
market. In particular, it has nothing as such to do with the marketplace as you
might tend to think of. For buying and selling commodities, individuals may or
may not meet each other in an actual physical location. Interaction between
buyers and sellers can take place in a variety of situations such as a village-
chowk or a super bazaar in a city, or alternatively, buyers and sellers can interact
with each other through telephone or internet and conduct the exchange of
commodities. The arrangements which allow people to buy and sell commodities
freely are the defining features of a market.
For the smooth functioning of any system, it is imperative that there is
coordination in the activities of the different constituent parts of the system.
Otherwise, there can be chaos. You may wonder as to what are the forces which
bring the coordination between the activities of millions of isolated individuals
in a market system.
In a market system, all goods or services come with a price (which is mutually
agreed upon by the buyers and sellers) at which the exchanges take place. The
price reflects, on an average, the society’s valuation of the good or service in
question. If the buyers demand more of a certain good, the price of that good
will rise. This will send a signal to the producer of that good to the effect that the
society as a whole wants more of that good than is currently being produced
and the producers of the good, in their turn, are likely to increase their production.
In this way, prices of goods and services send important information to all the
individuals across the market and help achieve coordination in a market system.
Thus, in a market system, the central problems regarding how much and what
to produce are solved through the coordination of economic activities brought
about by the price signals.
In reality, all economies are mixed economies where some important
decisions are taken by the government and the economic activities are by and
large conducted through the market. The only difference is in terms of the
extent of the role of the government in deciding the course of economic activities.
In the United States of America, the role of the government is minimal. The
closest example of a centrally planned economy is the Soviet Union for the
major part of the twentieth century. In India, since Independence, the
government has played a major role in planning economic activities. However,
6An institution is usually defined as an organisation with some purpose.

the role of the government in the Indian economy has been reduced considerably
in the last couple of decades.
1.4  POSITIVE AND NORMATIVE ECONOMICS
It was mentioned earlier that in principle there are more than one ways of
solving the central problems of an economy. These different mechanisms in
general are likely to give rise to different solutions to those problems, thereby
resulting in different allocations of the resources and also different distributions
of the final mix of goods and services produced in the economy. Therefore, it is
important to understand which of these alternative mechanisms is more
desirable for the economy as a whole. In economics, we try to analyse the
different mechanisms and figure out the outcomes which are likely to result
under each of these mechanisms. We also try to evaluate the mechanisms by
studying how desirable the outcomes resulting from them are. Often a
distinction is made between positive economic analysis and normative
economic analysis depending on whether we are trying to figure out how a
particular mechanism functions or we are trying to evaluate it. In positive
economic analysis, we study how the different mechanisms function, and in
normative economics, we try to understand whether these mechanisms are
desirable or not. However, this distinction between positive and normative
economic analysis is not a very sharp one. The positive and the normative
issues involved in the study of the central economic problems are very closely
related to each other and a proper understanding of one is not possible in
isolation to the other.
1.5  MICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS
Traditionally, the subject matter of economics has been studied under two broad
branches: Microeconomics and Macroeconomics. In microeconomics, we study
the behaviour of individual economic agents in the markets for different goods
and services and try to figure out how prices and quantities of goods and services
are determined through the interaction of individuals in these markets. In
macroeconomics, on the other hand, we try to get an understanding of the
economy as a whole by focusing our attention on aggregate measures such as
total output, employment and aggregate price level. Here, we are interested in
finding out how the levels of these aggregate measures are determined and how
the levels of these aggregate measures change over time. Some of the important
questions that are studied in microeconomics are as follows: What is the level of
total output in the economy? How is the total output determined? How does the
total output grow over time? Are the resources of the economy (eg labour) fully
employed? What are the reasons behind the unemployment of resources? Why
do prices rise? Thus, instead of studying the different markets as is done in
microeconomics, in macroeconomics, we try to study the behaviour of aggregate
or macro measures of the performance of the economy.
1.6  PLAN OF THE BOOK
This book is meant to introduce you to the basic ideas in microeconomics. In
this book, we will focus on the behaviour of the individual consumers and
producers of a single commodity and try to analyse how the price and the
quantity is determined in the market for a single commodity. In Chapter 2, we

Consumer Behaviour
In this chapter, we will study the behaviour of an individual
consumer in a market for final goods1. The consumer has to decide
on how much of each of the different goods she would like to
consume. Our objective here is to study this choice problem in
some detail. As we see, the choice of the consumer depends on the
alternatives that are available to her and on her tastes and
preferences regarding those alternatives. To begin with, we will
try to figure out a precise and convenient way of describing the
available alternatives and also the tastes and preferences of the
consumer. We will then use these descriptions to find out the
consumer’s choice in the market.
Preliminary Notations and Assumptions
A consumer, in general, consumes many goods; but for simplicity,
we shall consider the consumer’s choice problem in a situation
where there are only two goods.2 We will refer to the two goods as
good 1 and good 2. Any combination of the amount of the two
goods will be called a consumption bundle or, in short, a bundle.
In general, we shall use the variable x1 to denote the amount of
good 1 and x2 to denote the amount of good 2. x1 and x2 can be
positive or zero. (x1, x2) would mean the bundle consisting of x1
amount of good 1 and x2 amount of good 2. For particular values
of x1 and x2, (x1, x2), would give us a particular bundle. For
example, the bundle (5,10) consists of 5 units of good 1 and 10
units of good 2; the bundle (10, 5) consists of 10 units of good 1
and 5 units of good 2.
2.1 THE CONSUMER’S BUDGET
Let us consider a consumer who has only a fixed amount of money
(income) to spend on two goods the prices of which are given in the
market. The consumer cannot buy any and every combination of
the two goods that she may want to consume. The consumption
bundles that are available to the consumer depend on the prices of
the two goods and the income of the consumer. Given her fixed

2The assumption that there are only two goods simplifies the analysis considerably and allows us
to understand some important concepts by using simple diagrams.

income and the prices of the two goods, the consumer can afford to buy only
those bundles which cost her less than or equal to her income.
2.1.1 Budget Set
Suppose the income of the consumer is M and the prices of the two goods are p1
and p2 respectively.3 If the consumer wants to buy x1 units of good 1, she will
have to spend p1x1 amount of money. Similarly, if the consumer wants to buy x2
units of good 2, she will have to spend p2x2 amount of money. Therefore, if the
consumer wants to buy the bundle consisting of x1 units of good 1 and x2 units
of good 2, she will have to spend p1x1 + p2x2 amount of money. She can buy this
bundle only if she has at least p1x1 + p2x2 amount of money. Given the prices of
the goods and the income of a consumer, she can choose any bundle as long as
it costs less than or equal to the income she has. In other words, the consumer
can buy any bundle (x1, x2) such that
p1x1 + p2x2 ≤ M
(2.1)
The inequality (2.1) is called the consumer’s budget constraint. The set of
bundles available to the consumer is called the budget set. The budget set is
thus the collection of all bundles that the consumer can buy with her income at
the prevailing market prices.
EXAMPLE
Consider, for example, a consumer who has Rs 20, and suppose, both the goods
are priced at Rs 5 and are available only in integral units. The bundles that this
consumer can afford to buy are: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1),
(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1) and (4, 0). Among these bundles,
(0, 4), (1,3), (2, 2), (3, 1) and (4, 0) cost exactly Rs 20 and all the other bundles
cost less than Rs 20. The consumer cannot afford to buy bundles like (3, 3) and
(4, 5) because they cost more than Rs 20 at the prevailing prices.
3Price of a good is the amount of money that the consumer has to pay per unit of the good she
wants to buy. If rupee is the unit of money and quantity of the good is measured in kilograms, the
price of good 1 being p1 means the consumer has to pay p1 rupees per kilograms of good 1 that she
wants to buy.

2.1.2 Budget Line
If both the goods are perfectly
divisible4, the consumer’s budget set
would consist of all bundles (x1, x2)
such that x1 and x2 are any numbers
greater than or equal to 0 and p1x1 +
p2x2 ≤ M. The budget set can be
represented in a diagram as in
Figure 2.1.
All bundles in the positive
quadrant which are on or below the
line are included in the budget set.
The equation of the line is
p1x1 + p2x2 = M
(2.2)
The line consists of all bundles which
cost exactly equal to M. This line is
called the budget line. Points below
the budget line represent bundles which cost strictly less than M.
The equation (2.2) can also be written as5
(2.3)
The budget line is a straight line with horizontal intercept
p  and vertical
intercept
p . The horizontal intercept represents the bundle that the consumer
can buy if she spends her entire income on good 1. Similarly, the vertical intercept
represents the bundle that the consumer can buy if she spends her entire income
on good 2. The slope of the budget line is
Budget Set. Quantity of good 1 is measured
along the horizontal axis and quantity of good 2
is measured along the vertical axis. Any point in
the diagram represents a bundle of the two
goods. The budget set consists of all points on
or below the straight line having the equation
p1x1 + p2x2 = M.
4The goods considered in Example 2.1 were not divisible and were available only in integer units.
There are many goods which are divisible in the sense that they are available in non-integer units
also. It is not possible to buy half an orange or one-fourth of a banana, but it is certainly possible to
buy half a kilogram of rice or one-fourth of a litre of milk.
5In school mathematics, you have learnt the equation of a straight line as y = c + mx where c is the
vertical intercept and m is the  slope of the straight line. Note that equation (2.3) has the same form.
Derivation of the Slope of the Budget Line
The slope of the budget line measures
the amount of change in good 2
required per unit of change in good
1 along the budget line. Consider any
two points (x1, x2) and (x1 + Δx1, x2 +
Δx2) on the budget line.a
It must be the case that
p1x1 + p2x2 = M
(2.4) and
p1(x1 + Δx1) + p2(x2 + Δx2) = M

Theory of Consumer Behaviour
Price Ratio and the Slope of the Budget Line
Think of any point on the budget line. Such a point represents a bundle which
costs the consumer her entire budget. Now suppose the consumer wants to have
one more unit of good 1. She can do it only if she gives up some amount of the
other good. How much of good 2 does she have to give up if she wants to have an
extra unit of good 1? It would depend on the prices of the two goods. A unit of
good 1 costs p1. Therefore, she will have to reduce her expenditure on good 2 by
p1 amount. With p1, she could buy
units of good 2. Therefore, if the consumer
wants to have an extra unit of good 1 when she is spending all her money, she will
have to give up
units of good 2. In other words, in the given market conditions,
the consumer can substitute good 1 for good 2 at the rate
. The absolute
value6 of the slope of the budget line measures the rate at which the consumer is
able to substitute good 1 for good 2 when she spends her entire budget.
Points Below the Budget Line
Consider any point below the budget line. Such a point represents a bundle
which costs less than the consumer’s income. Thus, if the consumer buys such
a bundle, she will have some money left
over. In principle, the consumer could
spend this extra money on either of the
two goods, and thus, buy a bundle
which consists of more of, at least, one
of the goods, and no less of the other
as compared to the bundle lying below
the budget line. In other words,
compared to a point below the budget
line, there is always some bundle on
the budget line which contains more of
at least one of the goods and no less of
the other. Figure 2.2 illustrates this
fact. The point C lies below the budget
line while points A and B lie on the
budget line. Point A contains more of
good 2 and the same amount of good
Subtracting (2.4) from (2.5), we obtain

aΔ (delta) is a Greek letter. In mathematics, Δ is sometimes used to denote ‘a change’.
Thus, Δx1 stands for a change in x1 and Δx2 stands for a change in x2.

value of x is usually denoted by |x|.

of good 2 as compared to point C. Any other point on the line segment ‘AB’
represents a bundle which has more of both the goods compared to C.
2.1.3 Changes in the Budget Set
The set of available bundles depends on the prices of the two goods and the income
of the consumer. When the price of either of the goods or the consumer’s income
changes, the set of available bundles is also likely to change. Suppose the
consumer’s income changes from M to M′ but the prices of the two goods remain
unchanged. With the new income, the consumer can afford to buy all bundles
(x1, x2) such that p1x1 + p2x2 ≤ M′. Now the equation of the budget line is
p1x1 + p2x2 = M′
(2.8)
Equation (2.8) can also be written as
(2.9)
Note that the slope of the new budget line is the same as the slope of the
budget line prior to the change in the consumer’s income. However, the vertical
intercept has changed after the change in income. If there is an increase in the
income, i.e. if M' > M, the vertical intercept increases, there is a parallel outward
shift of the budget line. If the income increases, the consumer can buy more of
the goods at the prevailing market prices. Similarly, if the income goes down, i.e.
if M' < M, the vertical intercept decreases, and hence, there is a parallel inward
shift of the budget line. If income goes down, the availability of goods goes
down. Changes in the set of available bundles resulting from changes in
consumer’s income when the prices of the two goods remain unchanged are
shown in Figure 2.3.
Now suppose the price of good 1 changes from p1 to p'1 but the price of good
2 and the consumer’s income remain unchanged. At the new price of good 1,
the consumer can afford to buy all bundles (x1,x2) such that p'1x1 + p2x2 ≤ M. The
equation of the budget line is
p'1x1 + p2x2 = M

Changes in the Set of Available Bundles of Goods Resulting from Changes in the
Price of Good 1. An increase in the price of good 1 makes the budget line steeper as in
panel (a). A decrease in the price of good 1 makes the budget line flatter as in panel (b).
Equation (2.10) can also be written as
(2.11)
Note that the vertical intercept of the new budget line is the same as the
vertical intercept of the budget line prior to the change in the price of good 1.
However, the slope of the budget line has changed after the price change. If the
price of good 1 increases, ie if p'1> p1, the absolute value of the slope of the
budget line increases, and the budget line becomes steeper (it pivots inwards
around the vertical intercept). If the price of good 1 decreases,
i.e., p'1< p1, the absolute value of the slope of the budget line decreases and
hence, the budget line becomes flatter (it pivots outwards around the vertical
intercept). Changes in the set of available bundles resulting from changes in
the price of good 1 when the price of good 2 and the consumer’s income remain
unchanged are represented in Figure 2.4.
A change in price of good 2, when price of good 1 and the consumer’s income
remain unchanged, will bring about similar changes in the budget set of the
consumer.
2.2 PREFERENCES OF THE CONSUMER
The budget set consists of all bundles that are available to the consumer. The
consumer can choose her consumption bundle from the budget set. But on
what basis does she choose her consumption bundle from the ones that are
available to her? In economics, it is assumed that the consumer chooses her
consumption bundle on the basis of her tastes and preferences over the bundles
in the budget set. It is generally assumed that the consumer has well-defined
preferences over the set of all possible bundles. She can compare any two
bundles. In other words, between any two bundles, she either prefers one to the
other or she is indifferent between the two. Furthermore, it is assumed that the
consumer can rank7 the bundles in order of her preferences over them.
7The simplest example of a ranking is the ranking of all students according to the marks obtained
by each in the last annual examination.

2.2.1 Monotonic Preferences
Consumer’s preferences are assumed to be such that between any two bundles
(x1, x2) and (y1, y2), if (x1, x2) has more of at least one of the goods and no less of
the other good compared to (y1, y2), then the consumer prefers (x1, x2) to (y1, y2).
Preferences of this kind are called monotonic preferences. Thus, a consumer’s
preferences are monotonic if and only if between any two bundles, the consumer
prefers the bundle which has more of at least one of the goods and no less of the
other good as compared to the other bundle.
EXAMPLE
For example, consider the bundle (2, 2). This bundle has more of both goods
compared to (1, 1); it has equal amount of good 1 but more of good 2 compared
to the bundle (2, 1) and compared to (1, 2), it has more of good 1 and equal
amount of good 2. If a consumer has monotonic preferences, she would prefer
the bundle (2, 2) to all the three bundles (1, 1), (2, 1) and (1, 2).
2.2.2 Substitution between Goods
Consider two bundles such that one bundle has more of the first good as
compared to the other bundle. If the consumer’s preferences are monotonic,
these two bundles can be indifferent only if the bundle having more of the
first good has less of good 2 as compared to the other bundle. Suppose a
EXAMPLE
Consider the consumer of Example 2.1. Suppose the preferences of the consumer
over the set of bundles that are available to her are as follows:
The consumer’s most preferred bundle is (2, 2).
She is indifferent to (1, 3) and (3, 1). She prefers both these bundles compared
to any other bundle except (2, 2).
She is indifferent to (1, 2) and (2, 1). She prefers both these bundles compared
to any other bundle except (2, 2), (1, 3) and (3, 1).
The consumer is indifferent to any bundle which has only one of the goods
and the bundle (0, 0). A bundle having positive amounts of both goods is preferred
to a bundle having only one of the goods.
The bundles that are available to this consumer can be ranked from the best
to the least preferred according to her preferences. Any two (or more) indifferent
bundles obtain the same rank while the preferred bundles are ranked higher.
The ranking is presented in the Table 2.1.

Theory of Consumer Behaviour
consumer is indifferent between two bundles (x1, x2) and (x1 + Δx1, x2 + Δx2).
Monotonicity of preferences implies that if Δx1 > 0 then Δx2 < 0, and if
Δx1 < 0 then Δx2 > 0; the consumer can move from (x1, x2) to (x1 + Δx1, x2+Δx2)
by substituting one good for the other. The rate of substitution between
good 2 and good 1 is given by the absolute value of
. The rate of
substitution is the amount of good 2 that the consumer is willing to give up
for an extra unit of good 1. It measures the consumer’s willingness to pay for
good 1 in terms of good 2. Thus, the rate of substitution between the two
goods captures a very important aspect of the consumer’s preference.
EXAMPLE
Suppose a consumer is indifferent to the bundles (1, 2) and (2, 1). At (1, 2), the
consumer is willing to give up 1 unit of good 2 if she gets 1 extra unit of good 1.
Thus, the rate of substitution between good 2 and good 1 is 1.
2.2.3 Diminishing Rate of Substitution
The consumer’s preferences are assumed to be such that she has more of good
1 and less of good 2, the amount of good 2 that she would be willing to give up
for an additional unit of good 1 would go down. The consumer’s willingness to
pay for good 1 in terms of good 2 would go on declining as she has more and
more of good 1. In other words, as the amount of good 1 increases, the rate of
substitution between good 2 and good 1 diminishes. Preferences of this kind
are called convex preferences.
2.2.4 Indifference Curve
A consumer’s preferences over the
set of available bundles can often be
represented diagrammatically. We
have already seen that the bundles
available to the consumer can be
plotted as points in a two-
dimensional diagram. The points
representing bundles which are
considered indifferent by the
consumer can generally be joined to
obtain a curve like the one in Figure
2.5. Such a curve joining all points
representing bundles among which
the consumer is indifferent is called
an indifference curve.
Consider a point above the  indifference curve. Such a point has more of at
least one of the goods and no less of the other good as compared to at least one
point on the indifference curve. Consider the Figure 2.6. The point C lies above
the indifference curve while points A and B lie on the indifference curve. Point
C contains more of good 1 and the same amount of good 2 as compared to A.
Compared to point B, C contains more of good 2 and the same amount of good
1. And it has more of both the goods compared to any other point on the
segment AB of the indifference curve. If preferences are monotonic, the bundle
represented by the point C would be preferred to bundles represented by points

on the segment AB, and hence, it
would be preferred to all bundles
on the indifference curve. Therefore,
monotonicity of preferences implies
that any point above the indifference
curve represents a bundle which is
preferred to the bundles on the
indifference curve. By a similar
argument, it can be established that
if the consumer’s preferences are
monotonic, any point below the
indifference curve represents a
bundle which is inferior to the
bundles on the indifference curve.
Figure 2.6 depicts the bundles that
are preferred and the bundles that
are inferior to the bundles on an
indifference curve.
2.2.5 Shape of the Indifference Curve
The Rate of Substitution and the Slope of the Indifference Curve
Think of any two points (x1, x2) and (x1 + Δx1, x2 + Δx2) on the indifference
curve. Consider a movement from (x1, x2) to (x1 + Δx1, x2 + Δx2) along the
indifference curve. The slope of the straight line joining these two points gives
the change in the amount of good 2 corresponding to a unit change in good
1 along the indifference curve. Thus, the absolute value of the slope of the
straight line joining these two points gives the rate of substitution between
(x1,  x2) and (x1 + Δx1, x2 + Δx2). For very small changes, the slope of the line
joining the two points (x1, x2) and (x1 + Δx1, x2 + Δx2) reduces to the slope of the
indifference curve at (x1, x2). Thus, for very small changes, the absolute value
of the slope of the indifference curve at any point measures the rate of
substitution of the consumer at that point. Usually, for small changes, the
rate of substitution between good 2 and good 1 is called the marginal rate
of substitution (MRS).
preferences
monotonic, an increase in the
amount of good 1 along the
indifference curve is associated
with a decrease in the amount of
good 2. This implies that the slope
of the indifference curve is negative.
Thus, monotonicity of preferences
implies that the indifference
curves are downward sloping.
Figure 2.7 illustrates the negative
slope of an indifference curve.
Figure 2.8 illustrates an
indifference curve with diminishing
marginal rate of substitution. The
indifference curve is convex towards
the origin.

2.2.6 Indifference Map
The consumer’s preferences over all the bundles can be represented by a family
of indifference curves as shown in Figure 2.9. This is called an indifference map
of the consumer. All points on an indifference curve represent bundles which
are considered indifferent by the consumer. Monotonicity of preferences imply
that between any two indifference curves, the bundles on the one which lies
above are preferred to the bundles on the one which lies below.
2.2.7 Utility
Often it is possible to represent preferences by assigning numbers to bundles in
a way such that the ranking of bundles is preserved. Preserving the ranking
would require assigning the same number to indifferent bundles and higher
numbers to preferred bundles. The numbers thus assigned to the bundles are
called the utilities of the bundles; and the representation of preferences in terms
of the utility numbers is called a utility function or a utility representation.
Thus, a utility function assigns a number to each and every available bundle in
a way such that between any two bundles if one is preferred to the other, the
preferred bundle gets assigned a higher utility number, and if the two bundles
are indifferent, they are assigned the same utility number.
It is important to note that the preferences are basic and utility numbers
merely represent the preferences. The same preferences can have many different
utility representations. Table 2.2 presents two different utility representations
U1 and U2 of the preferences of Example 2.2.

Equality of the Marginal Rate of Substitution and the Ratio of
the Prices
The optimum bundle of the consumer is located at the point where the
budget line is tangent to one of the indifference curves. If the budget line
is tangent to an indifference curve at a point, the absolute value of the
slope of the indifference curve (MRS) and that of the budget line (price
ratio) are same at that point. Recall from our earlier discussion that the
slope of the indifference curve is the rate at which the consumer is willing
to substitute one good for the other. The slope of the budget line is the
rate at which the consumer is able to substitute one good for the other
in the market. At the optimum, the two rates should be the same. To see
why, consider a point where this is not so. Suppose the MRS at such a
point is 2 and suppose the two goods have the same price. At this point,
the consumer is willing to give up 2 units of good 2 if she is given an
extra unit of good 1. But in the market, she can buy an extra unit of
good 1 if she gives up just 1 unit of good 2. Therefore, if she buys an
2.3 OPTIMAL CHOICE OF THE CONSUMER
In the last two sections, we discussed the set of bundles available to the consumer
and also about her preferences over those bundles. Which bundle does she
choose? In economics, it is generally assumed that the consumer is a rational
individual. A rational individual clearly knows what is good or what is bad for
her, and in any given situation, she always tries to achieve the best for herself.
Thus, not only does a consumer have well-defined preferences over the set of
available bundles, she also acts according to her preferences. From the bundles
which are available to her, a rational consumer always chooses the one which
she prefers the most.
EXAMPLE
Consider the consumer in Example 2.2. Among the bundles that are available to
her, (2, 2) is her most preferred bundle. Therefore, as a rational consumer, she
would choose the bundle (2, 2).
In the earlier sections, it was observed that the budget set describes the
bundles that are available to the consumer and her preferences over the available
bundles can usually be represented by an indifference map. Therefore, the
consumer’s problem can also be stated as follows: The rational consumer’s
problem is to move to a point on the highest possible indifference curve given
her budget set.
If such a point exists, where would it be located? The optimum point would
be located on the budget line. A point below the budget line cannot be the
optimum. Compared to a point below the budget line, there is always some
point on the budget line which contains more of at least one of the goods and
no less of the other, and is, therefore, preferred by a consumer whose preferences
are monotonic. Therefore, if the consumer’s preferences are monotonic, for any
point below the budget line, there is some point on the budget line which is
preferred by the consumer. Points above the budget line are not available to
the consumer. Therefore, the optimum (most preferred) bundle of the consumer
would be on the budget line.

Theory of Consumer Behaviour
Where on the budget line will the optimum bundle be located? The point at
which the budget line just touches (is tangent to), one of the indifference curves
would be the optimum.8 To see why this is so, note that any point on the budget
line other than the point at which it touches the indifference curve lies on a
lower indifference curve and hence is inferior. Therefore, such a point cannot be
the consumer’s optimum. The optimum bundle is located on the budget line at
the point where the budget line is tangent to an indifference curve.
Figure 2.10 illustrates the consumer’s optimum. At

is tangent to the black coloured indifference curve. The first thing to note is that
the indifference curve just touching

extra unit of good 1, she can have more of both the goods compared to
the bundle represented by the point, and hence, move to a preferred
bundle. Thus, a point at which the MRS is greater, the price ratio cannot
be the optimum. A similar argument holds for any point at which the
MRS is less than the price ratio.
Problem of Choice
The problem of choice occurs in many different contexts in life. In any choice
problem, there is a feasible set of alternatives. The feasible set consists of the
alternatives which are available to the individual. The individual is assumed
to have well-defined preferences to the set of feasible alternatives. In other
words, the individual is clear in her mind about her likes and dislikes, and
hence, can compare any two alternatives in the feasible set. Based on her
preferences, the individual can rank the alternatives in the order of preferences
starting from the best. The feasible set and the preference relation defined
over the set of alternatives together constitute the basis of choice. Individuals
are generally assumed to be rational. They have well-defined preferences. In
any given situation, a rational individual tries to do the best for herself.
In the text we studied, the choice problem applied to the particular
context of the consumer’s choice. Here, the budget set is the feasible set

optimum bundle.
8 To be more precise, if the situation is as depicted in Figure 2.10 then the optimum would be
located at the point where the budget line is tangent to one of the indifference curves. However,
there are other situations in which the optimum is at a point where the consumer spends her entire
income on one of the goods only.

2.4 DEMAND
In the previous section, we studied the choice problem of the consumer and
derived the consumer’s optimum bundle given the prices of the goods, the
consumer’s income and her preferences. It was observed that the amount of a
good that the consumer chooses optimally, depends on the price of the good
itself, the prices of other goods, the consumer’s income and her tastes and
preferences. Whenever one or more of these variables change, the quantity of the
good chosen by the consumer is likely to change as well. Here we shall change
one of these variables at a time and study how the amount of the good chosen
by the consumer is related to that variable.
Functions
Consider any two variables x and y. A function
y = f (x)
is a relation between the two variables x and y such that for each value of x,
there is an unique value of the variable y. In other words, f (x) is a rule
which assigns an unique value y for each value of x. As the value of y
depends on the value of x, y is called the dependent variable and x is called
the independent variable.
EXAMPLE
Consider, for example, a situation where x can take the values 0, 1, 2, 3 and
suppose corresponding values of y are 10, 15, 18 and 20, respectively.
Here y and x are related by the function y = f (x) which is defined as follows:
f (0) = 10; f (1) = 15; f (2) = 18 and f (3) = 20.
EXAMPLE
Consider another situation where x can take the values 0, 5, 10 and 20.
And suppose corresponding values of y are 100, 90, 70 and 40, respectively.
Here, y and x are related by the function y = f (x) which is defined as follows:
f (0) = 100; f (10) = 90; f (15) = 70 and f (20) = 40.
Very often a functional relation between the two variables can be
expressed in algebraic form like
y = 5 + x and y = 50 – x
A function y = f (x) is an increasing function if the value of y does not
decrease with increase in the value of x. It is a decreasing function if the
value of y does not increase with increase in the value of x. The function in
Example 1 is an increasing function. So is the function y = x + 5. The function
in Example 2 is a decreasing function. The function y = 50 – x is also
decreasing.
and the different bundles of the two goods which the consumer can buy at
the prevailing market prices are the alternatives. The consumer is assumed
to be rational. Her preference relation to the budget set is well-defined and
she chooses her most preferred bundle from the budget set. The consumer’s
optimum bundle is the choice she makes in the given situation.

Graphical Representation of a Function
A graph of a function y = f (x) is a diagrammatic representation of
the function. Following are the graphs of the functions in the examples
given above.
Usually, in a graph, the independent variable is measured along the
horizontal axis and the dependent variable is measured along the vertical
axis. However, in economics, often the opposite is done. The demand curve,
for example, is drawn by taking the independent variable (price) along the
vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity) along the horizontal axis.
The graph of an increasing function is upward sloping or and the graph of
a decreasing function is downward sloping. As we can see from the diagrams
above, the graph of y = 5 + x is upward sloping and that of y = 50 – x, is
downward sloping.
2.4.1 Demand Curve and the Law of Demand
If the prices of other goods, the consumer’s income and her tastes and preferences
remain unchanged, the amount of a good that the consumer optimally chooses,
becomes entirely dependent on its price. The relation between the consumer’s
optimal choice of the quantity of a good and its price is very important and this
relation is called the demand function. Thus, the consumer’s demand function
for a good gives the amount of the good that the consumer chooses at different
levels of its price when the other things remain unchanged. The consumer’s
demand for a good as a function of its price can be written as
q = d(p)
(2.12)
where q denotes the quantity and p denotes the price of the good.

9Consider, for example, a consumer whose income is Rs 30. Suppose the price of good 1 is Rs 4
and that of good 2 is Rs 5, and at these prices, the consumer’s optimum bundle is (5,2). Now
suppose price of good 1 falls to Rs 3. After the fall in price, if the consumer’s income is reduced by
Rs 5, she can just buy the bundle (5, 2). Note that the change in the price of good 1 (Rs 1) times,
the amount of good 1 that she was buying prior to the price change (5 units) is equal to the
adjustment required in her income (Rs 5).
Demand Curve. The demand curve is a
relation between the quantity of the good
chosen by a consumer and the price of the
good. The independent variable (price) is
measured along the vertical axis and
dependent variable (quantity) is measured
along the horizontal axis. The demand curve
gives the quantity demanded by the
consumer at each price.
The demand function can also be
represented graphically as in Figure
2.11. The graphical representation of
the demand function is called the
demand curve.
relation
between
consumer’s demand for a good and the
price of the good is likely to be negative
in general. In other words, the amount
of a good that a consumer would
optimally choose is likely to increase
when the price of the good falls and it
is likely to decrease with a rise in the
price of the good.
To see why this is the case,
consider a consumer whose income is
M and let the prices of the two goods
be p1 and p2. Suppose, in this situation,
the optimum bundle of the consumer
. Now, consider a fall in the
price of good 1 by the amount Δp1. The new price of good 1 is (p1 – Δp1). Note that
the price change has two effects
(i) Good 1 becomes relatively cheaper than good 2 as compared to what it was
before.
(ii) The purchasing power of the consumer increases. The price change, in general,
allows the consumer to buy more goods with the same amount of money as
before. In particular, she can buy the bundle which she was buying before
by spending less than M.
Both these effects of the price change, the change in the purchasing power
and the change in the relative price, are likely to influence the consumer’s optimal
choice. In order to find out how the consumer would react to the change in the
relative price, let us suppose that her purchasing power is adjusted in a way
such that she can just afford to buy the bundle
At the prices (p1– Δp1) and p2, the bundle
costs (p1– Δp1)
p x .
Therefore, if the consumer’s income is reduced by the amount Δ
p x  after
the fall in the price of good 1, her purchasing power is adjusted to the initial
level.9 Suppose, at prices (p1 – Δp1), p2 and income (
), the consumer’s
optimum bundle is
must be greater than or equal to
x . To see
why, consider the Figure 2.12.

on or below the budget line are available to the consumer. As the consumer’s
preferences are monotonic, the optimum bundle
lies on the budget
line. The blue line represents the budget line after the fall in the price of Good 1.
If the consumer’s income is reduced by an amount Δ
p x , there would be a
parallel leftward shift of blue budget line. Note that the shifted budget line
passes through
. This is because the income is adjusted in a way
such that the consumer has just enough money to buy the bundle
If the consumer’s income is thus adjusted after the price change, which
bundle is she going to choose? Certainly, the optimum bundle would lie on
the shifted budget line. But can she choose any bundle to the left of the point
? Certainly not. Note that all points on this budget line which are to
the left of
lie below the grey budget line, and therefore, were available
prior to the price change. Compared to any of these points, there is at least
one point on the grey budget line which is preferred by the consumer. Also
note that since
was the optimum bundle prior to the price change,
the consumer must consider
to be at least as good as any other bundle
on the grey budget line. Therefore, it follows that all points on the shifted
budget line which are to the left of
must be inferior to
. It does
not make sense for the rational consumer to choose an inferior bundle when the
bundle
is still available. Bundles on the shifted budget line which are
to the right of the point
were not available before the price change. If
any of these bundles is preferred to
by the consumer, she can choose
such a bundle, or else, she will continue to choose the bundle
. Note
that all those bundles on the shifted budget line which are to the right of
contain more than
x  units of good 1. Thus, if price of good 1 falls and the
income of the consumer is adjusted to the previous level of her purchasing power,
the rational consumer will not reduce her consumption of good 1. The change
in the optimal quantity of a good when its price changes and the consumer’s
income is adjusted so that she can just buy the bundle that she was buying
before the price change is called the substitution effect.
Substitution Effect. The grey line represents the consumer’s budget line prior to the price
change. The blue line in panel (a) represents the consumer’s budget line after the fall in price
of Good 1. The blue line in panel (b) represents the budget line when the consumer’s income

10 As we shall shortly discuss, a rise in the purchasing power (income) of the consumer can
sometimes induce the consumer to reduce the consumption of a good. In such a case, the substitution
effect and the income effect will work in opposite directions. The demand for such a good can be
inversely or positively related to its price depending on the relative strengths of these two opposing
effects. If the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect, the demand for the good and
the price of the good would still be inversely related. However, if the income effect is stronger than
the substitution effect, the demand for the good would be positively related to its price. Such a good
is called a Giffen good.
Linear Demand Curve. The diagram depicts
the linear demand curve given by equation 2.13.
However, if the income of the consumer does not change, then due to the fall
in the price of good 1 the consumer would experience a rise in the purchasing
power as well. In general, a rise in the purchasing power of the consumer induces
the consumer to consume more of a good. The change in the optimal quantity of
a good when the purchasing power changes consequent upon a change in the
price of the good is called the income effect. Thus, the two effects of a fall in the
price of good 1 work together and there is a rise in the consumer’s demand for
good 1.10 Thus, given the price of  other goods, the consumer’s income and her
tastes and preferences, the amount of a good that the consumer optimally
chooses, is inversely related to the price of the good. Hence, the demand curve
for a good is, in general, downward sloping as represented in Figure 2.11. The
inverse relationship between the consumer’s demand for a good and the price of
the good is often called the Law of Demand.
Law of Demand: If a consumer’s demand for a good moves in the same
direction as the consumer’s income, the consumer’s demand for that good
must be inversely related to the price of the good.
Linear Demand
A linear demand curve can be written as
d(p) = a – bp; 0 ≤ p ≤ a
= 0; p > a
(2.13)
where a is the vertical intercept, –b
is the slope of the demand curve. At
price 0, the demand is a, and at price
equal to a
b , the demand is 0. The
slope of the demand curve measures
the rate at which demand changes
with respect to its price. For a unit
increase in the price of the good, the
demand falls by b units. Figure 2.13
depicts a linear demand curve.
2.4.2 Normal and Inferior Goods
The demand function is a relation
between the consumer’s demand for a good and its price when other things
are given. Instead of studying the relation between the demand for a good
and its price, we can also study the relation between the consumer’s demand
for the good and the income of the consumer. The quantity of a good that the
consumer demands can increase or decrease with the rise in income depending
on the nature of the good. For most goods, the quantity that a consumer
chooses, increases as the consumer’s income increases and decreases as the

Theory of Consumer Behaviour
consumer’s income decreases. Such goods are called normal goods. Thus,
a consumer’s demand for a normal good moves in the same direction as the
income of the consumer. However, there are some goods the demands for
which move in the opposite direction of the income of the consumer. Such
goods are called inferior goods. As the income of the consumer increases,
the demand for an inferior good falls, and as the income decreases, the demand
for an inferior good rises. Examples of inferior goods include low quality food
items like coarse cereals.
A good can be a normal good for the consumer at some levels of income and
an inferior good for her at other levels of income. At very low levels of income, a
consumer’s demand for low quality cereals can increase with income. But, beyond
a level, any increase in income of the consumer is likely to reduce her
consumption of such food items.
2.4.3 Substitutes and Complements
We can also study the relation between the quantity of a good that a consumer
chooses and the price of a related good. The quantity of a good that the
consumer chooses can increase or decrease with the rise in the price of a
related good depending on whether the two goods are substitutes or
complementary to each other. Goods which are consumed together are called
complementary goods. Examples of goods which are complement to each
other include tea and sugar, shoes and socks, pen and ink, etc. Since tea
and sugar are used together, an increase in the price of sugar is likely to
decrease the demand for tea and a decrease in the price of sugar is likely to
increase the demand for tea. Similar is the case with other complements. In
general, the demand for a good moves in the opposite direction of the price of
its complementary goods.
In contrast to complements, goods like tea and coffee are not consumed
together. In fact, they are substitutes for each other. Since tea is a substitute for
coffee, if the price of coffee increases, the consumers can shift to tea, and hence,
the consumption of tea is likely to go up. On the other hand, if the price of coffee
decreases, the consumption of tea is likely to go down. The demand for a good
usually moves in the direction of the price of its substitutes.
2.4.4 Shifts in the Demand Curve
The demand curve was drawn under the assumption that the consumer’s
income, the prices of other goods and the preferences of the consumer are given.
What happens to the demand curve when any of these things changes?
Given the prices of other goods and the preferences of a consumer, if the
income increases, the demand for the good at each price changes, and hence,
there is a shift in the demand curve. For normal goods, the demand curve shifts
rightward and for inferior goods, the demand curve shifts leftward.
Given the consumer’s income and her preferences, if the price of a related
good changes, the demand for a good at each level of its price changes, and
hence, there is a shift in the demand curve. If there is an increase in the price of
a substitute good, the demand curve shifts rightward. On the other hand, if
there is an increase in the price of a complementary good, the demand curve
shifts leftward.
The demand curve can also shift due to a change in the tastes and preferences
of the consumer. If the consumer’s preferences change in favour of a good, the
demand curve for such a good shifts rightward. On the other hand, the demand

curve shifts leftward due to an unfavourable change in the preferences of the
consumer. The demand curve for ice-creams, for example, is likely to shift
rightward in the summer because of preference for ice-creams goes up in
summer. Revelation of the fact that cold-drinks might be injurious to health can
lead to a change in preferences to cold-drinks. This is likely to result in a leftward
shift in the demand curve for cold-drinks.
Shifts in the demand curve are depicted in Figure 2.14.
Shifts in Demand. The demand curve in panel (a) shifts leftward and that in panel
(b) shifts rightward.
2.4.5 Movements along the Demand Curve and Shifts in the
Demand Curve
As it has been noted earlier, the amount of a good that the consumer chooses
depends on the price of the good, the prices of other goods, income of the
consumer and her tastes and preferences. The demand function is a relation
between the amount of the good and its price when other things remain
unchanged. The demand curve is a graphical representation of the demand
function. At higher prices, the demand is less, and at lower prices, the demand
is more. Thus, any change in the price leads to movements along the demand
curve. On the other hand, changes in any of the other things lead to a shift in
the demand curve. Figure 2.15 illustrates a movement along the demand
curve and a shift in the demand curve.

2.5 MARKET DEMAND
In the last section, we studied the choice problem of the individual consumer
and derived the demand curve of the consumer. However, in the market for a
good, there are many consumers. It is important to find out the market demand
for the good. The market demand for a good at a particular price is the total
demand of all consumers taken together. The market demand for a good can be
derived from the individual demand curves. Suppose there are only two
consumers in the market for a good. Suppose at price p′, the demand of consumer
1 is q′1 and that of consumer 2 is q′2. Then, the market demand of the good at p′
is q′1 + q′2. Similarly, at price ˆp , if the demand of consumer 1 is
1ˆq  and that of
consumer 2 is
ˆq , the market demand of the good at ˆp  is
. Thus, the
market demand for the good at each price can be derived by adding up the
demands of the two consumers at that price. If there are more than two consumers
in the market for a good, the market demand can be derived similarly.
The market demand curve of a good can also be derived from the individual
demand curves graphically by adding up the individual demand curves
horizontally as shown in Figure 2.16. This method of adding two curves is called
horizontal summation.
Derivation of the Market Demand Curve. The market demand curve can be derived as
a horizontal summation of the individual demand curves.
Adding up Two Linear Demand Curves
Consider, for example, a market where there are two consumers and the demand
curves of the two consumers are given as
d1(p) = 10 – p
(2.14)
and d2(p) = 15 – p
(2.15)
Furthermore, at any price greater than 10, the consumer 1 demands 0 unit of
the good, and similarly, at any price greater than 15, the consumer 2 demands 0
unit of the good. The market demand can be derived by adding equations (2.12)
and (2.13). At any price less than or equal to 10, the market demand is given by
25 – 2p, for any price greater than 10, and less than or equal to 15, market
demand is 15 – p, and at any price greater than 15, the market demand is 0.
2.6 ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
The demand for a good moves in the opposite direction of its price. But the
impact of the price change is always not the same. Sometimes, the demand for a

good changes considerably even for small price changes. On the other hand,
there are some goods for which the demand is not affected much by price changes.
Demands for some goods are very responsive to price changes while demands
for certain others are not so responsive to price changes. Price-elasticity of demand
is a measure of the responsiveness of the demand for a good to changes in its
price. Price-elasticity of demand for a good is defined as the percentage change
in demand for the good divided by the percentage change in its price. Price-
elasticity of demand for a good
percentage change in demand for the good
percentage change in the price of the good
Consider the demand curve of a good. Suppose at price p0, the demand for
the good is q0 and at price p1, the demand for the good is q1. If price changes
from p0 to p1, the change in the price of the good is, Δp = p1 – p0, and the change
in the quantity of the good is, Δq = q1 – q0. The percentage change in price is,
× 100 =
× 100, and the percentage change in quantity,
) 100
(2.16)
It is important to note that elasticity of demand is a number and it does not
depend on the units in which the price of the good and the quantity of the good
are measured.
Also note that the price elasticity of demand is a negative number since the
demand for a good is negatively related to the price of a good. However, for
simplicity, we will always refer to the absolute value of the elasticity.
The more responsive the demand for a good is to its price, the higher is the
price- elasticity of demand for the good. If at some price, the percentage change
in demand for a good is less than the percentage change in the price, then
|eD|< 1 and demand for the good is said to be inelastic at that price. If at some
price, the percentage change in demand for a good is equal to the percentage
change in the price, |eD|= 1, and demand for the good is said to be unitary-
elastic at that price. If at some price, the percentage change in demand for a
good is greater than the percentage change in the price, then |eD|> 1, and
demand for the good is said to be elastic at that price.
Price elasticity of demand is a pure number and does not depend on
the units in which price and quantity are measured
Suppose the unit of money is rupee and the quantity is measured in
kilograms. At price p0, let the demand be q0, and at price p1, let the demand
be q1. Consider a price change from p0 to p1.
The change in price = p1 rupees per kilogram – p0 rupees per kilogram
= (p1 – p0) rupees per kilogram.

Introductory Microeconomics
From (2.17), it is clear that the
elasticity of demand is different at
different points on a linear demand
curve. At p = 0, the elasticity is 0, at
q = 0, elasticity is ∞. At p = 2
b , the
elasticity is 1, at any price greater than
0 and less than 2
b , elasticity is less
than 1, and at any price greater than
b , elasticity is greater than 1. The
price elasticities of demand along the
linear demand curve given by equation
(2.17) are depicted in Figure 2.17.
Constant Elasticity Demand Curves
The elasticity of demand on different points on a linear demand curve is different
varying from 0 to ∞. But sometimes, the demand curves can be such that the
elasticity of demand remains constant throughout. Consider, for example, a
vertical demand curve as the one depicted in Figure 2.18 (a). Whatever be the
price, the demand is given at the level q . A price change never leads to a change
in the demand for such a demand curve and |eD| is always 0. Therefore, a
vertical demand curve is perfectly inelastic.
Geometric Measure of Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve
The elasticity of a linear
demand curve can easily be
measured geometrically. The
elasticity of demand at any
point on a straight line demand
curve is given by the ratio of the
lower segment and the upper
segment of the demand curve
at that point. To see why this is
the case, consider the following
figure which depicts a straight
line demand curve, q = a – bp.
Suppose at price p0, the
demand for the good is q0. Now consider a small change in the price. The
new price is p1, and at that price, demand for the good is q1.
Δq = q1q0 = CD and Δp = p1p0 = CE.
Therefore, eD =
CE  ×
Since ECD and Bp0D are similar triangles, CD
CE  =
p B . But
p B  =

Curve. Price elasticity of demand is different
at different points on the linear demand
curve.

Since Bp0D and BOA are similar triangles,
p B  = DA
Thus, eD = DA
The elasticity of demand at different points on a straight line demand
curve can be derived by this method. Elasticity is 0 at the point where the
demand curve meets the horizontal axis and it is ∝ at the point where the
demand curve meets the vertical axis. At the midpoint of the demand curve,
the elasticity is 1, at any point to the left of the midpoint, it is greater than 1
and at any point to the right, it is less than 1.
Note that along the horizontal axis p = 0, along the vertical axis q = 0
and at the midpoint of the demand curve p = 2
Figure 2.18(b) depicts a demand curve which has the shape of a rectangular
hyperbola. This demand curve has the nice property that a percentage change
in price along the demand curve always leads to equal percentage change in
quantity. Therefore, |eD| = 1 at every point on this demand curve. This demand
curve is called the unitary elastic demand curve.
2.6.2 Factors Determining Price Elasticity of Demand for a Good
The price elasticity of demand for a good depends on the nature of the good and
the availability of close substitutes of the good. Consider, for example, necessities
like food. Such goods are essential for life and the demands for such goods do
not change much in response to changes in their prices. Demand for food does
not change much even if food prices go up. On the other hand, demand for
luxuries can be very responsive to price changes. In general, demand for a
necessity is likely to be price inelastic while demand for a luxury good is likely
to be price elastic.
Though demand for food is inelastic, the demands for specific food items are
likely to be more elastic. For example, think of a particular variety of pulses. If the
price of this variety of pulses goes up, people can shift to some other variety of
pulses which is a close substitute. The demand for a good is likely to be elastic if
Constant Elasticity Demand Curves. Elasticity of demand at all points along the vertical
demand curve, as shown in panel (a), is 0. Elasticity at all points on the demand curve in
panel (b) is 1.

Introductory Microeconomics
close substitutes are easily available. On the other hand, if close substitutes are
not available easily, the demand for a good is likely to be inelastic.
2.6.3 Elasticity and Expenditure
The expenditure on a good is equal to the demand for the good times its price.
Often it is important to know how the expenditure on a good changes as a result
of a price change. The price of a good and the demand for the good are inversely
related to each other. Whether the expenditure on the good goes up or down as
a result of an increase in its price depends on how responsive the demand for
the good is to the price change.
Consider an increase in the price of a good. If the percentage decline in
quantity is greater than the percentage increase in the price, the expenditure on
the good will go down. On the other hand, if the percentage decline in quantity
is less than the percentage increase in the price, the expenditure on the good
will go up. And if the percentage decline in quantity is equal to the percentage
increase in the price, the expenditure on the good will remain unchanged.
Relationship between Elasticity and change in Expenditure on a Good
Suppose at price p, the demand for a good is q, and at price p + Δp, the
demand for the good is q + Δq.
At price p, the total expenditure on the good is pq, and at price p + Δp,
the total expenditure on the good is (p + Δp)(q + Δq).
If price changes from p to (p + Δp), the change in the expenditure on the
good is, (p + Δp)(q + Δq) – pq = qΔp + pΔq + ΔpΔq.
For small values of Δp and Δq, the value of the term ΔpΔq is negligible,
and in that case, the change in the expenditure on the good is approximately
given by qΔp + pΔq.
Approximate change in expenditure = ΔE = qΔp + pΔq = Δp(q + p q
= Δp[q(1 +
)] = Δp[q(1 + eD)].
Note that
if eD < –1, then q (1 + eD) < 0, and hence, ΔE has the opposite sign as Δp,
if eD > –1, then q (1 + eD) > 0, and hence, ΔE has the same sign as Δp,
if eD = –1, then q (1 + eD) = 0, and hence, ΔE = 0.
Now consider a decline in the price of the good. If the percentage increase in
quantity is greater than the percentage decline in the price, the expenditure on
the good will go up. On the other hand, if the percentage increase in quantity is
less than the percentage decline in the price, the expenditure on the good will go
down. And if the percentage increase in quantity is equal to the percentage decline
in the price, the expenditure on the good will remain unchanged.
The expenditure on the good would change in the opposite direction as the
price change if and only if the percentage change in quantity is greater than the
percentage change in price, ie if the good is price-elastic. The expenditure on the
good would change in the same direction as the price change if and only if the
percentage change in quantity is less than the percentage change in price, i.e., if
the good is price inelastic. The expenditure on the good would remain unchanged

Rectangular Hyperbola
An equation of the form
xy = c
where x and y are two variables and c
is a constant, giving us a curve called
rectangular hyperbola. It is a
downward sloping curve in the x-y
plane as shown in the diagram. For
any two points p and q on the curve,
the areas of the two rectangles Oy1px1
and Oy2qx2 are same and equal to c.
If the equation of a demand curve
takes the form pq = e, where e is a constant, it will be a rectangular
hyperbola, where price (p) times quantity (q) is a constant. With such a
demand curve, no matter at what point the consumer consumes, her
expenditures are always the same and equal to e.
if and only if the percentage change in quantity is equal to the percentage change
in price, i.e., if the good is unit-elastic.
The budget set is the collection of all bundles of goods that a consumer can buy
with her income at the prevailing market prices.
The budget line represents all bundles which cost the consumer her entire income.
The budget line is negatively sloping.
The budget set changes if either of the two prices or the income changes.
The consumer has well-defined preferences over the collection of all possible
bundles. She can rank the available bundles according to her preferences
over them.
The consumer’s preferences are assumed to be monotonic.
An indifference curve is a locus of all points representing bundles among which
the consumer is indifferent.
Monotonicity of preferences implies that the indifference curve is downward
sloping.
A consumer’s preferences, in general, can be represented by an indifference map.
A consumer’s preferences, in general, can also be represented by a utility function.
A rational consumer always chooses her most preferred bundle from the budget set.
The consumer’s optimum bundle is located at the point of tangency between the
budget line and an indifference curve.
The consumer’s demand curve gives the amount of the good that a consumer
chooses at different levels of its price when the price of other goods, the consumer’s
income and her tastes and preferences remain unchanged.
The demand curve is generally downward sloping.
The demand for a normal good increases (decreases) with increase (decrease) in
the consumer’s income.
The demand for an inferior good decreases (increases) as the income of the
consumer increases (decreases).

A Firm Effort
In the previous chapter, we have discussed the behaviour of the
consumers. In this chapter as well as in the next, we shall examine
the behaviour of a producer. A producer or a firm acquires different
inputs like labour, machines, land, raw materials, etc. Combining
these inputs, it produces output. This is called the process of
production. In order to acquire inputs, it has to pay for them.
That is the cost of production. Once the output has been produced,
the firm sells it in the market and earns revenue. The revenue that
it earns net of cost is the profit of the firm. We assume here that the
objective of a firm is to maximise its profit. A firm looking at its
cost structure and the market price of output decides to produce
an amount of output such that its profit reaches the maximum.
In this chapter, we study different aspects of the production
function of a firm. We discuss here – the relationship between
inputs and output, the contribution of a variable input in the
production process and different properties of production function.
Then we look at the cost structure of the firm. We discuss the cost
function and its various aspects. We learn about the properties of
the short run and the long run cost curves.
3.1  PRODUCTION FUNCTION
The production function of a firm is a relationship between
inputs used and output produced by the firm. For
various quantities of inputs used, it gives the
maximum quantity of output that can be produced.
Consider a manufacturer who produces shoes.
She employs two workers – worker 1 and worker
2, two machines – machine 1 and machine 2, and
10 kilograms of raw materials. Worker 1 is good
in operating machine 1 and worker 2 is good in
operating machine 2. If worker 1 uses machine
1 and worker 2 uses machine 2, then with 10
kilograms of raw materials, they can produce 10
pairs of shoes. However, if worker 1 uses machine
2 and worker 2 uses machine 1, which they are not
good at operating, with the same 10 kilograms of raw
materials, they will end up producing only 8 pairs of
shoes. So with efficient use of inputs, 10 pairs of shoes can
be produced whereas an inefficient use results in production

of 8 pairs of shoes. Production function considers only the efficient use of inputs.
It says  that worker 1, worker 2, machine 1, machine 2 and 10 kilograms of raw
materials together can produce 10 pairs of shoes which is the maximum possible
output for this input combination.
A production function is defined for a given technology. It is the technological
knowledge that determines the maximum levels of output that can be produced
using different combinations of inputs. If the technology improves, the maximum
levels of output obtainable for different input combinations increase. We then
have a new production function.
The inputs that a firm uses in the production process are called factors of
production. In order to produce output, a firm may require any number of
different inputs. However, for the time being, here we consider a firm that produces
output using only two factors of production – factor 1 and factor 2. Our
production function, therefore, tells us what maximum quantity of output can
be produced by using different combinations of these two factors.
We may write the production function as
q = f (x1, x2)
(3.1)
It says that by using x1 amount of factor 1 and x2 amount of factor 2, we can
at most produce q amount of the commodity.
Table 3.1: Production Function
Factor
A numerical example of production function is given in Table 3.1. The left
column shows the amount of factor 1 and the top row shows the amount of
factor 2. As we move to the right along any row, factor 2 increases and as we
move down along any column, factor 1 increases. For different values of the two
factors, the table shows the corresponding output levels. For example, with 1
unit of factor 1 and 1 unit of factor 2, the firm can produce at most 1 unit of
output; with 2 units of factor 1 and 2 units of factor 2, it can produce at most 10
units of output; with 3 units of factor 1 and 2 units of factor 2, it can produce at
most 18 units of output and so on.
Isoquant
In Chapter 2, we have learnt about indifference curves. Here, we introduce a
similar concept known as isoquant. It is just an alternative way of
representing the production function. Consider a production function with
two inputs factor 1 and factor 2. An isoquant is the set of all possible
combinations of the two inputs that yield the same maximum possible level
of output. Each isoquant represents a particular level of output and is
labelled with that amount of output.
Production and Costs

Introductory Microeconomics
In our example, both the inputs are necessary for the production. If any of
the inputs becomes zero, there will be no production. With both inputs positive,
output will be positive. As we increase the amount of any input, output increases.
3.2 THE SHORT RUN AND THE LONG RUN
Before we begin with any further analysis, it is important to discuss two concepts–
the short run and the long run.
In the short run, a firm cannot vary all the inputs. One of the factors – factor 1
or factor 2 – cannot be varied, and therefore, remain fixed in the short run. In
order to vary the output level, the firm can vary only the other factor. The factor
that remains fixed is called the fixed input whereas the other factor which the
firm can vary is called the variable input.
Consider the example represented through Table 3.1. Suppose, in the short
run, factor 2 remains fixed at 5 units. Then the corresponding column shows
the different levels of output that the firm may produce using different quantities
of factor 1 in the short run.
In the long run, all factors of production can be varied. A firm in order to
produce different levels of output in the long run may vary both the inputs
simultaneously. So, in the long run, there is no fixed input.
For any particular production process, long run generally refers to a longer
time period than the short run. For different production processes, the long run
periods may be different. It is not advisable to define short run and long run in
terms of say, days, months or years. We define a period as long run or short run
simply by looking at whether all the inputs can be varied or not.
3.3 TOTAL PRODUCT, AVERAGE PRODUCT AND MARGINAL PRODUCT
3.3.1 Total Product
Suppose we vary a single input and keep all other inputs constant. Then
for different levels of employment of that input, we get different levels of
output from the production function. This relationship between the variable
input and output, keeping all other inputs constant, is often referred to as
Total Product (TP) of the variable input.
In the diagram, we have
three isoquants for the three
output levels, namely q = q1,
q = q2 and q = q3 in the
inputs plane. Two input
combinations (x′1, x′′2) and
1, x′2) give us the same level
of output q1. If we fix factor 2
at x′2 and increase factor 1 to
1 , output increases and we
reach a higher isoquant,
q = q2. When marginal
products are positive, with
greater amount of one input,
the same level of output can be produced by using lesser amount of the
other. Therefore, isoquants are negatively sloped.
Factor 2
Factor 1

Production and Costs
In our production function, if we keep factor 2 constant, say, at the value
and vary factor 1, then for each value of x1, we get a value of q for that particular
x . We write it in the following way
q = f (x1;
(3.2)
This is the total product function of factor 1.
Let us again look at Table 3.1. Suppose factor 2 is fixed at 4 units. Now in
the Table 3.1, we look at the column where factor 2 takes the value 4. As we
move down along the column, we get the output values for different values of
factor 1. This is the total product of factor 1 schedule with x2 = 4. At x1 = 0, the
TP is 0, at x1 = 1, TP is 10 units of output, at x1 = 2, TP is 24 units of output
and so on. This is also sometimes called total return to or total physical
product of the variable input.
Once we have defined total product, it will be useful to define the concepts of
average product (AP) and marginal product (MP). They are useful in order to
describe the contribution of the variable input to the production process.
3.3.2 Average Product
Average product is defined as the output per unit of variable input. We calculate
it as

Table 3.2 gives us a numerical example of average product of factor 1. In
Table 3.1, we have already seen the total product of factor 1 for x2 = 4. In Table
3.2 we reproduce the total product schedule and extend the table to show the
corresponding values of average product and marginal product. The first column
shows the amount of factor 1 and in the fourth column we get the corresponding
average product value. It shows that at 1 unit of factor 1, AP1 is 10 units of
output, at 2 units of factor 1, AP1 is 12 units of output and so on.
3.3.3 Marginal Product
Marginal product of an input is defined as the change in output per unit of
change in the input when all other inputs are held constant. When factor 2 is held
constant,  the marginal product of factor 1 is
MP1 =
change in output
change in input
(3.4)
where Δ represents the change of the variable.
If the input changes by discrete units, the marginal product can be defined
in the following way. Suppose, factor 2 is fixed at
x . With
x  amount of factor
2, let, according to the total product curve, x1 units of factor 1 produce 20 units
of the output and x1 – 1 units of factor 1 produce 15 units of the output. We say
that the marginal product of the x1th unit of factor 1 is
MP1 = f(x1;
x ) – f(x1 – 1;
(3.5)
= (TP at x1 units) – (TP at x1 – 1 unit)
=  (20 – 15) units of output
= 5 units of output

3.4 THE LAW OF DIMINISHING MARGINAL PRODUCT AND
THE LAW OF VARIABLE PROPORTIONS
The law of diminishing marginal product says that if we keep increasing the
employment of an input, with other inputs fixed, eventually a point will be reached
after which the resulting addition to output (i.e., marginal product of that input)
will start falling.
A somewhat related concept with the law of diminishing marginal product
is the law of variable proportions. It says that the marginal product of a
factor input initially rises with its employment level. But after reaching a certain
level of employment, it starts falling.
The reason behind the law of diminishing returns or the law of variable
proportion is the following. As we hold one factor input fixed and keep increasing
the other, the factor proportions change. Initially, as we increase the amount of
the variable input, the factor proportions become more and more suitable for
the production and marginal product increases. But after a certain level of
employment, the production process becomes too crowded with the variable
input and the factor proportions become less and less suitable for the production.
It is from this point that the marginal product of the variable input starts falling.
Let us look at Table 3.2 again. With factor 2 fixed at 4 units, the table shows
us the TP, MP1 and AP1 for different values of factor 1. We see that up to the
employment level of 3 units of factor 1, its marginal product increases. Then it
starts falling.
Table 3.2: Total Product, Marginal product and Average product
Factor 1
13.33
Since inputs cannot take negative values, marginal product is undefined at
zero level of input employment. Marginal products are additions to total product.
For any level of employment of an input, the sum of marginal products of every
unit of that input up to that level gives the total product of that input at that
employment level. So total product is the sum of marginal products.
Average product of an input at any level of employment is the average of all
marginal products up to that level. Average and marginal products are often
referred to as average and marginal returns, respectively, to the variable input.
In the example represented through Table 3.1, if we keep factor 2 constant
say, at 4 units, we get a total product schedule. From the total product, we then
derive the marginal product and average product of factor 1. The third column
of Table 3.2 shows that at zero unit of factor 1, MP1 is undefined. At
x1 = 1, Mp1 is 10 units of output, at x1 = 2, MP1 is 14 units of output and so on.

Total Product. This is a total product curve for
factor 1. When all other inputs are held constant,
it shows the different output levels obtainable from
different amounts of factor 1.
3.5 SHAPES OF TOTAL PRODUCT, MARGINAL PRODUCT
AND AVERAGE PRODUCT CURVES
An increase in the amount of one of the inputs keeping all other inputs constant
generally results in an increase in output. Table 3.2 shows how the total product
changes as the amount of factor 1 increases. The total product curve in the
input-output plane is a positively sloped curve. Figure 3.1 shows the shape of
the total product curve for a typical firm.
We measure units of factor 1 along the horizontal axis and output along
the vertical axis. With x1 units of factor 1, the firm can at most produce q1
units of output.
According to the law of variable proportions, the marginal product of an
input initially rises and then after a certain level of employment, it starts falling.
The MP curve in the input-output plane, therefore, looks like an inverse
‘U’-shaped curve.
Let us now see what the AP
curve looks like. For the first unit
of the variable input, one can
easily check that the MP and the
AP are same. Now as we increase
the amount of input, the MP rises.
AP being the average of marginal
products, also rises, but rises less
than MP. Then, after a point, the
MP starts falling. However, as long
as the value of MP remains higher
than the value of the prevailing
AP, the latter continues to rise.
Once MP has fallen sufficiently, its
value becomes less than the
prevailing AP and the latter also
starts falling. So AP curve is also
inverse ‘U’-shaped.
As long as the AP increases, it
must be the case that MP is
greater than AP. Otherwise, AP
cannot rise. Similarly, when AP
falls, MP has to be less than AP.
It, therefore, follows that MP curve
cuts AP curve from above at its
maximum.
Figure 3.2 shows the shapes
of AP and MP curves for a typical
firm.
The AP of factor 1 is maximum
at x1. To the left of x1, AP is rising
and MP is greater than AP. To the
right of x1, AP is falling and MP is
less than AP.

Returns to Scale
Consider a production function
q = f (x1, x2)
where the firm produces q amount of output using x1 amount of factor 1
and x2 amount of factor 2. Now suppose the firm decides to increase the
employment level of both the factors t (t > 1) times. Mathematically, we
can say that the production function exhibits constant returns to scale if
we have,
f (tx1, tx2) = t.f (x1, x2)
ie the new output level f (tx1, tx2) is exactly t times the previous output level
f (x1, x2).
Similarly, the production function exhibits increasing returns to scale if,
f (tx1, tx2) > t.f (x1, x2).
It exhibits decreasing returns to scale if,
f (tx1, tx2) < t.f (x1, x2).
3.6 RETURNS TO SCALE
So far we looked at various aspects of production function when a single
input varied and others remained fixed. Now we shall see what happens when
all inputs vary simultaneously.
Constant returns to scale (CRS) is a property of production function
that holds when a proportional increase in all inputs results in an increase
in output by the same proportion.
Increasing returns to scale (IRS) holds when a proportional increase in
all inputs results in an increase in output by more than the proportion.
Decreasing returns to scale (DRS) holds when a proportional increase
in all inputs results in an increase in output by less than the proportion.
For example, suppose in a production process, all inputs get doubled.
As a result, if the output gets doubled, the production function exhibits CRS.
If output is less than doubled, the DRS holds, and if it is more than doubled,
the IRS holds.
3.7 COSTS
In order to produce output, the firm needs to employ inputs. But a given level
of output, typically, can be produced in many ways. There can be more than
one input combinations with which a firm can produce a desired level of output.
In Table 3.1, we can see that 50 units of output can be produced by three
different input combinations – (x1 = 6, x2 = 3), (x1 = 4, x2 = 4) and (x1 = 3, x2 = 6).
The question is which input combination will the firm choose? With the input
prices given, it will choose that combination of inputs which is least expensive.
So, for every level of output, the firm chooses the least cost input combination.
This output-cost relationship is the cost function of the firm.

Production and Costs
3.7.1 Short Run Costs
We have previously discussed the short run and the long run. In the short
run, some of the factors of production cannot be varied, and therefore,
remain fixed. The cost that a firm incurs to employ these fixed inputs is
called the total fixed cost (TFC). Whatever amount of output the firm
produces, this cost remains fixed for the firm. To produce any required
level of output, the firm, in the short run, can adjust only variable inputs.
Accordingly, the cost that a firm incurs to employ these variable inputs is
called the total variable cost (TVC). Adding the fixed and the variable costs,
we get the total cost (TC) of a firm
TC = TVC + TFC
(3.6)
In order to increase the production of output, the firm needs to employ more
of the variable inputs. As a result, total variable cost and total cost will increase.
Therefore, as output increases, total variable cost and total cost increase.
In Table 3.3, we have an example of cost function of a typical firm. The first
column shows different levels of output. For all levels of output, the total fixed
cost is Rs 20. Total variable cost increases as output increases. With output
zero, TVC is zero. For 1 unit of output, TVC is Rs 10; for 2 units of output, TVC
is Rs 18 and so on. In the fourth column, we obtain the total cost (TC) as the
sum of the corresponding values in second column (TFC) and third column
(TVC). At zero level of output, TC is just the fixed cost, and hence, equal to Rs
20. For 1 unit of output, total cost is Rs 30; for 2 units of output, the TC is Rs 38
and so on.
The short run average cost (SAC) incurred by the firm is defined as the
total cost per unit of output. We calculate it as
SAC = TC
(3.7)
In Table 3.3, we get the SAC-column by dividing the values of the fourth
column by the corresponding values of the first column. At zero output, SAC is
undefined. For the first unit, SAC is Rs 30; for 2 units of output, SAC is Rs 19
and so on.
Cobb-Douglas Production Function
Consider a production function
q = x1
where α and β are constants. The firm produces q amount of output
using x1 amount of factor 1 and x2 amount of factor 2. This is called a
Cobb-Douglas production function. Suppose with x1 =
x  and x2 =
x , we
have q0 units of output, i.e.
If we increase both the inputs t (t > 1) times, we get the new output
q1 = (t
x )α (t
= t α + β
When α + β = 1, we have q1 = tq0. That is, the output increases t times. So the
production function exhibits CRS. Similarly, when α + β > 1, the production
function exhibits IRS. When α + β < 1 the production function exhibits DRS.

Introductory Microeconomics
Similarly, the average variable cost (AVC) is defined as the total variable
cost per unit of output. We calculate it as
AVC = TVC
(3.8)
Also, average fixed cost (AFC) is
AFC = TFC
(3.9)
Clearly,
SAC = AVC + AFC
(3.10)
In Table 3.3, we get the AFC-column by dividing the values of the second
column by the corresponding values of the first column. Similarly, we get the
AVC-column by dividing the values of the third column by the corresponding
values of the first column. At zero level of output, both AFC and AVC are
undefined. For the first unit of output, AFC is Rs 20 and AVC is Rs 10. Adding
them, we get the SAC equal to Rs 30.
The short run marginal cost (SMC) is defined as the change in total cost
per unit of change in output
SMC =
change in total
change in output
(3.11)
where Δ represents the change of the variable.
If output changes in discrete units, we may define the marginal cost in the
following way. Let the cost of production for q1 units and q1 – 1 units of output
be Rs 20 and Rs 15 respectively. Then the marginal cost that the firm incurs for
producing q1th unit of output is
MC = (TC at q1) – (TC at q1 – 1)
(3.12)
= Rs 20 – Rs 15 = Rs 5
Just like the case of marginal product, marginal cost also is undefined at
zero level of output. It is important to note here that in the short run, fixed cost
cannot be changed. When we change the level of output, whatever change occurs
to total cost is entirely due to the change in total variable cost. So in the short

Production and Costs
run, marginal cost is the increase in TVC due to increase in production of one
extra unit of output. For any level of output, the sum of marginal costs up to
that level gives us the total variable cost at that level. One may wish to check this
from the example represented through Table 3.3. Average variable cost at some
level of output is therefore, the average of all marginal costs up to that level. In
Table 3.3, we see that when the output is zero, SMC is undefined. For the first
unit of output, SMC is Rs 10; for the second unit, the SMC is Rs 8 and so on.
Shapes of the Short Run Cost Curves
Now let us see what these short run
cost curves look like in the output-
cost plane.
Previously, we have discussed
that in order to increase the
production of output the firm needs
to employ more of the variable
inputs. This results in an increase
in total variable cost, and hence, an
increase in total cost. Therefore, as
output increases, total variable cost
and total cost increase. Total fixed
cost, however, is independent of the
amount of output produced and
remains constant for all levels of
production.
Figure 3.3 illustrates the shapes
of total fixed cost, total variable cost
and total cost curves for a typical
firm. TFC is a constant which takes
the value c1 and does not change
with the change in output. It is,
therefore, a horizontal straight line
cutting the cost axis at the point c1.
At q1, TVC is c2 and TC is c3.
AFC is the ratio of TFC to q. TFC
is a constant. Therefore, as q
increases, AFC decreases. When
output is very close to zero, AFC is
arbitrarily large, and as output
moves towards infinity, AFC moves
towards zero. AFC curve is, in fact,
a rectangular hyperbola. If we
multiply any value q of output with
its corresponding AFC, we always
get a constant, namely TFC.
Figure 3.4 shows the shape of
average fixed cost curve for a typical
firm. We measure output along the horizontal axis and AFC along the vertical
axis. At q1 level of output, we get the corresponding average fixed cost at F. The
TFC can be calculated as
TFC = AFC × quantity
= OF × Oq1
= the area of the rectangle OFCq1
Costs. These are total fixed cost (TFC), total
variable cost (TVC) and total cost (TC) curves
for a firm. Total cost is the vertical sum of total
fixed cost and total variable cost.
Average Fixed Cost. The average fixed cost
curve is a rectangular hyperbola. The area
of the rectangle OFCq1 gives us the total
fixed cost.

We can also calculate AFC from
TFC curve. In Figure 3.5, the
horizontal straight line cutting
the vertical axis at F is the TFC
curve. At q0 level of output, total
fixed cost is equal to OF. At q0, the
corresponding point on the TFC
curve is A. Let the angle ∠AOq0 be θ.
The AFC at q0 is
AFC =
quantity
Oq  = tanθ
Let us now look at the SMC
curve. Marginal cost is the additional
cost that a firm incurs to produce one extra unit of output. According to the law
of variable proportions, initially, the marginal product of a factor increases as
employment increases, and then after a certain point, it decreases. This means
initially to produce every next unit of output, the requirement of the factor
becomes less and less, and then after a certain point, it becomes greater and
greater. As a result, with the factor price given, initially the SMC falls, and then
after a certain point, it rises. SMC curve is, therefore, ‘U’-shaped.
At zero level of output, SMC is undefined. When output is discrete, the TVC
at a particular level of output is the sum of all marginal costs up to that level.
When output is perfectly divisible, the TVC at a particular level of output is
given by the area under the SMC curve up to that level.
Now, what does the AVC curve look like? For the first unit of output, it is
easy to check that SMC and AVC are the same. So both SMC and AVC curves
start from the same point. Then, as output increases, SMC falls. AVC being the
average of marginal costs, also falls, but falls less than SMC. Then, after a point,
SMC starts rising. AVC, however, continues to fall as long as the value of SMC
remains less than the prevailing value of AVC. Once the SMC has risen sufficiently,
its value becomes greater than the value of AVC. The AVC then starts rising. The
AVC curve is therefore ‘U’-shaped.
As long as AVC is falling, SMC
must be less than the AVC and as
AVC, rises, SMC must be greater
than the AVC. So the SMC curve cuts
the AVC curve from below at the
minimum point of AVC.
In Figure 3.6 we measure output
along the horizontal axis and AVC
along the vertical axis. At q0 level of
output, AVC is equal to OV . The
total variable cost at q0 is
TVC = AVC × quantity
= OV × Oq0
= the area of the
rectangle OV Bq0.
The Average Variable Cost Curve. The area
of the rectangle OVBq0 gives us the total
variable cost at q0.
The Total Fixed Cost Curve. The slope of
the angle ∠AOq0 gives us the average fixed
cost at q0.

Production and Costs
In Figure 3.7, we measure output
along the horizontal axis and TVC
along the vertical axis. At q0 level
of output, OV is the total variable
cost. Let the angle ∠E0q0 be equal
to θ. Then, at q0, the AVC can be
calculated as
AV C = TVC
output
Oq  = tan θ
Let us now look at SAC. SAC is
the sum of AVC and AFC. Initially,
both AVC and AFC decrease as
output increases. Therefore, SAC
initially falls. After a certain level of
output production, AVC starts rising. Now AVC and AFC are moving in opposite
direction. Here, initially the fall in AFC is greater than the rise in AVC and SAC is
still falling. But, after a certain level of production, rise in AVC overrides the fall in
AFC. From this point onwards, SAC is rising. SAC curve is therefore ‘U’-shaped.
It lies above the AVC curve with the vertical difference being equal to the
value of AFC. The minimum point of SAC curve lies to the right of the minimum
point of AVC curve.
Similar to the case of AVC and SMC, here too as long as SAC is falling, SMC
is less than the SAC and when SAC is rising, SMC is greater than the SAC. SMC
curve cuts the SAC curve from below at the minimum point of SAC.
Figure 3.8 shows the shapes of short run marginal cost, average variable cost
and short run average cost curves
for a typical firm. AVC reaches its
minimum at q1 units of output. To
the left of q1, AVC is falling and SMC
is less than AVC. To the right of q1,
AVC is rising and SMC is greater
than AVC. SMC curve cuts the AVC
curve at ‘P ’ which is the minimum
point of AVC curve. The minimum
point of SAC curve is ‘S ’ which
corresponds to the output q2. It is
the intersection point between SMC
and SAC curves. To the left of q2,
SAC is falling and SMC is less than
SAC. To the right of q2, SAC is rising
and SMC is greater than SAC.
3.7.2 Long Run Costs
In the long run, all inputs are variable. The total cost and the total variable cost
therefore, coincide in the long run. Long run average cost (LRAC) is defined as
cost per unit of output, i.e.
LRAC = TC
(3.13)
The Total Variable Cost Curve. The slope
of the angle ∠EOqo gives us the average
variable cost at qo.
Short Run Costs. Short run marginal cost,

Long run marginal cost (LRMC) is the change in total cost per unit of change
in output. When output changes in discrete units, then, if we increase production
from q1–1 to q1 units of output, the marginal cost of producing q1
th unit will be
measured as
LRMC = (TC at q1 units) – (TC at q1 – 1 units)
(3.14)
Just like the short run, in the long run, the sum of all marginal costs up to
some output level gives us the total cost at that level.
Shapes of the Long Run Cost Curves
We have previously discussed the returns to scales. Now let us see their
implications for the shape of LRAC.
IRS implies that if we increase all the inputs by a certain proportion, output
increases by more than that proportion. In other words, to increase output by a
certain proportion, inputs need to be increased by less than that proportion.
With the input prices given, cost also increases by a lesser proportion. For example,
suppose we want to double the output. To do that, inputs need to be increased
by less than double. The cost that the firm incurs to hire those inputs therefore
also need to be increased by less than double. What is happening to the average
cost here? It must be the case that as long as IRS operates, average cost falls as
the firm increases output.
DRS implies that if we want to increase the output by a certain proportion,
inputs need to be increased by more than that proportion. As a result, cost also
increases by more than that proportion. So, as long as DRS operates, the average
cost must be rising as the firm increases output.
CRS implies a proportional increase in inputs resulting in a proportional
increase in output. So the average cost remains constant as long as CRS operates.
It is argued that in a typical firm IRS is observed at the initial level of
production. This is then followed by the CRS and then by the DRS. Accordingly,
the LRAC curve is a ‘U’-shaped curve. Its downward sloping part corresponds
to IRS and upward rising part corresponds to DRS. At the minimum point of the
LRAC curve, CRS is observed.
Let us check how the LRMC curve looks like. For the first unit of output,
both LRMC and LRAC are the same. Then, as output increases, LRAC initially
falls, and then, after a certain point, it rises. As long as average cost is falling,
marginal cost must be less than the average cost. When the average cost is rising,
marginal cost must be greater
than the average cost. LRMC
curve is therefore a ‘U’-shaped
curve. It cuts the LRAC curve from
below at the minimum point of the
LRAC. Figure 3.9 shows the
shapes of the long run marginal
cost and the long run average cost
curves for a typical firm.
LRAC reaches its minimum
at q1. To the left of q1, LRAC is
falling and LRMC is less than the
LRAC curve. To the right of q1,
LRAC is rising and LRMC is
higher than LRAC.

For different combinations of inputs, the production function shows the maximum
quantity of output that can be produced.
In the short run, some inputs cannot be varied. In the long run, all inputs can be
varied.
Total product is the relationship between a variable input and output when all
other inputs are held constant.
For any level of employment of an input, the sum of marginal products of every
unit of that input up to that level gives the total product of that input at that
employment level.
Both the marginal product and the average product curves are inverse ‘U’-shaped.
The marginal product curve cuts the average product curve from above at the
maximum point of average product curve.
In order to produce output, the firm chooses least cost input combinations.
Total cost is the sum of total variable cost and the total fixed cost.
Average cost is the sum of average variable cost and average fixed cost.
Average fixed cost curve is downward sloping.
Short run marginal cost, average variable cost and short run average cost curves
are ‘U’-shaped.
SMC curve cuts the AVC curve from below at the minimum point of AVC.
SMC curve cuts the SAC curve from below at the minimum point of SAC.
In the short run, for any level of output, sum of marginal costs up to that level
gives us the total variable cost. The area under the SMC curve up to any level of
output gives us the total variable cost up to that level.
Both LRAC and LRMC curves are ‘U’ shaped.

In the previous chapter, we studied concepts related to a firm’s
production function and cost curves. The focus of this chapter is
different. Here we ask : how does a firm decide how much to
produce? Our answer to this question is by no means simple or
uncontroversial. We base our answer on a critical, if somewhat
unreasonable, assumption about firm behaviour – a firm, we
maintain, is a ruthless profit maximiser. So, the amount that a
firm produces and sells in the market is that which maximises
its profit.
The structure of this chapter is as follows. We first set up and
examine in detail the profit maximisation problem of a firm. This
done, we derive a firm’s supply curve. The supply curve shows
the levels of output that a firm chooses to produce for different
values of the market price. Finally, we study how to aggregate
the supply curves of individual firms and obtain the market
supply curve.
4.1 PERFECT COMPETITION: DEFINING FEATURES
In order to analyse a firm’s profit maximisation problem, we
must first specify the market environment in which the firm
functions. In this chapter, we study a market environment called
perfect competition. A perfectly competitive market has two
defining features
1. The market consists of buyers and sellers (that is, firms). All
firms in the market produce a certain homogeneous (that is,
undifferentiated) good.
2. Each buyer and seller in the market is a price-taker.
Since the first feature of a perfectly competitive market is
easy to understand, we focus on the second feature. From the
viewpoint of a firm, what does price-taking entail? A price-taking
firm believes that should it set a price above the market price, it
will be unable to sell any quantity of the good that it produces.
On the other hand, should the set price be less than or equal to
the market price, the firm can sell as many units of the good as
it wants to sell. From the viewpoint of a buyer, what does price-
taking entail? A buyer would obviously like to buy the good at
the lowest possible price. However, a price-taking buyer believes
that should she ask for a price below the market price, no firm

will be willing to sell to her. On the other hand, should the price asked be
greater than or equal to the market price, the buyer can obtain as many
units of the good as she desires to buy.
Since this chapter deals exclusively with firms, we probe no further into
buyer behaviour. Instead, we identify conditions under which price-taking is
a reasonable assumption for firms. Price-taking is often thought to be a
reasonable assumption when the market has many firms and buyers have
perfect information about the price prevailing in the market. Why? Let us start
with a situation wherein each firm in the market charges the same (market)
price and sells some amount of the good. Suppose, now, that a certain firm
raises its price above the market price. Observe that since all firms produce
the same good and all buyers are aware of the market price, the firm in question
loses all its buyers. Furthermore, as these buyers switch their purchases to
other firms, no “adjustment” problems arise; their demands are readily
accommodated when there are many firms in the market. Recall, now, that an
individual firm’s inability to sell any amount of the good at a price exceeding
the market price is precisely what the price-taking assumption stipulates.
4.2 REVENUE
We have indicated that in a perfectly competitive market, a firm believes that
it can sell as many units of the good as it wants by setting a price less than or
equal to the market price. But, if this is the case, surely there is no reason to
set a price lower than the market price. In other words, should the firm desire
to sell some amount of the good, the price that it sets is exactly equal to the
market price.
A firm earns revenue by selling the good that it produces in the market. Let
the market price of a unit of the good be p. Let q be the quantity of the good
produced, and therefore sold, by the firm at price p. Then, total revenue (TR) of
the firm is defined as the market price of the good (p) multiplied by the firm’s
output (q). Hence,
TR = p × q
To make matters concrete, consider the following numerical example. Let
the market for candles be perfectly competitive and let the market price of a
box of candles be Rs 10. For a candle manufacturer, Table 4.1 shows how
total revenue is related to output. Notice that when no box is produced,
TR is equal to zero; if one box of candles is produced, TR is equal to 1 × Rs 10
= Rs 10; if two boxes of candles are produced, TR is equal to 2 × Rs 10
= Rs 20; and so on.
With the example done, let us return to a more general setting. In a perfectly
competitive market, a firm views the market price, p, as given. With the market
price fixed at p, the total revenue curve of a
firm shows the relationship between its total
revenue (y-axis) and its output (x-axis). Figure
4.1 shows the total revenue curve of a firm.
Three observations are relevant here. First,
when the output is zero, the total revenue of
the firm is also zero. Therefore, the TR curve
passes through point O. Second, the total
revenue increases as the output goes up.
Moreover, the equation ‘TR = p  × q’ is that of a
Boxes sold

straight line. This means that the
TR curve is an upward rising
straight line. Third, consider the
slope of this straight line. When
the output is one unit (horizontal
distance Oq1 in Figure 4.1), the
total revenue (vertical height
Aq1 in Figure 4.1) is p × 1 = p.
Therefore, the slope of the
straight line is Aq1/Oq1 = p.
Now consider Figure 4.2.
Here, we plot the market price
(y-axis) for different values of a
firm’s output (x-axis). Since the
market price is fixed at p, we
obtain a horizontal straight line
that cuts the y-axis at a height
equal to p. This horizontal
straight line is called the price
line. The price line also depicts
the demand curve facing a firm.
Observe that Figure 4.2 shows
that the market price, p, is
independent of a firm’s output.
This means that a firm can sell
as many units of the good as it
wants to sell at price p.
The average revenue ( AR )
of a firm is defined as total
revenue per unit of output.
Recall that if a firm’s output is q
and the market price is p, then
TR equals p × q. Hence
AR = TR
q  = p
In other words, for a price-taking
firm, average revenue equals the
market price.
The marginal revenue (MR) of a firm is defined as the increase in total revenue
for a unit increase in the firm’s output. Consider a situation where the firm’s
output is increased from q0 to (q0 + 1). Given market price p, notice that
MR = (TR from output (q0 + 1)) – (TR from output q0)
= (p × (q0 + 1)) – (pq0) = p
In other words, for a price-taking firm, marginal revenue equals the
market price.
Setting the algebra aside, the intuition for this result is quite simple. When
a firm increases its output by one unit, this extra unit is sold at the market
price. Hence, the firm’s increase in total revenue from the one-unit output
expansion – that is, MR – is precisely the market price.
Price Line. The price line shows the relationship
between the market price and a firm’s output level.
The vertical height of the price line is equal to the
market price, p.
Total Revenue curve. The total revenue curve of
a firm shows the relationship between the total
revenue that the firm earns and the output level of
the firm. The slope of the curve, Aq1/Oq1, is the
market price.

4.3 PROFIT MAXIMISATION
A firm produces and sells a certain amount of a good. The firm’s profit, denoted
by π, is defined to be the difference between its total revenue (TR) and its total
cost of production (TC ).1 In other words
π = TR – TC
Clearly, the gap between TR and TC is the firm’s earnings net of costs.
A firm wishes to maximise its profit. The critical question is: at what output
level is the firm’s profit maximised? Assuming that the firm’s output is perfectly
divisible, we now show that if there is a positive output level, q0, at which profit
is maximised, then three conditions must hold:
1. The market price, p, is equal to the marginal cost at q0.
2. The marginal cost is non-decreasing at q0.
3. In the short run, the market price, p, must be greater than or equal to the
average variable cost at q0. In the long run, the market price, p, must be
greater than or equal to the average cost at q0.
4.3.1 Condition 1
Consider condition 1. We show that condition 1 is true by arguing that a profit-
maximising firm will not produce at an output level where market price exceeds
marginal cost or marginal cost exceeds market price. We check both the cases.
Case 1: Price greater than MC is ruled out
Consider Figure 4.3 and note that at the output level q2, the market price, p,
exceeds the marginal cost. We claim that q2 cannot be a profit-maximising output
level. Why?
Observe that for all output levels slightly to the right of q2, the market price
continues to exceed the marginal cost. So, pick an output level q3 slightly to the
right of q2 such that the market price exceeds the marginal cost for all output
levels between q2 and q3.
Suppose, now, that the firm increases its output level from q2 to q3. The
increase in the total revenue of the firm from this output expansion is just
the market price multiplied by the change in quantity; that is, the area of the
rectangle q2q3CB. On the other hand, the increase in total cost associated
with this output expansion is just the area under the marginal cost curve
between output levels q2 and q3; that is, the area of the region q2q3XW. But, a
comparison of the two areas shows that the firm’s profit is higher when its
output level is q3 rather than q2. But, if this is the case, q2 cannot be a profit-
maximising output level.
Case 2: Price less than MC is ruled out
Consider Figure 4.3 and note that at the output level q5, the market price, p, is
less than the marginal cost. We claim that q5 cannot be a profit-maximising
output level. Why?
Observe that for all output levels slightly to the left of q5, the market price
remains lower than the marginal cost. So, pick an output level q4 slightly to the
left of q5 such that the market price is less than the marginal cost for all output
levels between q4 and q5.
Suppose, now, that the firm cuts its output level from q5 to q4. The decrease
in the total revenue of the firm from this output contraction is just the market

price multiplied by the change in quantity; that is, the area of the rectangle
q4q5EF. On the other hand, the decrease in total cost brought about by this
output contraction is the area under the marginal cost curve between output
levels q4 and q5; that is, the area of the region q4 q5 ZY. But, a comparison of the
two areas shows that the firm’s profit is higher when its output level is q4 rather
than q5. But, if this is the case, q5 cannot be a profit-maximising output level.
4.3.2 Condition 2
Consider the second condition
that must hold when the profit-
maximising output level is
positive. Why is it the case that
the marginal cost curve cannot
slope downwards at the profit-
maximising output level? To
answer this question, refer once
again to Figure 4.3. Note that at
the output level q1, the market
price is equal to the marginal cost;
however, the marginal cost curve
is downward sloping. We claim
that q1 cannot be a profit-
maximising output level. Why?
Observe that for all output
levels slightly to the left of q1,
the market price is lower than
the marginal cost. But, the
argument outlined in case 2 of section 3.1 immediately implies that the firm’s
profit at an output level slightly smaller than q1 exceeds that corresponding to the
output level q1. This being the
case, q1 cannot be a profit-
maximising output level.
4.3.3 Condition 3
Consider the third condition that
must hold when the profit-
maximising output level is
positive. Notice that the third
condition has two parts: one part
applies in the short run while the
other applies in the long run.
Case 1: Price must be greater
than or equal to AVC in the
short run
We will show that the statement of
Case 1 (see above) is true by
arguing that a profit-maximising
firm, in the short run, will not
produce at an output level wherein
the market price is lower than
the AVC.
Conditions 1 and 2 for profit maximisation.
The figure is used to demonstrate that when the
market price is p, the output level of a profit-
maximising firm cannot be q1 (marginal cost
curve, MC, is downward sloping), q2 (market
price exceeds marginal cost), or q5 (marginal cost
exceeds market price).
Price-AVC Relationship with Profit
Maximisation (Short Run).  The figure is used
to demonstrate that a profit-maximising firm
produces zero output in the short run when the
market price, p, is less than the minimum of its
average variable cost (AVC). If the firm’s output
level is q1, the firm’s total variable cost exceeds
its revenue by an amount equal to the area of
rectangle pEBA.

The Theory of the Firm
under Perfect Competition
Let us turn to Figure 4.4. Observe that at the output level q1, the market
price p is lower than the AVC. We claim that q1 cannot be a profit-maximising
output level. Why?
Notice that the firm’s total revenue at q1 is as follows
TR = Price × Quantity
= Vertical height Op × width Oq1
= The area of rectangle OpAq1
Similarly, the firm’s total variable cost at q1 is as follows
TVC = Average variable cost × Quantity
= Vertical height OE × Width Oq1
= The area of rectangle OEBq1
Now recall that the firm’s profit at q1 is TR – (TVC + TFC); that is, [the area of
rectangle OpAq1] – [the area of rectangle OEBq1] – TFC. What happens if the
firm produces zero output? Since output is zero, TR and TVC are zero as well.
Hence, the firm’s profit at zero output is equal to – TFC. But, the area of rectangle
OpAq1 is strictly less than the area of rectangle OEBq1. Hence, the firm’s profit
at q1 is strictly less than what it obtains by not producing at all. This means, of
course, that q1 cannot be a profit-maximising output level.
Case 2: Price must be greater than or equal to AC in the long run
We will show that the statement of Case 2 (see above) is true by arguing that a
profit-maximising firm, in the long run, will not produce at an output level
wherein the market price is lower than the AC.
Let us turn to Figure 4.5.
Observe that at the output level
q1, the market price p is lower than
the (long run) AC. We claim that
q1 cannot be a profit-maximising
output level. Why?
Notice that the firm’s total
revenue, TR, at q1 is the area of
the rectangle OpAq1 (the product
of price and quantity) while the
firm’s total cost, TC , is the area
of the rectangle OEBq1 (the
product of average cost and
quantity). Since the area of
rectangle OEBq1 is larger than the
area of rectangle OpAq1, the firm
incurs a loss at the output level
q1. But, in the long run set-up, a
firm that shuts down production
has a profit of zero. This means,
of course, that q1 is not a profit-
maximising output level.
4.3.4 The Profit Maximisation Problem: Graphical Representation
Using the material in sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, let us graphically represent a
firm’s profit maximisation problem in the short run. Consider Figure 4.6. Notice

to demonstrate that a profit-maximising firm
produces zero output in the long run when the
market price, p, is less than the minimum of its

level is q1, the firm’s total cost exceeds its revenue
by an amount equal to the area of rectangle pEBA.

that the market price is p. Equating the market price with the (short run)
marginal cost, we obtain the
output level q0. At q0, observe that
SMC slopes upwards and p
exceeds AVC. Since the three
conditions discussed in sections
3.1-3.3 are satisfied at q0, we
maintain that the profit-
maximising output level of the
firm is q0.
What happens at q0? The total
revenue of the firm at q0 is the
area of rectangle OpAq0 (the
product of price and quantity)
while the total cost at q0 is the
area of rectangle OEBq0 (the
product of short run average cost
and quantity). So, at q0, the firm
earns a profit equal to the area of
the rectangle EpAB.
4.4 SUPPLY CURVE OF A FIRM
The supply curve of a firm shows the levels of output (plotted on the x-axis)
that the firm chooses to produce corresponding to different values of the market
price (plotted on the y-axis). Of course, for a given market price, the output level
of a profit-maximising firm will depend on whether we are considering the short
run or the long run. Accordingly, we distinguish between the short run supply
curve and the long run supply curve.
4.4.1 Short Run Supply Curve of a Firm
Let us turn to Figure 4.7 and
derive a firm’s short run supply
curve. We shall split this
derivation into two parts. We first
determine a firm’s profit-
maximising output level when the
market price is greater than or
equal to the minimum AVC. This
done, we determine the firm’s
profit-maximising output level
when the market price is less than
the minimum AVC.
Case 1: Price is greater than
or equal to the minimum AVC
Suppose the market price is p1,
which exceeds the minimum AVC.
We start out by equating p1 with
SMC on the rising part of the SMC
curve; this leads to the output level
q1. Note also that the AVC at q1

Maximisation (Short Run). Given market
price p, the output level of a profit-maximising
firm is q0. At q0, the firm’s profit is equal to
the area of rectangle EpAB.
Market Price Values. The figure shows the
output levels chosen by a profit-maximising firm
in the short run for two values of the market price:
p1 and p2. When the market price is p1, the output
level of the firm is q1; when the market price is
p2, the firm produces zero output.

The Theory of the Firm
under Perfect Competition
does not exceed the market price, p1. Thus, all three conditions highlighted in
section 3 are satisfied at q1. Hence, when the market price is p1, the firm’s output
level in the short run is equal to q1.
Case 2: Price is less than the minimum AVC
Suppose the market price is p2, which is less than the minimum AVC. We have
argued (see condition 3 in section 3) that if a profit-maximising firm produces a
positive output in the short run, then the market price, p2, must be greater than
or equal to the AVC at that output
level. But notice from Figure 4.7
that for all positive output levels,
AVC strictly exceeds p2. In other
words, it cannot be the case that
the firm supplies a positive output.
So, if the market price is p2, the
firm produces zero output.
Combining cases 1 and 2, we
reach an important conclusion. A
firm’s short run supply curve is
the rising part of the SMC curve
from and above the minimum AVC
together with zero output for all
prices strictly less than the
minimum AVC. In figure 4.8, the
bold line represents the short run
supply curve of the firm.
4.4.2 Long Run Supply Curve of a Firm
Let us turn to Figure 4.9 and derive the firm’s long run supply curve. As in the
short run case, we split the derivation into two parts. We first determine the
firm’s profit-maximising output
level when the market price is
greater than or equal to the
minimum (long run) AC. This
done, we determine the firm’s
profit-maximising output level
when the market price is less than
the minimum (long run) AC.
Case 1: Price greater than or
equal to the minimum LRAC
Suppose the market price is p1,
which exceeds the minimum
LRAC. Upon equating p1 with
LRMC on the rising part of the
LRMC curve, we obtain output
level q1. Note also that the LRAC
at q1 does not exceed the market
price, p 1. Thus, all three
conditions highlighted in
section 3 are satisfied at q1.
The Short Run Supply Curve of a Firm. The
short run supply curve of a firm, which is based
on its short run marginal cost curve (SMC) and
average variable cost curve (AVC), is represented
by the bold line.
Profit maximisation in the Long Run for
Different Market Price Values. The figure
shows the output levels chosen by a profit-
maximising firm in the long run for two values
of the market price: p1 and p2. When the market
price is p1, the output level of the firm is q1;
when the market price is p2, the firm produces
zero output.

Introductory Microeconomics
Hence, when the market price is p1, the firm’s supplies in the long run become
an output equal to q1.
Case 2: Price less than the minimum LRAC
Suppose the market price is p2, which is less than the minimum LRAC. We have
argued (see condition 3 in section 3) that if a profit-maximising firm produces a
positive output in the long run, the market price, p2, must be greater than or
equal to the LRAC at that output
level. But notice from Figure 4.9
that for all positive output levels,
LRAC strictly exceeds p2. In other
words, it cannot be the case that
the firm supplies a positive
output. So, when the market price
is p2, the firm produces zero
output.
Combining cases 1 and 2, we
reach an important conclusion. A
firm’s long run supply curve is the
rising part of the LRMC curve from
and above the minimum LRAC
together with zero output for all
prices less than the minimum
LRAC. In Figure 4.10, the bold line
represents the long run supply
curve of the firm.
4.4.3 The Shut Down Point
Previously, while deriving the supply curve, we have discussed that in the short
run the firm continues to produce as long as the price remains greater than or
equal to the minimum of AVC. Therefore, along the supply curve as we move
down, the last price-output combination at which the firm produces positive
output is the point of minimum AVC where the SMC curve cuts the AVC curve.
Below this, there will be no production. This point is called the short run shut
down point of the firm. In the long run, however, the shut down point is the
minimum of LRAC curve.
4.4.4 The Normal Profit and Break-even Point
A firm uses different kinds of inputs in the production process. To acquire some
of them, the firm has to pay directly. For example, if a firm employs labour it has
to pay wages to them; if it uses some raw materials, it has to buy them. There
may be some other kinds of inputs which the firm owns, and therefore, does not
need to pay to anybody for them. These inputs though do not involve any explicit
cost, they involve some opportunity cost to the firm. The firm instead of using
these inputs in the current production process could have used them for some
other purpose and get some return. This forgone return is the opportunity cost
to the firm. The firm normally expects to earn a profit that along with the explicit
costs can also cover the opportunity costs. The profit level that is just enough to
cover the explicit costs and opportunity costs of the firm is called the normal
profit. If a firm includes both its explicit costs and opportunity costs in the
calculation of total cost, the normal profit becomes that level of profit when total

its long run marginal cost curve (LRMC) and long
run average cost curve (LRAC), is represented by

under Perfect Competition
revenue equals total cost, i.e., the zero level of profit. Profit that a firm earns over
and above the normal profit is called the super-normal profit. In the long run,
a firm does not produce if it earns anything less than the normal profit. In the
short run, however, it may produce even if the profit is less than this level. The
point on the supply curve at which a firm earns normal profit is called the
break-even point of the firm. The point of minimum average cost at which the
supply curve cuts the LRAC curve (in short run, SAC curve) is therefore the
break-even point of a firm.
Opportunity cost
In economics, one often encounters the concept of opportunity cost.
Opportunity cost of some activity is the gain foregone from the second best
activity. Suppose you have Rs 1,000 which you decide to invest in your
family business. What is the opportunity cost of your action? If you do not
invest this money, you can either keep it in the house-safe which will give
you zero return or you can deposit it in either bank-1 or
bank-2 in which case you get an interest at the rate of 10 per cent or 5 per
cent respectively. So the maximum benefit that you may get from other
alternative activities is the interest from the bank-1. But this opportunity
will no longer be there once you invest the money in your family business.
The opportunity cost of investing the money in your family business is
therefore the amount of forgone interest from the bank-1.
4.5 DETERMINANTS OF A FIRM’S SUPPLY CURVE
In the previous section, we have seen that a firm’s supply curve is a part of its
marginal cost curve. Thus, any factor that affects a firm’s marginal cost curve is
of course a determinant of its supply curve. In this section, we discuss three
such factors.
4.5.1 Technological Progress
Suppose a firm uses two factors of production – say, capital and labour – to
produce a certain good. Subsequent to an organisational innovation by the firm,
the same levels of capital and labour now produce more units of output. Put
differently, to produce a given level of output, the organisational innovation allows
the firm to use fewer units of inputs. It is expected that this will lower the firm’s
marginal cost at any level of output; that is, there is a rightward (or downward)
shift of the MC curve. As the firm’s supply curve is essentially a segment of the
MC curve, technological progress shifts the supply curve of the firm to the right.
At any given market price, the firm now supplies more units of output.
4.5.2 Input Prices
A change in input prices also affects a firm’s supply curve. If the price of an
input (say, the wage rate of labour) increases, the cost of production rises. The
consequent increase in the firm’s average cost at any level of output is usually
accompanied by an increase in the firm’s marginal cost at any level of output;
that is, there is a leftward (or upward) shift of the MC curve. This means that the
firm’s supply curve shifts to the left: at any given market price, the firm now
supplies fewer units of output.

4.5.3 Unit Tax
A unit tax is a tax that the
government imposes per unit sale
of output. For example, suppose
that the unit tax imposed by the
government is Rs 2. Then, if the
firm produces and sells 10 units
of the good, the total tax that the
firm must pay to the government
is 10 × Rs 2 = Rs 20.
How does the long run supply
curve of a firm change when a unit
tax is imposed? Let us turn to
figure 4.11. Before the unit tax is
imposed, LRMC0 and LRAC0 are,
respectively, the long run
marginal cost curve and the long
run average cost curve of the firm.
Now, suppose the government
puts in place a unit tax of Rs t.
Since the firm must pay an extra
Rs t for each unit of the good
produced, the firm’s long run average cost and long run marginal cost at any
level of output increases by Rs t. In Figure 4.11, LRMC1 and LRAC1 are,
respectively, the long run marginal cost curve and the long run average cost
curve of the firm upon
imposition of the unit tax.
Recall that the long run
supply curve of a firm is the
rising part of the LRMC curve
from and above the minimum
LRAC together with zero output
for all prices less than the
minimum LRAC. Using this
observation in Figure 4.12, it is
immediate that S0 and S1 are,
respectively, the long run
supply curve of the firm before
and after the imposition of the
unit tax. Notice that the unit tax
shifts the firm’s long run supply
curve to the left: at any given
market price, the firm now
supplies fewer units of output.
4.6 MARKET SUPPLY CURVE
The market supply curve shows the output levels (plotted on the x-axis) that
firms in the market produce in aggregate corresponding to different values of
the market price (plotted on the y-axis).
How is the market supply curve derived? Consider a market with n firms:
firm 1, firm 2, firm 3, and so on. Suppose the market price is fixed at p. Then,
Cost Curves and the Unit Tax. LRAC0 and
LRMC0 are, respectively, the long run average cost
curve and the long run marginal cost curve of a

after a unit tax of Rs t is imposed.

the output produced by the n firms in aggregate is [supply of firm 1 at price p]
+ [supply of firm 2 at price p] + ... + [supply of firm n at price p]. In other words,
the market supply at price p is the summation of the supplies of individual
firms at that price.
Let us now construct the market supply curve geometrically with just two
firms in the market: firm 1 and firm 2. The two firms have different cost structures.
Firm 1 will not produce anything if the market price is less than
p  while firm 2
will not produce anything if the market price is less than
p . Assume also that
p  is greater than
In panel (a) of Figure 4.13 we have the supply curve of firm 1, denoted by
S1; in panel (b), we have the supply curve of firm 2, denoted by S2. Panel (c) of
Figure 4.13 shows the market supply curve, denoted by Sm. When the market
price is strictly below
p , both firms choose not to produce any amount of the
good; hence, market supply will also be zero for all such prices. For a market
price greater than or equal to
p  but strictly less than
p , only firm 1 will produce
a positive amount of the good. Therefore, in this range, the market supply curve
coincides with the supply curve of firm 1. For a market price greater than or
equal to
p , both firms will have positive output levels. For example, consider a
situation wherein the market price assumes the value p3 (observe that p3
exceeds
p ). Given p3, firm 1 supplies q3 units of output while firm 2 supplies q4
units of output. So, the market supply at price p3 is q5, where q5 = q3 + q4. Notice
how the market supply curve, Sm, in panel (c) is being constructed: we obtain Sm
by taking a horizontal summation of the supply curves of the two firms in the
market, S1 and S2.
It should be noted that the market supply curve has been derived for a fixed
number of firms in the market. As the number of firms changes, the market
supply curve shifts as well. Specifically, if the number of firms in the market
increases (decreases), the market supply curve shifts to the right (left).
We now supplement the graphical analysis given above with a related
numerical example. Consider a market with two firms: firm 1 and firm 2. Let the
supply curve of firm 1 be as follows
S1(p) =
– 10 :
The Market Supply Curve Panel. (a) shows the supply curve of firm 1. Panel (b) shows the
supply curve of firm 2. Panel (c) shows the market supply curve, which is obtained by taking
a horizontal summation of the supply curves of the two firms.

Notice that S1(p) indicates that (1) firm 1 produces an output of 0 if the market
price, p, is strictly less than 10, and (2) firm 1 produces an output of (p – 10) if
the market price, p, is greater than or equal to 10. Let the supply curve of firm 2
be as follows
S2(p) =
– 15 :
The interpretation of S2(p) is identical to that of S1(p), and is, hence, omitted.
Now, the market supply curve, Sm(p), simply sums up the supply curves of the
two firms; in other words
Sm(p) = S1(p) + S2(p)

4.7 PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY
The price elasticity of supply of a good measures the responsiveness of quantity
supplied to changes in the price of the good. More specifically, the price elasticity
of supply, denoted by eS, is defined as follows
Price elasticity of supply (eS) = Percentage change in quantity supplied
Percentage change in price
Given the market supply curve of a good (that is, Sm(p)), let q0 be the quantity
of the good supplied to the market when its market price is p0. For some reason,
the market price of the good changes from p0 to p1. Let q1 be the quantity of
the good supplied to the market when the market price is p1. Notice that
when the market price moves from p0 to p1, the percentage change in price is
100 ×
; similarly, when the quantity supplied moves from q0 to q1,
the percentage change in quantity supplied is 100 ×
To make matters concrete, consider the following numerical example. Suppose
the market for cricket balls is perfectly competitive. When the price of a cricket ball
is Rs10, let us assume that 200 cricket balls are produced in aggregate by the firms
in the market. When the price of a cricket ball rises to Rs 30, let us assume that 1,000
cricket balls are produced in aggregate by the firms in the market. Then

The Theory of the Firm
under Perfect Competition
When the supply curve is vertical, supply is completely insensitive to price
and the elasticity of supply is zero. In other cases, when supply curve is
positively sloped, with a rise in price, supply rises and hence, the elasticity of
supply is positive. Like the price elasticity of demand, the price elasticity of
supply is also independent of units.
4.7.1 The Geometric Method
Consider the Figure 4.11. Panel (a) shows a straight line supply curve. S is a point
on the supply curve. It cuts the price-axis at its positive range and as we extend
the straight line, it cuts the quantity-axis at M which is at its negative range. The
price elasticity of this supply curve at the point S is given by the ratio, Mq0/Oq0.
For any point S on such a supply curve, we see that Mq0 > Oq0. The elasticity at
any point on such a supply curve, therefore, will be greater than 1.
In panel (c) we consider a straight line supply curve and S is a point on it. It
cuts the quantity-axis at M which is at its positive range. Again the price elasticity
of this supply curve at the point S is given by the ratio, Mq0/Oq0. Now, Mq0 < Oq0
and hence, eS < 1. S can be any point on the supply curve, and therefore at all
points on such a supply curve eS < 1.
Now we come to panel (b). Here the supply curve goes through the origin.
One can imagine that the point M has coincided with the origin here, i.e., Mq0
has become equal to Oq0. The price elasticity of this supply curve at the point S
is given by the ratio, Oq0/Oq0 which is equal to 1. At any point on a straight line,
supply curve going through the origin price elasticity will be one.
Price Elasticity Associated with Straight Line Supply Curves. In panel (a), price elasticity
(eS) at S is greater than 1. In panel (b), price elasticity (eS) at S is equal to 1. In panel (c), price
elasticity (eS) at S is less than 1.
In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price-takers.
The total revenue of a firm is the market price of the good multiplied by the firm’s
output of the good.
For a price-taking firm, average revenue is equal to market price.
For a price-taking firm, marginal revenue is equal to market price.
The demand curve that a firm faces in a perfectly competitive market is perfectly
elastic; it is a horizontal straight line at the market price.
The profit of a firm is the difference between total revenue earned and total cost
incurred.

This chapter will be built on the foundation laid down in Chapters
2 and 4 where we studied the consumer and firm behaviour when
they are price takers. In Chapter 2, we have seen that an
individual’s demand curve for a commodity tells us what quantity
a consumer is willing to buy at different prices when he takes price
as given. The market demand curve in turn tells us how much of
the commodity all the consumers taken together are willing to
purchase at different prices when everyone takes price as given.
In Chapter 4, we have seen that an individual firm’s supply curve
tells us the quantity of the commodity that a profit-maximising
firm would wish to sell at different prices when it takes price as
given and the market supply curve tells us how much of the
commodity all the firms taken together would wish to supply at
different prices when each firm takes price as given.
In this chapter, we combine both consumers’ and firms’
behaviour to study market equilibrium through demand-supply
analysis and determine at what price equilibrium will be attained.
We also examine the effects of demand and supply shifts on
equilibrium. At the end of the chapter, we will look at some of the
applications of demand-supply analysis.
5.1 EQUILIBRIUM, EXCESS DEMAND, EXCESS SUPPLY
A perfectly competitive market consists of buyers and sellers who
are driven by their self-interested objectives. Recall from Chapters
2 and 4 that objectives of the consumers are to maximise their
respective preference and that of the firms are to maximise their
respective profits. Both the consumers’ and firms’ objectives are
compatible in the equilibrium.
An equilibrium is defined as a situation where the plans of all
consumers and firms in the market match and the market clears.
In equilibrium, the aggregate quantity that all firms wish to sell
equals the quantity that all the consumers in the market wish to
buy; in other words, market supply equals market demand. The
price at which equilibrium is reached is called equilibrium price
and the quantity bought and sold at this price is called equilibrium
quantity. Therefore, (p*, q*) is an equilibrium if
qD(p∗) = qS(p∗)
© NCERT

Introductory Microeconomics
where p∗ denotes the equilibrium price and qD(p∗) and qS(p∗) denote the market
demand and market supply of the commodity respectively at price p∗.
If at a price, market supply is greater than market demand, we say that
there is an excess supply in the market at that price and if market demand
exceeds market supply at a price, it is said that excess demand exists in the
market at that price. Therefore, equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market
can be defined alternatively as zero excess demand-zero excess supply situation.
Whenever market supply is not equal to market demand, and hence the market
is not in equilibrium, there will be a tendency for the price to change. In the next
two sections, we will try to understand what drives this change.
Out-of-equilibrium Behaviour
From the time of Adam Smith (1723-1790), it has been maintained that in
a perfectly competitive market an ‘Invisible Hand’ is at play which changes
price whenever there is imbalance in the market. Our intuition also tells us
that this ‘Invisible Hand’ should raise the prices in case of ‘excess demand’
and lower the prices in case of ‘excess supply’. Throughout our analysis we
shall maintain that the ‘Invisible Hand’ plays this very important role.
Moreover, we shall take it that the ‘Invisible Hand’ by following this process
is able to reach the equilibrium. This assumption will be taken to hold in all
that we discuss in the text.
5.1.1 Market Equilibrium: Fixed Number of Firms
Recall that in Chapter 2 we have derived the market demand curve for price-
taking consumers, and for price-taking firms the market supply curve was
derived in Chapter 4 under the assumption of a fixed number of firms. In this
section with the help of these two curves we will look at how supply and demand
forces work together to determine where the market will be in equilibrium when
the number of firms is fixed. We will also study how the equilibrium price and
quantity change due to shifts in demand and supply curves.
Figure 5.1 illustrates equilibrium
for a perfectly competitive market
with a fixed number of firms. Here
SS denotes the market supply
curve and DD denotes the market
demand curve for a commodity.
The market supply curve SS
shows
commodity firms would wish to
supply at different prices, and the
demand curve DD tells us how
much of the commodity, the
consumers would be willing to
purchase at different prices.
Graphically, an equilibrium is a
point where the market supply
curve intersects the market
demand curve because this is
where the market demand equals
market supply. At any other point,
either there is excess supply or
Market Equilibrium with Fixed Number of
Firms. Equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the
market demand curve DD and market supply curve
SS. The equilibrium quantity is q* and the equilibrium
price is p*. At a price greater than p*, there will be
excess supply, and at a price below p*, there will be
excess demand.

Market Equilibrium
there is excess demand. To see what happens when market demand does not
equal market supply, let us look, in Figure 5.1, at any price at which the equality
does not hold.
In Figure 5.1, if the prevailing price is p1, the market demand is q1 whereas
the market supply is
q'  . Therefore, there is excess demand in the market equal
q' q1. Some consumers who are either unable to obtain the commodity at all
or obtain it in insufficient quantity will be willing to pay more than p1. The market
price would tend to increase. All other things remaining constant as price rises,
quantity demanded falls, quantity supplied increases and the market moves
towards the point where the quantity that the firms want to sell is equal to the
quantity that the consumers want to buy. At p* ,the supply decisions of the firms
match with the demand decisions of the consumers.
Similarly, if the prevailing price is p2, the market supply (q2) will exceed the
market demand (
q '  ) at that price giving rise to excess supply equal to
q ' q2.
Under such a circumstance, some firms will not be able to sell their desired
quantity; so, they will lower their price. All other things remaining constant as
price falls, quantity demanded rises, quantity supplied falls, and at p*, the firms
are able to sell their desired output since market demand equals market supply
at that price. Therefore, p* is the equilibrium price and the corresponding
quantity q* is the equilibrium quantity.
To understand the equilibrium price and quantity determination more
clearly, let us explain it through an example.
EXAMPLE
Let us consider the example of a market consisting of identical1 farms producing
same quality of wheat. Suppose the market demand curve and the market supply
curve for wheat are given by:
qD = 200 – p
for 0 ≤ p ≤ 200
for p > 200
qS = 120 + p for p ≥ 10
for 0 ≤ p < 10
where qD and qS denote the demand for and supply of wheat (in kg) respectively
and p denotes the price of wheat per kg in rupees.
Since at equilibrium price market clears, we find the equilibrium price
(denoted by p*) by equating market demand and supply and solve for p*.
qD(p*) = qS(p*)
200 – p* = 120 + p*
Rearranging terms,
2p* = 80
p* = 40
Therefore, the equilibrium price of wheat is Rs 40 per kg. The equilibrium
quantity (denoted by q*) is obtained by substituting the equilibrium price into
either the demand or the supply curve’s equation since in equilibrium quantity
demanded and supplied are equal.
1Here, by identical we mean that all farms have same cost structure.

Introductory Microeconomics
qD = q* = 200 – 40 = 160
Alternatively,
qS = q* = 120 + 40 = 160
Thus, the equilibrium quantity is 160 kg.
At a price less than p*, say p1 = 25
qD = 200 – 25 = 175
qS = 120 + 25 = 145
Therefore, at p1 = 25, qD > qS which implies that there is excess demand at
this price.
Algebraically, excess demand (ED) can be expressed as
ED(p) = qD – qS
= 200 – p – (120 + p)
= 80 – 2p
Notice from the above expression that for any price less than p*(= 40), excess
demand will be positive.
Similarly, at a price greater than p*, say p2 = 45
qD = 200 – 45 = 155
qS = 120 + 45 = 165
Therefore, there is excess supply at this price since qS > qD. Algebraically,
excess supply (ES) can be expressed as
ES(p) = qS – qD
= 120 + p – (200 – p)
= 2p – 80
Notice from the above expression that for any price greater than p*(= 40),
excess supply will be positive.
Therefore, at any price greater than p*, there will be excess supply, and at
any price lower than p*,there will be excess demand.
Wage Determination in Labour Market
Here we will briefly discuss the theory of wage determination under a
perfectly competitive market structure using the demand-supply analysis.
The basic difference between a labour market and a market for goods is
with respect to the source of supply and demand. In the labour market,
households are the suppliers of labour and the demand for labour comes
from firms whereas in the market for goods, it is the opposite. Here, it is
important to point out that by labour, we mean the hours of work provided
by labourers and not the number of labourers. The wage rate is determined
at the intersection of the demand and supply curves of labour where the
demand for and supply of labour balance. We shall now see what the demand
and supply curves of labour look like.
To examine the demand for labour by a single firm, we assume that the
labour is the only variable factor of production and the labour market is
perfectly competitive, which in turn, implies that each firm takes wage rate
as given. Also, the firm we are concerned with, is perfectly competitive in

Market Equilibrium
nature and carries out production with the goal of profit maximisation. We
also assume that given the technology of the firm, the law of diminishing
marginal product holds.
The firm being a profit maximiser will always employ labour upto
the point where the extra cost she incurs for employing the last unit of
labour is equal to the additional benefit she earns from that unit. The
extra cost of hiring one more unit of labour is the wage rate (w). The
extra output produced by one more unit of labour is its marginal product
(MPL) and by selling each extra unit of output, the additional earning of
the firm is the marginal revenue (MR) she gets from that unit. Therefore,
for each extra unit of labour, she gets an additional benefit equal to
marginal revenue times marginal product which is called Marginal
Revenue Product of Labour (MRPL). Thus, while hiring labour, the firm
employs labour up to the point where
w = MRPL
and MRPL = MR × MPL
Since we are dealing with a perfectly competitive firm, marginal
revenue is equal to the price of the commoditya and hence marginal
revenue product of labour in this case is equal to the value of marginal
product of labour (VMPL).
As long as the VMPL is greater than the wage rate, the firm will earn
more profit by hiring one more unit of labour, and if at any level of labour
employment VMPL is less than the wage rate, the firm can increase her
profit by reducing a unit of labour employed.
Given the assumption of the law of diminishing marginal product,
the fact that the firm always produces at w = VMPL implies that the
demand curve for labour is downward sloping. To explain why it is so,
let us assume at some wage rate w1, demand for labour is l1. Now, suppose
the wage rate increases to w2. To maintain the wage-VMPL equality, VMPL
should also increase. The price of the commodity remaining
constantb, this is possible only
if MPL increases which in turn
implies that less labour
should be employed owing to
the diminishing marginal
productivity of labour. Hence,
at higher wage, less labour is
demanded thereby leading to a
downward sloping demand,
curve. To arrive at the market
demand curve from individual
firms’ demand curve, we simply
add up the demand for labour
by individual firms at different
wages and since each firm
demands less labour as wage
increases, the market demand
curve is also downward sloping.
Labour(in hrs)
Wage is determined at the point where the labour
demand and supply curves intersect.
aRecall from Chapter 4 that for a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue equals price.
bSince the firm under consideration is perfectly competitive, it believes it cannot influence
the price of the commodity.

Shifts in Demand and Supply
In the above section, we studied market equilibrium under the assumption
that tastes and preferences of the consumers, prices of the related
commodities, incomes of the consumers, technology, size of the market, prices
of the inputs used in production, etc remain constant. However, with changes
in one or more of these factors either the supply or the demand curve or both
may shift, thereby affecting the equilibrium price and quantity. Here, we first
develop the general theory which outlines the impact of these shifts on
equilibrium and then discuss the impact of changes in some of the above
mentioned factors on equilibrium.
Demand Shift
Consider Figure 5.2 in which we depict the impact of demand shift when the
number of firms is fixed. Here, the initial equilibrium point is E where the market
demand curve DD0 and the market supply curve SS0 intersect so that q0 and p0
are the equilibrium quantity and price respectively.
Having explored the demand side, we now turn to the supply side.
As already mentioned, it is the households which determine how much
labour to supply at a given wage rate. Their supply decision is essentially
a choice between income and leisure. On the one hand, individuals enjoy
leisure and find work irksome and on the other, they value income for
which they must work.
So there is a trade-off between enjoying leisure and spending more
hours for work. To derive the labour supply curve for a single individual,
let us assume at some wage rate w1, the individual supplies l1 units of
labour. Now suppose the wage rises to w2. This increase in wage rate will
have two effects: First, due to the increase in wage rate, the opportunity
cost of leisure increases which makes leisure costlier. Therefore, the
individual will want to enjoy less leisure. As a result, they will work for
longer hours. Second, because of the increase in wage rate to w2, the
purchasing power of the individual increases. So, she would want to
spend more on leisure activities. The final effect of the increase in wage
rate will depend on which of the two effects predominates. At low wage
rates, the first effect dominates the second and so the individual will be
willing to supply more labour with an increase in wage rate. But at high
wage rates, the second effect dominates the first and the individual will
be willing to supply less labour for every increase in wage rate. Thus, we
get a backward bending individual labour supply curve which shows
that up to a certain wage rate for every increase in wage rate, there is an
increased supply of labour. Beyond this wage rate for every increase in
wage rate, labour supply will decrease. Nevertheless, the market supply
curve of labour, which we obtain by aggregating individuals’ supply at
different wages, will be upward sloping because though at higher wages
some individuals may be willing to work less, many more individuals
will be attracted to supply more labour.
With an upward sloping supply curve and downward sloping demand
curve, the equilibrium wage rate is determined at the point where these two
curves intersect; in other words, where the labour that the households wish
to supply is equal to the labour that the firms wish to hire. This is shown in
the diagram.

Market Equilibrium
Now suppose the market demand curve shifts rightward to DD2 with supply
curve remaining unchanged at SS0, as shown in panel (a). This shift indicates
that at any price the quantity demanded is more than before. Therefore, at price
p0 now there is excess demand in the market equal to
q q'' . In response to this
excess demand some individuals will be willing to pay higher price and the price
would tend to rise. The new equilibrium is attained at G where the equilibrium
quantity q2 is greater than q0 and the equilibrium price p2 is greater than p0.
Similarly if the demand curve shifts leftward to DD1, as shown in panel (b), at
any price the quantity demanded will be less than what it was before the shift.
Therefore, at the initial equilibrium price p0 now there will be excess supply in
the market equal to
q' q  in response to which some firms will reduce the price
of their commodity so that they can sell their desired quantity. The new
equilibrium is attained at the point F at which the demand curve DD1 and the
supply curve SS0 intersect and the resulting equilibrium price p1 is less than p0
and quantity q1 is less than q0. Notice that the direction of change in equilibrium
price and quantity is same whenever there is a shift in demand curve.
Having developed the general theory, we now consider some examples to
understand how demand curve and the equilibrium quantity and price are
affected in response to a change in some of the aforementioned factors which
are also enlisted in Chapter 2. More specifically, we would analyse the impact
of increase in consumers’ income and an increase in the number of consumers
on equilibrium.
Suppose due to a hike in the salaries of the consumers, their incomes increase.
How would it affect equilibrium? With an increase in income, consumers are able
to spend more money on some goods. But recall from Chapter 2 that the consumers
will spend less on an inferior good with increase in income whereas for a normal
good, with prices of all commodities and tastes and preferences of the consumers
held constant, we would expect the demand for the good to increase at each price
as a result of which the market demand curve will shift rightward. Here we consider
the example of a normal good like clothes, the demand for which increases
with increase in income of consumers, thereby causing a rightward shift in the
demand curve. However, this income increase does not have any impact on
Shifts in Demand. Initially, the market equilibrium is at E. Due to the shift in demand to the
right, the new equilibrium is at G as shown in panel (a) and due to the leftward shift, the new
equilibrium is at F, as shown in panel (b). With rightward shift the equilibrium quantity and price
increase whereas with leftward shift, equilibrium quantity and price decrease.

Now, suppose due to some reason, the market supply curve shifts leftward to
SS2 with the demand curve remaining unchanged, as shown in panel (a). Because
of the shift, at the prevailing price, p0, there will be excess demand equal to
q'' qo in
the market. Some consumers who are unable to obtain the good will be willing to
pay higher prices and the market price tends to increase. The new equilibrium is
attained at point G where the supply curve SS2 intersects the demand curve DD0
such that q2 quantity will be bought and sold at price p2. Similarly, when supply
curve shifts rightward, as shown in panel (b), at p0 there will be supply excess of
Shifts in Supply. Initially, the market equilibrium is at E. Due to the shift in supply curve to the
left, the new equilibrium point is G as shown in panel (a) and due to the rightward shift the new
equilibrium point is F, as shown in panel (b). With rightward shift, the equilibrium quantity
increases and price decreases whereas with leftward shift,equilibrium quantity decreases and
price increases.
the supply curve, which shifts only due to some changes in the factors relating to
technology or cost of production of the firms. Thus, the supply curve remains
unchanged. In the Figure 5.2 (a), this is shown by a shift in the demand curve
from DD0 to DD2 but the supply curve remains unchanged at SS0. From the figure,
it is clear that at the new equilibrium, the price of clothes is higher and the quantity
demanded and sold is also higher.
Now let us turn to another example. Suppose due to some reason, there is
increase in the number of consumers in the market for clothes. As the number
of consumers increases, other factors remaining unchanged, at each price, more
clothes will be demanded. Thus, the demand curve will shift rightwards. But
this increase in the number of consumers does not have any impact on the
supply curve since the supply curve may shift only due to changes in the
parameters relating to firms’ behaviour or with an increase in the number of
firms, as stated in Chapter 4. This case again can be illustrated through Figure
5.2(a) in which the demand curve DD0 shifts rightward to DD2, the supply curve
remaining unchanged at SS0. The figure clearly shows that compared to the old
equilibrium point E, at point G which is the new equilibrium point, there is an
increase in both price and quantity demanded and supplied.
Supply Shift
In Figure 5.3, we show the impact of a shift in supply curve on the equilibrium
price and quantity. Suppose, initially, the market is in equilibrium at point E
where the market demand curve DD0 intersects the market supply curve SS0
such that the equilibrium price is p0 and the equilibrium quantity is q0.

goods  equal to q0
q ' . In response to this excess supply, some firms will reduce
their price and the new equilibrium will be attained at F where the supply curve
SS1 intersects the demand curve DD0 such that the new market price is p1 at
which q1 quantity is bought and sold. Notice the directions of change in price and
quantity are opposite whenever there is a shift in supply curve.
Now with this understanding, we can analyse the behaviour of equilibrium
price and quantity when various aspects of the market change. Here, we will
consider the effect of an increase in input price and an increase in number of
firms on equilibrium.
Let us consider a situation where all other things remaining constant, there
is an increase in the price of an input used in the production of a commodity.
This will increase the marginal cost of production of the firms using this input.
Therefore, at each price, the market supply will be less than before. Hence, the
supply curve shifts leftward. In the Figure 5.3(a), this is shown by a shift in the
supply curve from SS0 to SS2. But this increase in input price has no impact on
the demand of the consumers since it does not depend on the input prices
directly. Therefore, the demand curve remains unchanged. In Figure 5.3(a), this
is shown by the demand curve remaining unchanged at DD0. As a result,
compared to the old equilibrium, now the market price rises and quantity
produced decreases.
Let us discuss the impact of an increase in the number of firms. Since at
each price now more firms will supply the commodity, the supply curve shifts to
the right but it does not have any effect on the demand curve. This example can
be illustrated by Figure 5.3(b) where the supply curve shifts from SS0 to SS1
whereas the demand curve remains unchanged at DD0. From the figure, we can
say that there will be a decrease in price of the commodity and increase in the
quantity produced compared to the initial situation.
Simultaneous Shifts of Demand and Supply
What happens when both demand and supply curves shift simultaneously?
The simultaneous shifts can happen in four possible ways:
(i) Both supply and demand curves shift rightwards.
(ii) Both supply and demand curves shift leftwards.
(iii) Supply curve shifts leftward and demand curve shifts rightward.
(iv) Supply curve shifts rightward and demand curve shifts leftward.
The impact on equilibrium price and quantity in all the four cases are
given in Table 5.1. Each row of the table describes the direction in which the
equilibrium price and quantity will change for each possible combination of
the simultaneous shifts in demand and supply curves. For instance, from the
second row of the table, we see that due to a rightward shift in both demand
and supply curves, the equilibrium quantity increases invariably but the
equilibrium price may either increase, decrease or remain unchanged. The
actual direction in which the price will change will depend on the
magnitude of the shifts. Check this yourself by varying the magnitude
of shifts for this particular case.
In the first two cases which are shown in the first two rows of the table, the
impact on equilibrium quantity is unambiguous but the equilibrium price may
change, if at all, in either direction depending on the magnitudes of shifts. In the
next two cases, shown in the last two rows of the table, the effect on price is
unambiguous whereas effect on quantity depends on the magnitude of shifts in
the two curves.

Simultaneous Shifts in Demand and Supply. Initially, the equilibrium is at E where
the demand curve DD0 and supply curve SS0 intersect. In panel (a), both the supply and
the demand curves shift rightwards leaving price unchanged but quantity getting increased.
In panel (b), the supply curve shifts rightward and demand curve shifts leftward leaving
quantity unchanged but price decreased.
In the Figure 5.4(a), it can be seen that due to rightward shifts in both demand
and supply curves, the equilibrium quantity increases whereas the equilibrium
price remains unchanged, and in Figure 5.4(b), equilibrium quantity remains
the same whereas price decreases due to a leftward shift in demand curve and a
rightward shift in supply curve.
5.1.2 Market Equilibrium: Free Entry and Exit
In the last section, the market equilibrium was studied under the assumption
that there is a fixed number of firms. In this section, we will study market
equilibrium when firms can enter and exit the market freely. Here, for simplicity,
we assume that all the firms in the market are identical.
What is the implication of the entry and exit assumption? This assumption
implies that in equilibrium no firm earns supernormal profit or incurs loss by
remaining in production; in other words, the equilibrium price will be equal to
the minimum average cost of the firms.

Market Equilibrium
To see why it is so, suppose, at the
prevailing market price, each firm is
earning supernormal profit. The
possibility of earning supernormal profit
will attract some new firms which will
lead to a reduction in the supernormal
profit and eventually supernormal profit will be
wiped out when there is a sufficient number of
firms. At this point, with all firms in the market
earning normal profit, no more firms will have
incentive to enter. Similarly, if the firms are
earning less than normal profit at the prevailing
price, some firms will exit which will lead to an
increase in profit, and with sufficient number of
firms, the profits of each firm will increase to
the level of normal profit. At this point, no more
firm will want to leave since they will be earning
normal profit here. Thus, with free entry and
exit, each firm will always earn normal profit at
the prevailing market price.
Recall from the previous chapter that the firms will earn supernormal profit
so long as the price is greater than the minimum average cost and at prices less
than minimum average cost, they will earn less than normal profit. Therefore, at
prices greater than the minimum average cost, new firms will enter, and at prices
below minimum average cost, existing firms will start exiting. At the price level
equal to the minimum average cost of the firms, each firm will earn normal profit
so that no new firm will be attracted to enter the market. Also the existing firms
will not leave the market since they are not incurring any loss by producing at
this point. So, this price will prevail in the market.
Therefore, free entry and exit of the firms imply that the market price will
always be equal to the minimum average cost, that is
p = min AC
From the above, it follows
that the equilibrium price will be
equal to the minimum average
cost of the firms. In equilibrium,
the quantity supplied will be
determined by the market
demand at that price so that they
are equal. Graphically, this is
shown in Figure 5.5 where the
market will be in equilibrium at
point E at which the demand
curve DD intersects the p0 = min
AC line such that the market
price is p0 and the total quantity
demanded and supplied is
equal to q0.
At p0 = min AC each firm
supplies same amount of output,
say q0f . Therefore, the equilibrium

number of firms in the market is equal to the number of firms required to supply
q0 output at p0, each in turn supplying q0f amount at that price. If we denote the
equilibrium number of firms by n0, then
To understand the equilibrium price and quantity determination more
clearly, let us look at the following example.
EXAMPLE
Consider the example of a market for wheat such that the demand curve for
wheat is given as follows
qD = 200 – p
for 0 ≤ p ≤ 200
for p > 200
Assume that the market consists of identical farms. The supply curve of a
single farm is given by
= 10 + p
for p ≥ 20
for 0 ≤ p < 20
The free entry and exit of farms would mean that the farms will never produce
below minimum average cost because otherwise they will incur loss from
production in which case they will exit the market.
As we know, with free entry and exit, the market will be in equilibrium at a
price which equals the minimum average cost of the farms. Therefore, the
equilibrium price is
p0 = 20
At this price, market will supply that quantity which is equal to the market
demand. Therefore, from the demand curve, we get the equilibrium quantity:
q0 = 200 – 20 = 180
Also at p0 = 20, each farm supplies
q0f = 10 + 20 = 30
Therefore, the equilibrium number of farms is
= 180
30  = 6
Thus, with free entry and exit, the equilibrium price, quantity and number of
farms are Rs 20, 180 kg and 6 respectively.
Shifts in Demand
Let us examine the impact of shift in demand on equilibrium price and quantity
when the firms can freely enter and exit the market. From the previous section,
we know that free entry and exit of the firms would imply that under all
circumstances equilibrium price will be equal to the minimum average cost of
the existing firms. Under this condition, even if the market demand curve shifts
in either direction, at the new equilibrium, the market will supply the desired
quantity at the same price.
In Figure 5.6, DD0 is the market demand curve which tells us how much
quantity will be demanded by the consumers at different prices and p0 denotes

the price which is equal to the minimum average cost of the firms. The initial
equilibrium is at point E where the demand curve DD0 cuts the p0 = minAC line
and the total quantity demanded and supplied is q0. The equilibrium number of
firms is n0 in this situation.
Now suppose the demand curve shifts to the right for some reason. At p0
there will be excess demand for the commodity. Some dissatisfied consumers
will be willing to pay higher price for the commodity, so the price tends to
rise. This gives rise to a possibility of earning supernormal profit which will
attract new firms to the market. The entry of these new firms will eventually
wipe out the supernormal profit and the price will again reach p0. Now higher
quantity will be supplied at the same price. From the panel (a), we can see
that the new demand curve DD1 intersects the p0 = minAC line at point F such
that the new equilibrium will be (p0, q1) where q1 is greater than q0. The new
equilibrium number of firms n1 is greater than n0 because of the entry of new
firms. Similarly, for a leftward shift of the demand curve to DD2, there will be
Shifts in Demand. Initially, the demand curve was DD0, the equilibrium quantity and price
were q0 and p0 respectively. With rightward shift of the demand curve to DD1, as shown in
panel (a), the equilibrium quantity increases and with leftward shift of the demand curve to
DD2, as shown in panel (b), the equilibrium quantity decreases. In both the cases, the equilibrium
price remains unchanged at p0.
excess supply at the price p0. In response to this excess supply, some firms,
which will be unable to sell their desired quantity at p0, will wish to lower
their price. The price tends to decrease which will lead to the exit of some of
the existing firms and the price will again reach p0. Therefore, in the new
equilibrium, less quantity will be supplied which will be equal to the reduced
demand at that price. This is shown in panel (b) where due to the shift of
demand curve from DD0 to DD2, quantity demanded and supplied will
decrease to q2 whereas the price will remain unchanged at p0. Here, the
equilibrium number of firms, n2 is less than n0 due to the exit of some existing
firms. Thus, due to a shift in demand rightwards (leftwards), the equilibrium
quantity and number of firms will increase (decrease) whereas the
equilibrium price will remain unchanged.
Here, we should note that with free entry and exit, shift in demand has a
larger effect on quantity than it does with the fixed number of firms. But
unlike with fixed number of firms, here, we do not have any effect on
equilibrium price at all.

5.2 APPLICATIONS
In this section, we try to understand how the supply-demand analysis can be
applied. In particular, we look at two examples of government intervention in
the form of price control. Often, it becomes necessary for the government to
regulate the prices of certain goods and services when their prices are either too
high or too low in comparison to the
desired levels. We will analyse these
issues within the framework of perfect
competition to look at what impact
these regulations have on the market for
these goods.
5.2.1 Price Ceiling
It is not very uncommon to come across
instances where government fixes a
maximum allowable price for certain
goods. The government-imposed upper
limit on the price of a good or service is
called price ceiling. Price ceiling is
generally imposed on necessary items
like wheat, rice, kerosene, sugar and it
is fixed below the market-determined
price since at the market-determined
price some section of the population
will not be able to afford these goods.
Let us examine the effects of price ceiling on market equilibrium through the
example of market for wheat.
Figure 5.7 shows the market
supply curve SS and the market
demand curve DD for wheat.
The equilibrium price and
quantity of wheat are p* and
q* respectively. When the
government imposes price ceiling
at pc which is lower than the
equilibrium price level, the
consumers demand qc kilograms
of wheat whereas the firms supply
q '  kilograms. Therefore, there will
be an excess demand for wheat in
the market at that price.
Hence, though the intention of
the government was to help the
consumers, it would end up
creating shortage of wheat.
Therefore, to ensure availability of wheat to everyone, ration coupons are issued
to the consumers so that no individual can buy more than a certain amount of
wheat and this stipulated amount of wheat is sold through ration shops which
are also called fair price shops.
Effect of Price Ceiling in Wheat Market. The
equilibrium price and quantity are p* and q*
respectively. Imposition of price ceiling at pc gives
rise to excess demand in the wheat market.

Summary
Summary
Summary
Summary
Summary
In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium occurs where market demand
equals market supply.
The equilibrium price and quantity are determined at the intersection of the
market demand and market supply curves when there is fixed number of firms.
Each firm employs labour upto the point where the marginal revenue product
of labour equals the wage rate.
With supply curve remaining unchanged when demand curve shifts
rightward (leftward), the equilibrium quantity increases (decreases) and
equilibrium price increases (decreases) with fixed number of firms.
In general, price ceiling accompanied by rationing of the goods may have the
following adverse consequences on the consumers: (a) Each consumer has to
stand in long queues to buy the good from ration shops. (b) Since all consumers
will not be satisfied by the quantity of the goods that they get from the fair price
shop, some of them will be willing to pay higher price for it. This may result in
the creation of black market.
5.2.2 Price Floor
For certain goods and services, fall
in price below a particular level is
not desirable and hence the
government sets floors or
minimum prices for these goods
and services. The government-
imposed lower limit on the price
that may be charged for a
particular good or service is called
price floor. Most well-known
examples of imposition of price
floor are agricultural price
support programmes and the
minimum wage legislation.
Through an agricultural
price support programme, the
government imposes a lower limit
on the purchase price for some of
the agricultural goods and the floor is normally set at a level higher than the
market-determined price for these goods. Similarly, through the minimum wage
legislation, the government ensures that the wage rate of the labourers does not
fall below a particular level and here again the minimum wage rate is set above
the equilibrium wage rate.
Figure 5.8 shows the market supply and the market demand curve for a
commodity on which price floor is imposed. The market equilibrium here would
occur at price p* and quantity q*. But when the government imposes a floor higher
than the equilibrium price at pf , the market demand is qf whereas the firms want
to supply q′f, thereby leading to an excess supply in the market equal to qf q′f .
In the case of agricultural support, to prevent price from falling because of
excess supply, government needs to buy the surplus at the predetermined price.

With demand curve remaining unchanged when supply curve shifts
rightward (leftward), the equilibrium quantity increases (decreases) and
equilibrium price decreases (increases) with fixed number of firms.
When both demand and supply curves shift in the same direction, the effect
on equilibrium quantity can be unambiguously determined whereas the
effect on equilibrium price depends on the magnitude of the shifts.
When demand and supply curves shift in opposite directions, the effect on
equilibrium price can be unambiguously determined whereas the effect on
equilibrium quantity depends on the magnitude of the shifts.
In a perfectly competitive market with identical firms if the firms can enter
and exit the market freely, the equilibrium price is always equal to minimum
average cost of the firms.
With free entry and exit, the shift in demand has no impact on equilibrium
price but changes the equilibrium quantity and number of firms in the same
direction as the change in demand.
In comparison to a market with fixed number of firms, the impact of a shift
in demand curve on equilibrium quantity is more pronounced in a market
with free entry and exit.
Imposition of price ceiling below the equilibrium price leads to an excess demand.

Non-competitive Markets
We recall that perfect competition was theorised as a market
structure where both consumers and firms were price takers.
The behaviour of the firm in such circumstances was described
in the Chapter 4. We discussed that the perfect competition
market structure is approximated by a market satisfying the
following conditions:
(i) there exist a very large number of firms and consumers of the
commodity, such that the output sold by each firm is negligibly
small compared to the total output of all the firms combined,
and similarly, the amount purchased by each consumer is
extremely small in comparison to the quantity purchased by
all consumers together;
(ii) firms are free to start producing the commodity or to stop
production;
(iii) the output produced by each firm in the industry is
indistinguishable from the others and the output of any other
industry cannot substitute this output; and
(iv) consumers and firms have perfect knowledge of the output,
inputs and their prices.
In this chapter, we shall discuss situations where one or more
of these conditions are not satisfied. If assumptions (i) and (ii) are
dropped, we get market structures called monopoly and oligopoly.
If assumption (iii) is dropped, we obtain a market structure called
monopolistic competition. Dropping of assumption (iv) is dealt with
as ‘economics of risk’. This chapter will examine the market
structures of monopoly, monopolistic competition and oligopoly.
6.1 SIMPLE MONOPOLY IN THE COMMODITY MARKET
A market structure in which there is a single seller
is called monopoly. The conditions hidden in
this single line definition, however, need to be
explicitly stated. A monopoly market
structure requires that there is a
single producer of a particular
commodity; no other commodity
works as a substitute for
this commodity; and for this
situation to persist over
time, sufficient restrictions
‘I’ ‘M’ Perfect Competition

In order to examine the difference in the equilibrium resulting from a monopoly
in the commodity market as compared to other market structures, we also need
to assume that all other markets remain perfectly competitive. In particular, we
need (i) that the market of the particular commodity is perfectly competitive
from the demand side ie all the consumers are price takers; and (ii) that the
markets of the inputs used in the production of this commodity are perfectly
competitive both from the supply and demand side.
If all the above conditions are satisfied, then we define the situation as one of
monopoly in a single commodity market.
6.1.1 Market Demand Curve is the Average Revenue Curve
The market demand curve in
Figure 6.1 shows the quantities
that consumers as a whole are
willing to purchase at different
prices. If the market price is at the
higher level p0, consumers are
willing to purchase the lesser
quantity q0. On the other hand, if
the market price is at the lower
level p1, consumers are willing to
buy a higher quantity q1. That is,
price in the market affects the
quantity demanded by the
consumers. This is also expressed
by saying that the quantity
purchased by the consumers is a
decreasing function of the price.
Competitive Behaviour versus Competitive Structure
A perfectly competitive market has been defined as one where an individual
firm is unable to influence the price at which the product is sold in the
market. Since price remains the same for any level of output of the individual
firm, such a firm is able to sell any quantity that it wishes to sell at the given
market price. It, therefore, does not need to compete with other firms to
obtain a market for its produce.
This is clearly the opposite of the meaning of what is commonly
understood by competition or competitive behaviour. We see that Coke and
Pepsi compete with each other in a variety of ways to achieve a higher level
of sales or a greater share of the market. Conversely, we do not find individual
farmers competing among themselves to sell a larger amount of crop. This
is because both Coke and Pepsi possess the power to influence the market
price of soft drinks, while the individual farmer does not.
Thus, competitive behaviour and competitive market structure are, in
general, inversely related; the more competitive the market structure, less
competitive is the behaviour of the firms. On the other hand, the less
competitive the market structure, the more competitive is the behaviour of
firms towards each other. Pure monopoly is the most visible exception.

are required to be in place to prevent any other firm from entering the market
and to start selling the commodity.

Introductory Microeconomics
For the monopoly firm, the above argument expresses itself from the reverse
direction. The monopoly firm’s decision to sell a larger quantity is possible only
at a lower price. Conversely, if the monopoly firm brings a smaller quantity of
the commodity into the market for sale it will be able to sell at a higher price.
Thus, for the monopoly firm, the price depends on the quantity of the commodity
sold. The same is also expressed by stating that price is a decreasing function of
the quantity sold. Thus, for the monopoly firm, the market demand curve
expresses the price that is available for different quantities supplied. This idea is
reflected in the statement that the monopoly firm faces the market demand curve.
The above idea can be viewed from another angle. Since the firm is assumed
to have perfect knowledge of the market demand curve, the monopoly firm can
decide the price at which it wishes to sell its commodity, and therefore, determines
the quantity to be sold. For instance, examining Figure 6.1 again, since the
monopoly firm is aware of the shape of the curve DD, if it wishes to sell the
commodity at the price p0, it can do so by producing and selling quantity q0,
since at the price p0, consumers are willing to purchase the quantity q0. This
idea is concretised in the slogan: ‘Monopoly firm is a price maker’.
The contrast with the firm in a perfectly competitive market structure should
be clear. In that case, the firm could bring into the market as much quantity of
the commodity as it wished and could sell it at the same price. Since this does
not happen for a monopoly firm, the amount of money received by the firm
through the sale of the commodity has to be examined again.
We do this exercise through a schedule, a graph, and using a simple equation
of a straight line demand curve. As an example, let the demand function be
given by the equation
q = 20 – 2p,
where q is the quantity sold and p is the price in rupees.
The equation can be written in terms of p as
p = 10 – 0.5q
Substituting different values of q from 0 to 13 gives us the prices from 10
to 3.5. These are shown in the q and p
columns of Table 6.1.
These numbers are depicted in a graph in
Figure 6.2 with prices on the vertical axis and
quantities on the horizontal axis. The prices
that are available for different quantities of the
commodity are shown by the solid straight
line D.
The total revenue (TR) received by the firm
from the sale of the commodity equals the
product of the price and the quantity sold. In
the case of the monopoly firm, the total revenue
is not a straight line. Its shape depends on the
shape of the demand curve. Mathematically,
TR is represented as a function of the quantity
sold. Hence, in our example
TR = p × q
= (10 – 0.5q) × q
= 10q – 0.5q2

This is not the equation of a
straight line. It is a quadratic
equation in which the squared
term has a negative cofficient.
Such an equation represents an
inverted vertical parabola.
In Table 6.1, the TR column
represents the product of the p
and q columns. It can be noticed
that as the quantity increases, TR
increases to Rs 50 when output
becomes 10 units, and after this
level of output, total revenue
starts declining. The same is
visible in Figure 6.2.
The revenue received by the
firm per unit of commodity sold
is called the Average Revenue (AR). Mathematically, AR = TR/q. In Table 6.1, the
AR column provides values obtained by dividing TR values by q values. It can
be seen that the AR values turn out to be the same as the values in the p column.
This is only to be expected
AR = TR
Since TR = p × q, substituting this into the AR equation
AR = (
As seen earlier, the p values represent the market demand curve as shown
in Figure 6.2. The AR curve will therefore lie exactly on the market demand
curve. This is expressed by the statement that the market demand curve is
the average revenue curve for the
monopoly firm.
Graphically, the value of AR
can be found from the TR curve
for any level of quantity sold
through a simple construction
given in Figure 6.3. When quantity
is of 6 units, draw a vertical line
passing through the value 6 on
the horizontal axis. This line will
cut the TR curve at the point
marked ‘a’ at a height equal to 42.
Draw a straight line joining the
origin O and point ‘a’. The slope
of this ray from the origin to a
point on the TR provides the value
of AR. The slope of this ray is equal
to 7. Therefore, AR has the value
7. The same can be verified from
Table 6.1.
Relation between Average Revenue and
Total Revenue Curves. The average revenue
at any level of output is given by the slope of the
line joining the origin and the point on the total

under consideration.

6.1.2 Total, Average and Marginal Revenues
A more careful glance at Table 6.1 reveals that TR does not increase by the
same amount for every unit increase in quantity. Sale of the first unit leads to
a change in TR from Rs 0 when quantity is of 0 unit to Rs 9.50 when quantity
is 1 unit, i.e., a rise of Rs 9.50. As the quantity increases further, the rise in TR
is smaller. For example, for the 5th unit of the commodity, the rise in TR is
Rs 5.50 (Rs 37.50 for 5 units minus Rs 32 for 4 units). As mentioned earlier,
after 10 units of output, TR starts declining. This implies that bringing more
than 10 units for sale leads to a level of TR less than Rs 50. Thus, the rise in TR
due to the 12th unit is: 48 – 49.50 = –1.5, ie a fall of Rs 1.50.
This change in TR due to the sale of an additional unit is termed Marginal
Revenue (MR). In Table 6.1, this is depicted in the last column. The values in
every row of the MR column after the first equal the TR value in that row minus
the TR value in the previous row. In the last paragraph, it was shown that TR
increases more slowly as quantity sold increases and falls after quantity reaches
10 units. The same can be viewed through the MR values which fall as q
increases. After the quantity reaches 10 units, MR has negative values. In Figure
6.2, MR is depicted by the dotted line.
Graphically, the values of
the MR curve are given by the
slope of the TR curve. The slope
of any smooth curve is defined
as the slope of the tangent to the
curve at that point. This is
depicted in Figure 6.4. At point
‘a’ on the TR curve, the value of
MR is given by the slope of the
line L1, and at point ‘b’ by the
line L2. It can be seen that both
lines have positive slope, but the
line L2 is flatter than line L1, ie
its slope is lesser. The value of
MR for the same level of quantity
is also lesser. When 10 units of
the commodity are sold, the
tangent to the TR is horizontal,
ie its slope is zero. The value of
the MR for the same quantity is zero. At point ‘d’ on the TR curve, where the
tangent is negatively sloped, the MR takes a negative value.
We can now conclude that when total revenue is rising, marginal revenue
is positive, and when total revenue shows a fall, marginal revenue is negative.
Another relation can be seen between the AR and the MR curves. Figure
6.2 shows that the MR curve lies below the AR curve. The same can be seen in
Table 6.1 where the values of MR at any level of output are lower than the
corresponding values of AR. We can conclude that if the AR curve (ie the demand
curve) is falling steeply, the MR curve is far below the AR curve. On the other
hand, if the AR curve is less steep, the vertical distance between the AR and
MR curves is smaller. Figure 6.5(a) shows a flatter AR curve while Figure 6.5(b)
shows a steeper AR curve. For the same units of the commodity, the difference
between AR and MR in panel (a) is smaller than the difference in panel (b).

Relation between Average Revenue and Marginal Revenue curves. If the AR curve is
steeper, then the MR curve is far below the AR curve.
6.1.3 Marginal Revenue and Price Elasticity of Demand
The MR values also have a relation with the price elasticity of demand. The detailed
relation is not derived here. It is sufficient to notice only one aspect– price
elasticity of demand is more than 1 when the MR has a positive value, and becomes
less than the unity when MR has a negative value. This can be seen in Table 6.2,
which uses the same data presented in Table 6.1. As the quantity of the commodity
increases, MR value becomes smaller and the value of the price elasticity of demand
also becomes smaller. Recall that the demand curve is called elastic at a point
where price elasticity is greater than unity, inelastic at a point where the
price elasticity is less than unity and unitary elastic when price elasticity is equal
to 1. Table 6.2 shows that when quantity is less than 10 units, MR is positive and
the demand curve is elastic and when quantity is of more than 10 units, the
demand curve is inelastic. At the quantity level of 10 units, the demand curve is
unitary elastic.
6.1.4 Short Run Equilibrium of the
Monopoly Firm
As in the case of perfect competition, we
continue to regard the monopoly firm as
one which maximises profit. In this section,
we analyse this profit maximising
behaviour to determine the quantity
produced by a monopoly firm and price at
which it is sold. We shall assume that a firm
does not maintain stocks of the quantity
produced and that the entire quantity
produced is put up for sale.
The Simple Case of Zero Cost
Suppose there exists a village situated
sufficiently far away from other villages. In
this village, there is exactly one well from
which water is available. All residents are
completely dependent for their water

requirements on this well. The well is owned by one person who is able to prevent
others from drawing water from it except through purchase of water. The person
who purchases the water has to draw the water out of the well. The well owner is
thus a monopolist firm which bears zero cost in producing the good.
We shall analyse this simple case of a monopolist bearing zero costs to determine
the amount of water sold and the price at which it is sold.
Figure 6.6 depicts the same
TR, AR and MR curves, as in
Figure 6.2. The profit received by
the firm equals the revenue
received by the firm minus the cost
incurred, that is, Profit = TR – TC.
Since in this case TC is zero, profit
is maximum when TR is
maximum. This, as we have seen
earlier, occurs when output is of
10 units. This is also the level
when MR equals zero. The
amount of profit is given by the
length of the vertical line segment
from ‘a’ to the horizontal axis.
The price at which this output
will be sold is the price that the
consumers as a whole are willing
to pay. This is given by the market demand curve D. At output level of 10
units, the price is Rs 5. Since the market demand curve is the AR curve for the
monopolist firm, Rs 5 is the average revenue received by the firm. The total
revenue is given by the product of AR and the quantity sold, ie Rs 5 × 10 units
= Rs 50. This is depicted by the area of the shaded rectangle.
Comparison with Perfect Competition
We compare the above outcome with what it would be under perfectly competitive
market structure. Let us assume that there is an infinite number of such wells.
If one well owner charges Rs 5 per unit of water to get a profit of Rs 50, another
well owner realising there are still consumers willing to buy water at a lower
rate, will fix the price lower than Rs 5, say at Rs 4. Consumers will decide to
purchase from the second water seller and demand a larger quantity of 12 units
creating a total revenue of Rs 48. In similar fashion, another water seller, in
order to obtain the revenue, would offer a still lower price, say Rs 3, and selling
14 units earning a revenue of Rs 42. Since there is an infinite number of firms,
price would continue to move down infinitely till it reaches zero. At this output,
20 units of water would be sold and profit would become zero.
Through this comparison, we can see that a perfectly competitive equilibrium
results in a larger quantity being sold at a lower price. We can now proceed to
the general case involving positive costs of production.
Introducing Positive Costs
Analysing using Total curves
In Chapter 3, we have discussed the concept of cost and the shape of the total
cost curve having been depicted as shown by TC in Figure 6.7. The TR curve is
also drawn in the same diagram. The profit received by the firm equals the total
revenue minus the total cost. In the figure, we can see that if quantity q1 is
Short Run Equilibrium of the Monopolist with
Zero Costs. The monopolist’s profit is maximised
at that level of output for which the total revenue is
the maximum.

Non-competitive Markets
produced, the total revenue is TR1 and total cost is TC1. The difference, TR1 – TC1,
is the profit received. The same is depicted by the length of the line segment AB,
i.e., the vertical distance between the TR and TC curves at q1 level of output. It
should be clear that this vertical distance changes for diferent levels of output.
When output level is less than q2, the TC curve lies above the TR curve, i.e., TC is
greater than TR, and therefore profit is negative and the firm makes losses.
The same situation exists for
output levels greater than q3.
Hence, the firm can make positive
profits only at output levels
between q2 and q3, where TR curve
lies above the TC curve. The
monopoly firm will choose that
level of output which maximises
its profit. This would be the level
of output for which the vertical
distance between the TR and TC
is maximum and TR is above the
TC, i.e., TR – TC is maximum. This
occurs at the level of output q0.
If the difference TR – TC is
calculated and drawn as a graph,
it will look as in the curve marked
‘Profit’ in Figure 6.7. It should be
noticed that the Profit curve has
its maximum value at the level of
output q0.
The price at which this output is sold is the price consumers are willing to pay
for this q0 quantity of the commodity. So the monopoly firm will charge the price
corresponding to the quantity level q0 on the demand curve.
Using Average and Marginal curves
The analysis shown above can also be conducted using Average and Marginal
Revenue and Average and Marginal Cost. Though a bit more complex, this
method is able to exhibit the process in greater light.
In Figure 6.8, the Average
Cost (AC), Average Variable Cost
(AVC) and Marginal Cost (MC)
curves are drawn along with the
Demand (Average Revenue) Curve
and Marginal Revenue crve.
It may be seen that at quantity
level below q0, the level of MR is
higher than the level of MC. This
means that the increase in total
revenue from selling an extra unit
of the commodity is greater than
the increase in total cost for
producing the additional unit. This
implies that an additional unit of
output would create additional
profits since Change in profit =
Change in TR – Change in TC.

at the level of output for which the vertical distance
between the TR and TC is a maximum and TR is

Therefore, if the firm is producing a level of output less than q0, it would desire to
increase its output since that would add to its profits. As long as the MR curve lies
above the MC curve, the reasoning provided above would apply and thus the firm
would increase its output. This process comes to a halt when the firm reaches an
output level of q0 since at this level MR equals MC and increasing output provides
no increase in profits.
On the other hand, if the firm was producing a level of output which is greater
than q0, MC is greater than MR. This means that the lowering of total cost by
reducing one unit of output is greater than the loss in total revenue due to this
reduction. It is therefore advisable for the firm to reduce output. This argument
would hold good as long as the MC curve lies above the MR curve, and the firm
would keep reducing its output. Once output level reaches q0, the values of MC
and MR become equal and the firm stops reducing its output.
Since the firm inevitably reaches the output level q0, this level is called the
equilibrium level of output. Since this equilibrium level of output corresponds
to the point where the MR equals MC, this equality is called the equilibrium
condition for the output produced by a monopoly firm.
At this equilibrium level of output q0, the average cost is given by the point
‘d’ where the vertical line from q0 cuts the AC curve. The average cost is thus
given by the height dq0. Since total cost equals the product of AC and the quantity
produced being q0, the same is given by the area of the rectangle Oq0dc.
As shown earlier, once the quantity of output produced is determined, the
price at which it is sold is given by the amount that the consumers are willing to
pay, as expressed through the market demand curve. Thus, the price is given
by the point ‘a’ where the vertical line through q0 meets the market demand
curve D. This provides price given by the height aq0. Since the price received by
the firm is the revenue per unit of output, it is the Average Revenue for the firm.
The total revenue being the product of AR and the level of output q0, can be
shown as the area of the rectangle Oq0ab.
It can be seen from the diagram that the area of the rectangle Oq0ab is larger
than the area of the rectangle Oq0dc, i.e., TR is greater than TC. The difference is
the area of the rectangle cdab. Thus, Profit = TR – TC which can be represented
by this area cdab.
Comparison with Perfect Competition again
We compare the monopoly firm’s equilibrium quantity and price with that of
the perfectly competitive firm. Recall that the perfectly competitive firm was a
price taker. Given the market price, the firm in a perfectly competitive market
structure believed that it could not alter the price by producing more of the
output or less of it.
Suppose that the firm, whose equilibrium we were considering above, believed
that it was a perfectly competitive firm. Then, given its level of output at q0, price
of the commodity at aq0 = Ob, it would expect the price to remain fixed at Ob,
and therefore, every additional unit of output could be sold at that price. Since
the cost of producing an additional unit, given by the MC, stands at eq0 which is
less than aq0, the firm would expect a gain in profit by increasing the output.
This would continue as long as the price remained higher than the MC. At the
point ‘f ’ in Figure 6.8, where the MC curve cuts the demand curve, price received
by the firm becomes equal to the MC. Hence, it would no longer be considered
beneficial by this perfectly competitive firm to increase output. It is for this reason
that Price = Marginal Cost that is considered the equilibrium condition for the
perfectly competitive firm.

Non-competitive Markets
The diagram shows that at this level of output, the quantity produced qc is
greater than q0. Also, the price paid by the consumers is lower at pc. From this we
conclude that the perfectly competitive market provides a production and sale of
a larger quantity of the commodity compared to a monopoly firm. Further the
price of the commodity under perfect competition is lower compared to monopoly.
The profit earned by the perfectly competitive firm is also smaller.
In the Long Run
We saw in Chapter 5 that with free entry and exit, perfectly competitive firms
obtain zero profits. That was due to the fact that if profits earned by firms were
positive, more firms would enter the market and the increase in output would
bring the price down, thereby decreasing the earnings of the existing firms.
Similarly, if firms were facing losses, some firms would close down and the
reduction in output would raise prices and increase the earnings of the remaining
firms. The same is not the case with monopoly firms. Since other firms are
prevented from entering the market, the profits earned by monopoly firms do
not go away in the long run.
Some Critical Views
The results presented above portray an extremely negative picture of the impact
of monopoly in a commodity market: the monopoly firms solely benefit
themselves, at the cost of consumers. The monopoly firm receives a higher
profit and a positive profit even in the long run. On the other hand, consumers
get a lesser quantity of the output and have to pay more for each unit consumed.
However, varying views have been expressed by economists concerning the
question of monopoly. First, it can be argued that monopoly of the kind described
above cannot exist in the real world. This is because all commodities are, in a
sense, substitutes for each other. This in turn is because of the fact that all the
firms producing commodities, in the final analysis, compete to obtain the income
in the hands of consumers.
Another argument is that even a firm in a pure monopoly situation is never
without competition. This is because the economy is never stationary. New
commodities using new technologies are always coming up, which are close
substitutes for the commodity produced by the monopoly firm. Hence, the
monopoly firm always has competition in the long run. Even in the short run,
the threat of competition is always present and the monopoly firm is unable to
behave in the manner we have described above.
Still another view argues that the existence of monopolies may be beneficial
to society. Since monopoly firms earn large profits, they possess sufficient funds
to take up research and development work, something which the small perfectly
competitive firm is unable to do. By doing such research, monopoly firms are
able to produce better quality goods. Also, because of the more modern
technologies which such firms are able to use, their marginal cost may be so
much lower that the equilibrium level of output, where MC = MR, may be even
larger than that in the case of perfect competition.
6.2 OTHER NON-PERFECTLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS
6.2.1 Monopolistic Competition
We now consider a market structure where the number of firms is large, there is
free entry and exit of firms, but the goods produced by them are not
homogeneous. Such a market structure is called monopolistic competition.

Introductory Microeconomics
This kind of a structure is more commonly visible. There is a very large
number of biscuit producing firms, for example. But many of the biscuits being
produced are associated with some brand name and are distinguishable from
one another by these brand names and packaging and are slightly different in
taste. The consumer develops a taste for a particular brand of biscuit over time,
or becomes loyal to a particular brand for some reason, and is, therefore, not
immediately willing to substitute it for another biscuit. However, if the price
difference becomes large, the consumer would be willing to choose a biscuit of
another brand. The price difference required for the consumer to change the
brand consumed may vary. Therefore, if price of a particular brand is lowered,
some consumers will shift to consuming that brand. Further, lowering of the
price will lead to more consumers shifting to the brand with the lower price.
Hence, the demand curve faced by the firm is not horizontal (perfectly elastic)
as is the case with perfect competition. The demand curve faced by the firm is
not the market demand curve, as in the case with monopoly. In the case of
monopolistic competition, the firm expects small increases in demand if it lowers
the price. Hence, the marginal revenue is slightly less than the average revenue.
The firm increases its output whenever the marginal revenue is greater than the
marginal cost. But since the marginal revenue is lower than the price, the marginal
revenue becomes equal to the marginal cost at a lower level of output compared
to perfect competition.
For this reason, the monopolistic competitive firm produces lower output as
compared to the perfectly competitive firm. Given lower output, since consumers
as a whole are willing to pay more per unit, the price of the commodity becomes
higher than the price under perfect competition.
The situation described above is one that exists in the short run. But the
market structure of monopolistic competition allows for new firms to enter the
market. If the firms in the industry are receiving positive amounts of profit in
the short run, this will attract new firms to start producing the commodity
(entry into the market). As output of the commodity expands, prices in the
market will tend to fall till profits become zero and there is now no attraction
for new firms to enter. Conversely, if firms in the industry are facing losses in
the short run, some firms would stop producing (exit from the market) the
commodity and the fall in total quantity produced would lead to a higher price.
Entry or exit would halt once profits become zero and this would serve as the
long run equilibrium.
Since the demand of the output of each firm continues to increase with a
fall in the price of its brand, the long run equilibrium continues to be
associated with a lower level of total output and a higher price as compared
to perfect competition.
6.2.2 How do Firms behave in Oligopoly?
If the market of a particular commodity consists of more than one seller but
the number of sellers is few, the market structure is termed oligopoly. The
special case of oligopoly where there are exactly two sellers is termed duopoly.
In analysing this market structure, we assume that the product sold by the
two firms is homogeneous and there is no substitute for the product, produced
by any other firm.
Given that there are a few firms, the output decisions of any one firm would
necessarily affect the market price and therefore the amount sold by the other
firms as also their total revenues. It is, therefore, only to be expected that other
firms would react to protect their profits. This reaction would be through taking

Non-competitive Markets
fresh decisions about the quantity and price of their own output. There are
various ways in which this can be theorised. We briefly explain two of them.
Firstly duopoly firms may collude together and decide not to compete with
each other and maximise total profits of the two firms together. In such a case
the two firms would behave like a single monopoly firm that has two different
factories producing the commodity.
Secondly, take the case of a duopoly where each of the two firms decides
how much quantity to produce by maximising its own profit assuming that the
other firm would not change the quantity that it is supplying.
We can examine the impact using a simple example where both the duopolist
firms have zero cost. A similar situation in the case of monopoly was earlier
considered in The Simple Case of Zero Cost in section 6.1.4. Recall that in that
case we were able to show that given a straight line demand curve, the
maximum quantity demanded by the consumers was 20 units at zero price,
and this would have been the equilibrium in case of a perfectly competitive
market structure. Given a monopoly structure, the quantity supplied was 10
units at a price of Rs 5. It can be shown that whenever the demand curve is a
straight line and total cost is zero, the monopolist finds it most profitable to
supply half of the maximum demand of the good. Let us use the same example
to examine the outcome in case there were two duopoly firms, A and B behaving
in the manner described above.
Assume that Firm B supplies zero units of the good, then Firm A realizing
that maximum demand is 20 units, would decide to supply half of it, i.e. 10
units. Given that Firm A is supplying 10 units, Firm B would realize that out of
the maximum demand of 20 units, a demand of 10 units (i.e. 20 minus 10) still
exists and hence would supply half of it, i.e. 5 units. Since firm B has changed
its supply from zero to 5 units, Firm A would realize that the total demand is 15
units (i.e., 20 minus 5) and supply half to it, i.e., 7.5 units. In the fashion, the
two firms would keep making moves. It can be shown that these lead to an
equilibrium. Let us examine these steps:
Quantity Supplied
2  × 20 = 20
2 (20 – 1
2  × 20) = 20
2  – 20
2 (20 – 1
2 (20 – 1
2  × 20)) = 20
2  – 20
4  + 20
2 (20 – 1
2 (20 – 1
2 (20 – 1
2  × 20))) = 20
2  – 20
4  + 20
8  – 20
And so on.
Therefore both the firms would finally supply an output equal to
2  – 20
4  + 20
8  – 20
16  + 20
32  – 20
64  + 20
128  ... = 20
The total quantity supplied in the market equals the sum of the quantity
supplied by the two firms is
3  + 20
3  = 2 × 20

which is greater than the quantity supplied under a monopoly market structure
and less than the quantity supplied under a perfectly competitive structure.
Since price depends on the quantity supplied by the formula
p = 10 – 0.5q, for q = 40
3 , price is 10 – 20
3  = Rs 3.33. This is lower than the price
under monopoly and higher than under perfect competition.
Even in the case where there are positive costs, the mathematics only
becomes more complex, but the results are similar. That through a very large
number of moves and countermoves, the two firm reach an equilibrium
quantity of total output. The quantity produced by both firms together is more
than what a pure monopoly would have produced and lesser than that
produced if the market structure was perfectly competitive. The equilibrium
market price is naturally lower than in the case of pure monopoly and higher
than under perfect competition.
Thirdly, some economists argue that oligopoly market structure makes the
market price of the commodity rigid, i.e. the market price does not move freely
in response to changes in demand. The reason for this lies in the way in which
oligopoly firms react to a change in price initiated by any firm. If one firm feels
that a price increase would generate higher profits, and therefore increases the
price at which it sells its output, other firms do not follow. The price increase
would therefore lead to a huge fall in the quantity sold by the firm leading to a
fall in its revenue and profit. It is therefore not rational for any firm to increase
the price. On the other hand, a firm may estimate that it could earn a larger
revenue and profit by selling a larger quantity of output and therefore lowers
the price at which it sells the commodity. Other firms would perceive this action
as a threat and therefore follow the first firm and lower their price as well. The
increase in the total quantity sold due to the lowering of price is therefore shared
by all the firms, and the firm that had initially lowered the price is able to achieve
only a small increase in the quantity it sells. A relatively large lowering of price
by the first firm leads to a relatively small increase in the quantity sold. Thus,
this firm experiences an inelastic demand curve and its decision to lower price
leads to a lowering of its revenue and profit. Any firm therefore finds it irrational
to change the prevailing price, leading to prices that are more rigid compared to
perfect competition.
The market structure called monopoly exists where there is exactly one seller
in any market.
A commodity market has a monopoly structure, if there is one seller of the
commodity, the commodity has no substitute, and entry into the industry
by another firm is prevented.
The market price of the commodity depends on the amount supplied by the
monopoly firm. The market demand curve is the average revenue curve for
the monopoly firm.
The shape of the total revenue curve depends on the shape of the average
revenue curve. In the case of a negatively sloping straight line demand curve,
the total revenue curve is an inverted vertical parabola.
Average revenue for any quantity level can be measured by the slope of the
line from the origin to the relevant point on the total revenue curve.
Marginal revenue for any quantity level can be measured by the slope of the
tangent at the relevant point on the total revenue curve.

4. A monopoly firm has a total fixed cost of Rs 100 and has the following
demand schedule:
Find the short run equilibrium quantity, price and total profit. What would be
the equilibrium in the long run? In case the total cost was Rs 1000, describe the
equilibrium in the short run and in the long run.
The average revenue is a declining curve if and only if the value of the marginal
revenue is lesser than the average revenue.
The steeper is the negatively sloped demand curve, the further below is the
marginal revenue curve.
The demand curve is elastic when marginal revenue has a positive value, and
inelastic when the marginal revenue has a negative value.
If the monopoly firm has zero costs or only has fixed cost, the quantity supplied
in equilibrium is given by the point where marginal revenue is zero. In
contrast, perfect competition would supply an equilibrium quantity given by
the point where average revenue is zero.
Equilibrium of a monopoly firm is defined as the point where MR = MC
and MC is rising. This point provides the equilibrium quantity produced.
The equilibrium price is provided by the demand curve given the
equilibrium quantity.
Positive short run profit to a monopoly firm continue in the long run.
Monopolistic competition in a commodity market arises due to the commodity
being non-homogenous.
In monopolistic competition, the short run equilibrium results in quantity
produced being lesser and prices being higher compared to perfect
competition. This situation persists in the long run, but long run profits
are zero.
Oligopoly in a commodity market occurs when there are a small number of
firms producing a homogenous commodity.

5. If the monopolist firm of Exercise 3, was a public sector firm. The government
set a rule for its manager to accept the goverment fixed price as given (i.e. to be
a price taker and therefore behave as a firm in a perfectly competitive market),
and the government decide to set the price so that demand and supply in the
market are equal. What would be the equilibrium price, quantity and profit in
this case?
6. Comment on the shape of the MR curve in case the TR curve is a (i) positively
sloped straight line, (ii) horizontal straight line.
7. The market demand curve for a commodity and the total cost for a monopoly
firm producing the commodity is given by the schedules  below. Use the
information to calculate the following:
(a) The MR and MC schedules
(b) The quantites for which the MR and MC are equal
(c) The equilibrium quantity of output and the equilibrium price of the
commodity
(d) The total revenue, total cost and total profit in equilibrium.
8. Will the monopolist firm continue to produce in the short run if a loss is incurred
at the best short run level of output?
9. Explain why the demand curve facing a firm under monopolistic competition is
negatively sloped.
10. What is the reason for the long run equilibrium of a firm in monopolistic
competition to be associated with zero profit?
11. List the three different ways in which oligopoly firms may behave.
12. If duopoly behaviour is one that is described by Cournot, the market demand
curve is given by the equation q = 200 – 4p, and both the firms have zero costs,
find the quantity supplied by each firm in equilibrium and the equilibrium
market price.
13. What is meant by prices being rigid? How can oligopoly behaviour lead to such
an outcome?
