7. (a)
x + y + z = 360°
(b) x + y + z + w = 360°
EXERCISE 3.2
1. (a)
360° – 250° = 110°
(b) 360° – 310° = 50°
°  = 40°
°  = 24°
24  = 15 (sides)
4. Number of sides = 24
No; (Since 22 is not a divisor of 360)
No; (because each exterior angle is 180° – 22° = 158°, which is not a divisor of 360°).
6. (a)
The equilateral triangle being a regular polygon of 3 sides has the least measure of an interior
angle = 60°.
By (a), we can see that the greatest exterior angle is 120°.
EXERCISE 3.3
BC(Opposite sides are equal)
(ii) ∠ DAB (Opposite angles are equal)

(iv) x = 100°;  y = 80°;  z = 80°
y = 112°; x = 28°; z = 28°
Can be, but need not be.
No; (in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal; but here, AD ≠ BC).
(iii)
No; (in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal; but here, ∠A ≠ ∠C).
4. A kite, for example
5. 108°; 72°;
6. Each is a right angle.
7. x = 110°;  y = 40°;  z = 30°
x = 6;  y = 9  (ii)   x = 3;  y = 13;
9.  x = 50°
NM || KL  (sum of interior opposite angles is 180°). So, KLMN is a trapezium.

EXERCISE 3.4
1. (b), (c), (f), (g), (h) are true; others are false.
2. (a)
Rhombus; square.
(b) Square; rectangle
A square is 4 – sided; so it is a quadrilateral.
A square has its opposite sides parallel; so it is a parallelogram.
(iii)
A square is a parallelogram with all the 4 sides equal; so it is a rhombus.
A square is a parallelogram with each angle a right angle; so it is a rectangle.
Parallelogram; rhombus; square; rectangle.
Rhombus; square
(iii) Square; rectangle
5. Both of its diagonals lie in its interior.
AD || BC; AB ||DC. So, in parallelogram ABCD, the mid-point of diagonal AC is O.

JUST FOR FUN
1. More about Pythagorean triplets
We have seen one way of writing pythagorean triplets as 2m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1.
A pythagorean triplet a, b, c means a2 + b2 = c2. If we use two natural numbers m and n(m > n), and
take a = m2 – n2, b = 2mn, c = m2 + n2, then we can see that c2 = a2 + b2.
Thus for different values of m and n with m > n we can generate natural numbers a, b, c such that they
form Pythagorean triplets.
For example: Take, m = 2, n = 1.
Then, a = m2 – n2 = 3, b = 2mn = 4, c = m2 + n2 = 5, is a Pythagorean triplet. (Check it!)
For, m = 3, n = 2, we get,
a = 5, b = 12, c = 13 which is again a Pythagorean triplet.
Take some more values for m and n and generate more such triplets.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked
to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a
child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to
encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We
must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with
the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and
initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in
the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation
will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy
experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the
problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater
consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible
for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,
Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Dr H.K. Dewan for guiding the work of
this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to
their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which
have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation
committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Preface
This is the final book of the upper primary series. It has been an interesting journey to define mathematics
learning in a different way. The attempt has been to retain the nature of mathematics, engage with the
question why learn mathematics while making an attempt to create materials that would address the
interest of the learners at this stage and provide sufficient and approachable challenge to them. There
have been many views on the purpose of school mathematics. These range from the fully utilitarian to
the entirely aesthetic perceptions. Both these end up not engaging with the concepts and enriching the
apparatus available to the learner for participating in life. The NCF emphasises the need for developing
the ability to mathematise ideas and perhaps experiences as well. An ability to explore the ideas and
framework given by mathematics in the struggle to find a richer life and a more meaningful relationship
with the world around.
This is not even easy to comprehend, far more difficult to operationalise. But NCF adds to this an
even more difficult goal. The task is to involve everyone of that age group in the classroom or outside
in doing mathematics. This is the aim we have been attempting to make in the series.
We have, therefore, provided space for children to engage in reflection, creating their own rules
and definitions based on problems/tasks solved and following their ideas logically. The emphasis is not
on remembering algorithms, doing complicated arithmetical problems or remembering proofs, but
understanding how mathematics works and being able to identify the way of moving towards solving
problems.
The important concern for us has also been to ensure that all students at this stage learn mathematics
and begin to feel confident in relating mathematics. We have attempted to help children read the book
and to stop and reflect at each step where a new idea has been presented. In order to make the book
less formidable we have included illustrations and diagrams. These combined with the text help the
child comprehend the idea. Throughout the series and also therefore in this book we have tried to
avoid the use of technical words and complex formulations. We have left many things for the student to
describe and write in her own words.
We have made an attempt to use child friendly language. To attract attention to some points blurbs
have been used. The attempt has been to reduce the weight of long explanations by using these and the
diagrams. The illustrations and fillers also attempt to break the monotony and provide contexts.
Class VIII is the bridge to Class IX where children will deal with more formal mathematics. The
attempt here has been to introduce some ideas in a way that is moving towards becoming formal. The
tasks included expect generalisation from the gradual use of such language by the child.
The team that developed this textbook consisted teachers with experience and appreciation of
children learning mathematics. This team also included people with experience of research in mathematics
teaching-learning and an experience of producing materials for children. The feedback on the textbooks
for Classes VI and VII was kept in mind while developing this textbook. This process of
development also included discussions with teachers during review workshop on the manuscript.
In the end, I would like to express the grateful thanks of our team to Professor Krishna Kumar,
Director, NCERT, Professor G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT and Professor Hukum Singh,
Head, DESM, for giving us an opportunity to work on this task with freedom and with full support. I
am also grateful to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the Advisory Group in Science and
Mathematics for his suggestions. I am also grateful for the support of the team members from NCERT,
Professor S.K. Singh Gautam, Dr V.P. Singh and in particular Dr Ashutosh K. Wazalwar who
coordinated this work and made arrangements possible. In the end I must thank the Publication
Department of NCERT for its support and advice and those from Vidya Bhawan who helped produce
the book.
It need not be said but I cannot help mentioning that all the authors worked as a team and we
accepted ideas and advice from each other. We stretched ourselves to the fullest and hope that we
have done some justice to the challenge posed before us.
The process of developing materials is, however, a continuous one and we would hope to
make this book better. Suggestions and comments on the book are most welcome.

A Note for the Teacher
This is the third and the last book of this series. It is a continuation of the processes initiated to help the
learners in abstraction of ideas and principles of mathematics. Our students to be able to deal with
mathematical ideas and use them need to have the logical foundations to abstract and use postulates
and construct new formulations. The main points reflected in the NCF-2005 suggest relating mathematics
to development of wider abilities in children, moving away from complex calculations and algorithm
following to understanding and constructing a framework of understanding. As you know, mathematical
ideas do not develop by telling them. They also do not reach children by merely giving explanations.
Children need their own framework of concepts and a classroom where they are discussing ideas,
looking for solutions to problems, setting new problems and finding their own ways of solving problems
and their own definitions.
As we have said before, it is important to help children to learn to read the textbook and other
books related to mathematics with understanding. The reading of materials is clearly required to help
the child learn further mathematics. In Class VIII please take stock of where the students have reached
and give them more opportunities to read texts that use language with symbols and have brevity and
terseness with no redundancy. For this if you can, please get them to read other texts as well. You
could also have them relate the physics they learn and the equations they come across in chemistry to
the ideas they have learnt in mathematics. These cross-disciplinary references would help them develop
a framework and purpose for mathematics. They need to be able to reconstruct logical arguments and
appreciate the need for keeping certain factors and constraints while they relate them to other areas as
well. Class VIII children need to have opportunity for all this.
As we have already emphasised, mathematics at the Upper Primary Stage has to be close to the
experience and environment of the child and be abstract at the same time. From the comfort of context
and/or models linked to their experience they need to move towards working with ideas. Learning to
abstract helps formulate and understand arguments. The capacity to see interrelations among concepts
helps us deal with ideas in other subjects as well. It also helps us understand and make better patterns,
maps, appreciate area and volume and see similarities between shapes and sizes. While this is regarding
the relationship of other fields of knowledge to mathematics, its meaning in life and our environment
needs to be re-emphasised.
Children should be able to identify the principles to be used in contextual situations, for solving
problems sift through and choose the relevant information as the first important step. Once students do
that they need to be able to find the way to use the knowledge they have and reach where the problem
requires them to go.  They need to identify and define a problem, select or design possible solutions and
revise or redesign the steps, if required. As they go further there would be more to of this to be done. In
Class VIII we have to get them to be conscious of the steps they follow.  Helping children to develop the
ability to construct appropriate models by breaking up the problems and evolving their own strategies
and analysis of problems is extremely important. This is in the place of giving them prescriptive algorithms
Cooperative learning, learning through conversations, desire and capacity to learn from each other
and the recognition that conversation is not noise and consultation not cheating is an important part of
change in attitude for you as a teacher and for the students as well. They should be asked to make
presentations as a group with the inclusion of examples from the contexts of their own experiences.
They should be encouraged to read the book in groups and formulate and express what they understand
from it. The assessment pattern has to recognise and appreciate this and the classroom groups should
be such that all children enjoy being with each other and are contributing to the learning of the group.
As you would have seen different groups use different strategies. Some of these are not as efficient as
others as they reflect the modeling done and reflect the thinking used. All these are appropriate and
need to be analysed with children. The exposure to a variety of strategies deepens the mathematical
understanding. Each group moves from where it is and needs to be given an opportunity for that.
For conciseness we present the key ideas of mathematics learning that we would like you to
remember in your classroom.
1. Enquiry to understand is one of the natural ways by which students acquire and construct knowledge.
The process can use generation of observations to acquire knowledge. Students need to deal with
different forms of questioning and challenging investigations- explorative, open-ended, contextual
and even error detection from geometry, arithmetic and generalising it to algebraic relations etc.
2. Children need to learn to provide and follow logical arguments, find loopholes in the arguments
presented and understand the requirement of a proof. By now children have entered the formal
stage. They need to be encouraged to exercise creativity and imagination and to communicate their
mathematical reasoning both verbally and in writing.
3. The mathematics classroom should relate language to learning of mathematics. Children should talk
about their ideas using their experiences and language. They should be encouraged to use their
own words and language but also gradually shift to formal language and use of symbols.
4. The number system has been taken to the level of generalisation of rational numbers and their properties
and developing a framework that includes all previous systems as sub-sets of the generalised rational
numbers. Generalisations are to be presented in mathematical language and children have to see that
algebra and its language helps us express a lot of text in small symbolic forms.
5. As before children should be required to set and solve a lot of problems. We hope that as the
nature of the problems set up by them becomes varied and more complex, they would become
confident of the ideas they are dealing with.
6. Class VIII book has attempted to bring together the different aspects of mathematics and emphasise
the commonality. Unitary method, Ratio and proportion, Interest and dividends are all part of one
common logical framework. The idea of variable and equations is needed wherever we need to
find an unknown quantity in any branch of mathematics.
We hope that the book will help children learn to enjoy mathematics and be confident in the
concepts introduced. We want to recommend the creation of opportunity for thinking individually and
collectively.
We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the book and hope that you will
send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that you develop during the course of teaching, to be
included in the future editions. This can only happen if you would find time to listen carefully to children
and identify gaps and on the other hand also find the places where they can be given space to articulate
their ideas and verbalise their thoughts.

RATIONAL NUMBERS  1
1.1  Introduction
In Mathematics, we frequently come across simple equations to be solved. For example,
the equation
x + 2 = 13
is solved when x = 11, because this value of x satisfies the given equation. The  solution
11 is a natural number. On the other hand, for the equation
x + 5 = 5
the solution gives the whole number 0 (zero). If we consider only natural numbers,
equation (2) cannot be solved. To solve equations like (2), we added the number zero to
the collection of natural numbers and obtained the whole numbers. Even whole numbers
will not be sufficient to solve equations of type
x + 18 = 5
Do you see ‘why’? We require the number –13 which is not a whole number. This
led us to think of integers, (positive and negative). Note that the positive integers
correspond to natural numbers. One may think that we have enough numbers to solve all
simple equations with the available list of integers. Consider the equations
2x  = 3
5x + 7 = 0
for which we cannot find a solution from the integers. (Check this)
We need the numbers 3
2  to solve equation (4) and 7
− to solve
equation (5). This leads us to the collection of rational numbers.
We have already seen basic operations on rational
numbers. We now try to explore some properties of operations
on the different types of numbers seen so far.
Rational Numbers

MATHEMATICS
1.2  Properties of Rational Numbers
1.2.1  Closure
(i) Whole numbers
Let us revisit the closure property for all the operations on whole numbers in brief.

In general, if a and b are any two
whole numbers, their product ab
is a whole number.
Division
5 ÷ 8 = 5
8 , which is  not a
whole number.
Check for closure property under all the four operations for natural numbers.
(ii) Integers
Let us now recall the operations under which integers are closed.

for any two integers a and b.
Subtraction

Is 8 – (– 6) an integer?
In general, for any two integers
a and b, a – b is again an integer.
Check if b – a is also an integer.
Multiplication

Integers are closed under

You have seen that whole numbers are closed under addition and multiplication but
not under subtraction and division. However, integers are closed under addition, subtraction
and multiplication but not under division.
(iii) Rational numbers
Recall that a number which can be written in the form p
q , where p and q are integers
and q ≠ 0 is called a rational number. For example,
7  are all rational
numbers. Since the numbers 0, –2, 4 can be written in the form p
q , they are also
rational numbers. (Check it!)

Can you say that rational numbers are closed under division?
We find that for any rational number a, a ÷ 0 is not defined.
So rational numbers are not closed under division.
However, if we exclude zero then the collection of, all other rational numbers is
closed under division.

Subtraction is not associative for rational numbers.

– 5 + 0 = ... + ... = – 5
(Addition of 0 to an integer)

(Addition of 0 to a rational number)
RATIONAL NUMBERS  11
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
You have done such additions earlier also. Do a few more such additions.
What do you observe? You will find that when you add 0 to a whole number, the sum
is again that whole number. This happens for integers and rational numbers also.
In general,
a + 0 = 0 + a = a,
where a is a whole number
b + 0 = 0 + b = b,
where b is an integer
c + 0 = 0 + c = c,
where c is a rational number
Zero is called the identity for the addition of rational numbers. It is the additive
identity for integers and whole numbers as well.
1.2.5 The role of 1
We have,
5 × 1 = 5 = 1 × 5
(Multiplication of 1 with a whole number)
−× 1 = ... × ... = 2
8 × ... = 1 × 3
8  =  3
What do you find?
You will find that when you multiply any rational number with 1, you get back that
rational number as the product. Check this for a few more rational numbers. You will find
that, a × 1 = 1 × a = a for any rational number a.
We say that 1 is the multiplicative identity for rational numbers.
Is 1 the multiplicative identity for integers? For whole numbers?
If a property holds for rational numbers, will it also hold for integers? For whole
numbers? Which will? Which will not?
1.2.6  Negative of a number
While studying integers you have come across negatives of integers. What is the negative
of 1? It is – 1 because 1 + (– 1) = (–1) + 1 = 0
So, what will be the negative of (–1)? It will be 1.
Also, 2 + (–2) = (–2) + 2 = 0, so we say 2 is the negative or additive inverse of
–2 and vice-versa. In general, for an integer a, we have, a + (– a) = (– a) + a = 0; so, a
is the negative of – a and – a is the negative of a.
For the rational number 2
3 , we have,
⎠ = 2
MATHEMATICS
Also,
(How?)
Similarly,
In general, for a rational number a

b  and a
b  is the additive inverse of
1.2.7  Reciprocal
By which rational number would you multiply 8
21 , to get the product 1? Obviously by
, since
Similarly, 5
− must be multiplied by 7
− so as to get the product 1.
We say that 21
8  is the reciprocal of 8
21  and
is the reciprocal of 5
Can you say what is the reciprocal of 0 (zero)?
Is there a rational number which when multiplied by 0 gives 1?  Thus, zero has no reciprocal.
We say that a rational number c
d  is called the reciprocal or multiplicative inverse of
another rational number a
b  if

Representation of Rational Numbers on the
Number Line
You have learnt to represent natural numbers, whole numbers, integers
and rational numbers on a number line. Let us revise them.
Natural numbers
Whole numbers
Integers
(iii)
Rational numbers
The point on the number line (iv) which is half way between 0 and 1 has been
labelled 1
. Also, the first of the equally spaced points that divides the distance between
0 and 1 into three equal parts can be labelled 1
3 , as on number line (v). How would you
label the second of these division points on number line (v)?
The line extends
indefinitely only to the
right side of 1.
The line extends indefinitely
to the right, but from 0.
There are no numbers to the
left of 0.
The line extends
indefinitely on both sides.
Do you see any numbers
between –1, 0; 0, 1 etc.?
The line extends indefinitely
on both sides. But you can
now see numbers between
–1,  0; 0, 1 etc.
MATHEMATICS
The point to be labelled is twice as far from and to the right of 0 as the point
labelled 1
3 . So it is two times  1
3 , i.e., 2
3 . You can continue to label equally-spaced points on
the number line in the same way. The next marking is 1. You can see that 1 is the same as 3
Then comes 4 5 6
3 3 3  (or 2), 7
3  and so on as shown on the number line (vi)
Similarly, to represent 1
8 , the number line may be divided into eight equal parts as
shown:
We use the number 1
8  to name the first point of this division. The second point of
division will be labelled 2
8 , the third point 3
8 , and so on as shown on number
line (vii)
(vii)
Any rational number can be represented on the number line in this way. In a rational
number, the numeral below the bar, i.e., the denominator, tells the number of equal
parts into which the first unit has been divided. The numeral above the bar i.e., the
numerator, tells ‘how many’ of these parts are considered. So, a rational number
such as 4
9  means four of nine equal parts on the right of 0 (number line viii) and
for 7
−, we make 7 markings of distance 1
4  each on the left of zero and starting
from 0. The seventh marking is 7
− [number line (ix)].

1.4  Rational Numbers between Two Rational Numbers
Can you tell the natural numbers between 1 and 5? They are 2, 3 and 4.
How many natural numbers are there between 7 and 9? There is one and it is 8.
How many natural numbers are there between 10 and 11? Obviously none.
List the integers that lie between –5 and 4. They are – 4, – 3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3.
How many integers are there between –1 and 1?
How many integers are there between –9 and –10?
You will find a definite number of natural numbers (integers) between two natural
numbers (integers).
How many rational numbers are there between 3
10  and 7
You may have thought that they are only 4
10 10  and 6
But you can also write 3
10  as 30
100  and 7
10  as 70
100 . Now the numbers, 31
100 100 100
, ...
100 100 , are all between 3
10  and 7
10 .  The number of these rational numbers is 39.
Also 3
10  can be expressed as 3000
10000  and 7
10  as 7000
10000 . Now, we see that the
rational numbers 3001
,...,
10000 10000
10000 10000  are between 3
10  and 7
10 . These
are 3999 numbers in all.
In this way, we can go on inserting more and more rational numbers between 3
and 7
10 . So unlike natural numbers and integers, the number of rational numbers between
two rational numbers is not definite. Here is one more example.
How many rational numbers are there between 1
− and 3
Obviously 0
10 10 10  are rational numbers between the given numbers.
MATHEMATICS
If we write

10  as 30000
100000 , we get the rational numbers
,...,
100000 100000
29998
100000
, 29999
100000 , between 1
− and 3
You will find that you get countless rational numbers between any two given
rational numbers.
Example 6:  Write any 3 rational numbers between –2 and 0.
Solution: –2 can be written as 20
and 0 as 0
Thus we have 19
, ...,
between –2 and 0.
You can take any three of these.
Example 7: Find any ten rational numbers between 5
− and 5
Solution: We first convert 5
− and 5
8  to rational numbers with the same denominators.
Thus we have 19
,...,
as the rational numbers between 20
and 15
You can take any ten of these.
Another Method
Let us find rational numbers between 1 and 2. One of them is  1.5 or 1
2 . This is the
mean of 1 and 2. You have studied mean in Class VII.
We find that between any two given numbers, we need not necessarily get an
integer but there will always lie a rational number.
We can use the idea of mean also to find rational numbers between any two given
rational numbers.
Example 8:  Find a rational number between 1
4  and 1
Solution: We find the mean of the given rational numbers.
8  lies between 1
4 and 1
This can be seen on the number line also.

If a and b are two rational numbers, then

This again shows that there are countless number of rational numbers between any
two given rational numbers.
Example 9: Find three rational numbers between 1
4  and 1
Solution:  We find the mean of the given rational numbers.
As given in the above example, the mean is  3
8  and 1
We now find another rational number between 1
8 . For this, we again find the mean
8 . That is,
Now find the mean of 3
2 . We have,
Thus we get 1

LINEAR EQUATIONS IN ONE VARIABLE  21
2.1  Introduction
In the earlier classes, you have come across several algebraic expressions and equations.
Some examples of expressions we have so far worked with are:
5x, 2x – 3, 3x + y, 2xy + 5, xyz + x + y + z, x2 + 1, y + y2
Some examples of equations are: 5x = 25, 2x – 3 = 9,
You would remember that equations use the equality (=) sign; it is missing in expressions.
Of these given expressions, many have more than one variable. For example, 2xy + 5
has two variables. We however, restrict to expressions with only one variable when we
form equations. Moreover, the expressions we use to form equations are linear. This means
that the highest power of the variable appearing in the expression is 1.
These are linear expressions:
2x, 2x + 1, 3y – 7, 12 – 5z, 5 ( – 4)
These are not linear expressions:
x2 + 1, y + y2, 1 + z + z2 + z3
(since highest power of variable > 1)
Here we will deal with equations with linear expressions in one variable only. Such
equations are known as linear equations in one variable. The simple equations which
you studied in the earlier classes were all of this type.
Let us briefly revise what we know:
(a) An algebraic equation is an equality
involving variables. It  has an equality sign.
The expression on the left of the equality sign
is the Left Hand Side (LHS). The expression
on the right of the equality sign is the Right
Hand Side (RHS).
Linear Equations in
One Variable
CHAPTER
2x – 3 = 7
2x – 3 = LHS
7 = RHS
22  MATHEMATICS
(b) In an equation the values of
the expressions on the LHS
and RHS are equal. This
happens to be true only for
certain values of the variable.
These values are the
solutions of the equation.
(c) How to find the solution of an equation?
We assume that the two sides of the equation are balanced.
We perform the same mathematical operations on both
sides of the equation, so that the balance is not disturbed.
A few such steps give the solution.
Solving Equations which have Linear Expressions
on one Side and Numbers on the other Side
Let us recall the technique of solving equations with some examples. Observe the solutions;
they can be any rational number.
Example 1: Find the solution of 2x – 3 = 7
Solution:
Step 1 Add 3 to both sides.
2x – 3 + 3 = 7 + 3
(The balance is not disturbed)
2x = 10
Step 2 Next divide both sides by 2.
x  = 10
x = 5
(required solution)
Example 2: Solve 2y + 9 = 4
Solution: Transposing 9 to RHS
2y  = 4 – 9
2y  = – 5
Dividing both sides by 2,
(solution)
To check the answer: LHS = 2
⎠ + 9  = – 5 + 9 = 4 = RHS
(as required)
Do you notice that the solution
⎠ is a rational number? In Class VII, the equations
we solved did not have such solutions.
x = 5 is the solution of the equation
2x – 3 = 7. For  x = 5,
LHS = 2 × 5 – 3 = 7 = RHS
On the other hand x = 10 is not a solution of the
equation. For x = 10,  LHS = 2 × 10 –3 = 17.
This is not equal to the RHS
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN ONE VARIABLE  23
Example 3: Solve
Solution: Transposing 5
2 to the RHS, we get 3
x  = 3
x  = – 4
Multiply both sides by 3,
x = – 4 × 3
x = – 12
(solution)
Check: LHS = 12
=  RHS
(as required)
Do you now see that the coefficient of a variable in an equation need not be an integer?
Example 4: Solve 15
4  – 7x = 9
Solution: We have
4  – 7x = 9
– 7x = 9 – 15
(transposing 15
4  to R H S)
– 7x = 21
(dividing both sides by – 7)
(solution)
Check:  LHS =
⎠= 15
=  RHS

2.3 Some Applications
We begin with a simple example.
Sum of two numbers is 74. One of the numbers is 10 more than the other. What are the
numbers?
We have a puzzle here. We do not know either of the two numbers, and we have to
find them. We are given two conditions.
(i) One of the numbers is 10 more than the other.
(ii) Their sum is 74.
We already know from Class VII how to proceed. If the smaller number is taken to
be x, the larger number is 10 more than x, i.e., x + 10. The other condition says that
the sum of these two numbers x and x + 10 is 74.
This means that x + (x + 10) = 74.
2x + 10 = 74
Transposing 10 to RHS,
2x = 74 – 10
2x = 64
Dividing both sides by 2,
x = 32.  This is one number.
The other number is
x + 10 = 32 + 10 = 42
The desired numbers are 32 and 42.  (Their sum is indeed 74 as given and also one
number is 10 more than the other.)
We shall now consider several examples to show how useful this method is.
Example 5: What should be added to twice the rational number 7
− to get 3
Solution:  Twice the rational number 7
. Suppose x added to this
number gives 3
7 ; i.e.,
⎠ = 3
x = 3
(transposing 14
3  to RHS)
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN ONE VARIABLE  25
Thus 107
21  should be added to
⎠ to give 3
Example 6: The perimeter of a rectangle is 13 cm and its width is
2 4  cm. Find its
length.
Solution:  Assume the length of the rectangle to be x cm.
The perimeter of the rectangle = 2 × (length + width)
= 2 × (x +
2 4 )
The perimeter is given to be 13 cm. Therefore,
⎠ = 13
(dividing both sides by 2)
x = 13
The length of the rectangle is 3
Example 7: The present age of Sahil’s mother is three times the present age of Sahil.
After 5 years their ages will add to 66 years. Find their present ages.
Solution: Let Sahil’s present age be x years.
It is given that this sum is 66 years.
Therefore,
4x + 10 = 66
This equation determines Sahil’s present age which is x years. To solve the equation,
We could also choose Sahil’s age
5 years later to be x and proceed.
Why don’t you try it that way?
Sahil
Mother
Present age
Age 5 years later
x + 5
3x + 5
4x + 10
26  MATHEMATICS
we transpose 10 to RHS,
4x = 66 – 10
4x = 56
x = 56
4  = 14
(solution)
Thus, Sahil’s present age is 14 years and his mother’s age is 42 years. (You may easily
check that 5 years from now the sum of their ages will be 66 years.)
Example 8: Bansi has 3 times as many two-rupee coins as he has five-rupee coins. If
he has in all a sum of ` 77, how many coins of each denomination does he have?
Solution: Let the number of five-rupee coins that Bansi has be x. Then the number of
two-rupee coins he has is 3 times x or 3x.
The amount Bansi has:
(i) from 5 rupee coins, ` 5 × x = ` 5x
(ii) from 2 rupee coins, ` 2 × 3x = ` 6x
Hence the total money he has = ` 11x
But this is given to be ` 77; therefore,
11x = 77
x = 77
11  = 7
Thus,
number of five-rupee coins = x = 7
number of two-rupee coins = 3x = 21
(solution)
(You can check that the total money with Bansi is ` 77.)
Example 9: The sum of three consecutive multiples of 11 is 363.  Find these
multiples.
Solution: If x is a multiple of 11, the next multiple is x + 11.  The next to this is
x + 11 + 11 or x + 22.  So we can take three consecutive multiples of 11 as x, x + 11 and
x + 22.
It is given that the sum of these consecutive
multiples of 11 is 363. This will give the
following equation:
x + (x + 11) + (x + 22) = 363
x + x + 11 + x + 22 = 363
3x + 33 = 363
3x = 363 – 33
3x = 330
Alternatively, we may think of the multiple
of 11 immediately before x.  This is (x – 11).
Therefore, we may take three consecutive
multiples of 11 as x – 11, x, x + 11.
In this case we arrive at the equation
(x – 11) + x + (x + 11) = 363
3x = 363
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN ONE VARIABLE  27
x = 330
= 110
Hence, the three consecutive multiples
are 110, 121, 132 (answer).
We can see that we can adopt different ways to find a solution for the problem.
Example 10:  The difference between two whole numbers is 66.  The ratio of the two
numbers is 2 : 5. What are the two numbers?
Solution: Since the ratio of the two numbers is 2 : 5, we may take one number to be
2x and the other to be 5x. (Note that 2x : 5x is same as 2 : 5.)
The difference between the two numbers is (5x – 2x). It is given that the difference
is 66. Therefore,
5x – 2x = 66
3x = 66
x = 22
Since the numbers are 2x and 5x, they are 2 × 22 or 44 and 5 × 22 or 110, respectively.
The difference between the two numbers is 110 – 44 = 66 as desired.
Example 11:  Deveshi has a total of ` 590 as currency notes in the denominations of
` 50, ` 20 and ` 10. The ratio of  the number of ` 50 notes and ` 20 notes is 3:5. If she has
a total of  25 notes, how many notes of each denomination she has?
Solution:  Let the number of ` 50 notes and ` 20 notes be 3x and 5x, respectively.
But she has 25 notes in total.
Therefore, the number of ` 10 notes = 25 – (3x + 5x) = 25 – 8x
The amount she has
from ` 50 notes : 3x × 50 = ` 150x
from ` 20 notes : 5x × 20 = ` 100x
from ` 10 notes : (25 – 8x) × 10 = ` (250 – 80x)
Hence the total money  she has =150x + 100x + (250 – 80x) = ` (170x + 250)
But she has ` 590. Therefore,
170x + 250 = 590
170x = 590 – 250 = 340
x = 340
170  = 2
The number of ` 50 notes she has = 3x
= 3 × 2 = 6
The number of ` 20 notes she has = 5x = 5 × 2 = 10
The number of ` 10 notes she has = 25 – 8x
= 25 – (8 × 2) = 25 – 16 = 9
or          x = 363
3 = 121.   Therefore,
x = 121, x – 11 = 110, x + 11 = 132
Hence, the three consecutive multiples are
110, 121, 132.

LINEAR EQUATIONS IN ONE VARIABLE  29
Solving Equations having the Variable on
both Sides
An equation is the equality of the values of two expressions. In the equation 2x – 3 = 7,
the two expressions are  2x – 3 and 7.  In most examples that we have come across so
far, the RHS is just a number.  But this need not always be so; both sides could have
expressions with variables.  For example, the equation  2x – 3 = x + 2 has expressions
with a variable on both sides; the expression on the LHS is (2x – 3) and the expression
on the RHS is (x + 2).
• We now discuss how to solve such equations which have expressions with the variable
on both sides.
Example 12: Solve 2x – 3 = x + 2
Solution: We have
2x = x + 2 + 3
2x = x + 5
2x – x = x + 5 – x
(subtracting x from both sides)
x = 5
(solution)
Here we subtracted from both sides of the equation, not a number (constant), but a
term involving the variable. We can do this as variables are also numbers. Also, note that
subtracting x from both sides amounts to transposing x to LHS.
Example 13: Solve 5x + 7
Solution: Multiply both sides of the equation by 2. We get
(2 × 5x) +
10x + 7 = 3x – 28
10x – 3x + 7 = – 28
(transposing 3x to LHS)
7x + 7 = – 28

7x = – 35
x = – 5

2.5  Some More Applications
Example 14: The digits of a two-digit number differ by 3.  If the digits are interchanged,
and the resulting number is added to the original number, we get 143.  What can be the
original number?
Solution: Take, for example, a two-digit number, say, 56. It can be written as
56 = (10 × 5) + 6.
If the digits in 56 are interchanged, we get 65, which can be written as (10 × 6 ) + 5.
Let us take the two digit number such that the digit in the units place is b. The digit
in the tens place differs from b by 3.  Let us take it as b + 3.  So the two-digit number
is 10 (b + 3) + b = 10b + 30 + b = 11b + 30.
With interchange of digits, the resulting two-digit number will be
10b + (b + 3) = 11b + 3
If we add these two two-digit numbers, their sum is
(11b + 30) + (11b + 3)  = 11b + 11b + 30 + 3 = 22b + 33
It is given that the sum is 143. Therefore,  22b + 33 = 143
22b = 143 – 33
22b = 110
b = 110
b = 5
The units digit is 5 and therefore the tens digit is 5 + 3
which is 8. The number is 85.
Check:  On interchange of digits the number we get is
58.  The sum of 85 and 58 is 143 as given.
The statement of the
example is valid for both 58
and 85 and both are correct
answers.

place digit to be
(b – 3)? Try it and see
what solution you get.

digit to be (b – 3)?

Example 15: Arjun is twice as old as Shriya. Five years ago his age was three times
Shriya’s age. Find their present ages.
Solution: Let us take Shriya’s present age to be x years.
Then Arjun’s present age would be 2x years.
Shriya’s age five years ago was (x – 5) years.
Arjun’s age five years ago was (2x – 5) years.
It is given that Arjun’s age five years ago was three times Shriya’s age.
Thus,
2x – 5 = 3(x – 5)
2x – 5 = 3x – 15
15 – 5 = 3x – 2x
10 = x
So, Shriya’s present age = x = 10 years.
Therefore, Arjun’s present age = 2x = 2 × 10 = 20 years.

2.7  Equations Reducible to the Linear Form
Example 18: Solve
Solution: Observe that the equation is not a linear equation, since the expression on its
LHS is not linear. But we can put it into the form of a linear equation. We multiply both
sides of the equation by (2x + 3),
Notice that (2x + 3) gets cancelled on the LHS We have then,
x + 1 = 3 (2
We have now a linear equation which we know how to solve.
Multiplying both sides by 8
8 (x + 1) = 3 (2x + 3)
8x + 8 = 6x + 9
8x = 6x + 9 – 8
8x = 6x + 1
8x – 6x = 1
2x = 1
x = 1
The solution is x = 1

After eight years. Anu’s age = (4x + 8) years;
After eight years, Raj’s age = (5x + 8) years.
Therefore, the ratio of their ages after eight years = 4
This is given to be 5 : 6
Therefore,
Cross-multiplication gives
6 (4x + 8) = 5 (5x + 8)
24x + 48 = 25x + 40
24x + 48 – 40 = 25x
24x + 8 = 25x
8 = 25x – 24x
8 = x
Therefore,
Anu’s present age = 4x = 4 × 8 = 32 years
Raj’s present age = 5x = 5 × 8 = 40 years

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. An algebraic equation is an equality involving variables. It says that the value of the expression on
one side of the equality sign is equal to the value of the expression on the other side.
2. The equations we study in Classes VI, VII and VIII are linear equations in one variable. In such
equations, the expressions which form the equation contain only one variable. Further, the equations
are linear, i.e., the highest power of the variable appearing in the equation is 1.
3. A linear equation may have for its solution any rational number.
4. An equation may have linear expressions on both sides. Equations that we studied in Classes VI
and VII had just a number on one side of the equation.
5. Just as numbers, variables can, also, be transposed from one side of the equation to the other.
6. Occasionally, the expressions forming equations have to be simplified before we can solve them
by usual methods. Some equations may not even be linear to begin with, but they can be brought
to a linear form by multiplying both sides of the equation by a suitable expression.
7. The utility of linear equations is in their diverse applications; different problems on numbers, ages,
perimeters, combination of currency notes, and so on can be solved using linear equations.

You already know what we mean by interior and exterior of a closed curve (Fig 3.2).

Here are some convex polygons and some concave polygons. (Fig 3.3)
Convex polygons
Concave polygons
Can you find how these types of polygons differ from one another? Polygons that are
convex have no portions of their diagonals in their exteriors. Is this true with concave polygons?
Study the figures given. Then try to describe in your own words what we mean by a convex
polygon and what we mean by a concave polygon. Give two rough sketches of each kind.
In our work in this class, we will be dealing with convex polygons only.
3.2.4  Regular and irregular polygons
A regular polygon is both ‘equiangular’ and ‘equilateral’. For example, a square has sides of
equal length and angles of equal measure. Hence it is a regular polygon. A rectangle is
equiangular but not equilateral. Is a rectangle a regular polygon? Is an equilateral triangle a
regular polygon? Why?

In the previous classes, have you come across any quadrilateral that is equilateral but not
equiangular? Recall the quadrilateral shapes you saw in earlier classes – Rectangle, Square,
Rhombus etc.
Is there a triangle that is equilateral but not equiangular?
3.2.5  Angle sum property
Do you remember the angle-sum property of a triangle? The sum of the measures of the
three angles of a triangle is 180°. Recall the methods by which we tried to visualise this
fact. We now extend these ideas to a quadrilateral.
1. Take any quadrilateral, say ABCD (Fig 3.4). Divide
it into two triangles, by drawing a diagonal. You get
six angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Use the angle-sum property of a triangle and argue
how the sum of the measures of ∠A, ∠B, ∠C and
∠D amounts to 180° + 180° = 360°.
2. Take four congruent card-board copies of any quadrilateral ABCD, with angles
as shown [Fig 3.5 (i)]. Arrange the copies as shown in the figure, where angles
∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4 meet at a point [Fig 3.5 (ii)].
Fig 3.4
What can you say about the sum of the angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4?
[Note: We denote the angles by ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, etc., and their respective measures
by m∠1, m∠2, m∠3, etc.]
The sum of the measures of the four angles of a quadrilateral is___________.
You may arrive at this result in several other ways also.
Fig 3.5
For doing this you may
have to turn and match
appropriate corners so
that they fit.
UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  41
3. As before consider quadrilateral ABCD (Fig 3.6). Let P be any
point in its interior. Join P to vertices A, B, C and D. In the figure,
consider ΔPAB. From this we see x = 180° –  m∠2 – m∠3;
similarly from ΔPBC,  y = 180° – m∠4 – m∠5, from ΔPCD,
z = 180º – m∠6 – m∠7 and from ΔPDA, w = 180º – m∠8
– m∠1. Use this to find the total measure m∠1 + m∠2 + ...
+ m∠8, does it help you to arrive at the result? Remember
∠x + ∠y + ∠z + ∠w = 360°.
4. These quadrilaterals were convex. What would happen if the
quadrilateral is not convex? Consider quadrilateral ABCD. Split it
into two triangles and find the sum of the interior angles (Fig 3.7).

3.3  Sum of the Measures of the Exterior Angles of a
Polygon
On many occasions a knowledge of exterior angles may throw light on the nature of
interior angles and sides.

DO THIS
Fig 3.8
TRY THESE
Draw a polygon on the floor, using a piece of chalk.
(In the figure, a pentagon ABCDE is shown) (Fig 3.8).
We want to know the total measure of angles, i.e,
m∠1 + m∠2 + m∠3 + m∠4 + m∠5. Start at A. Walk
along AB . On reaching B, you need to turn through an
angle of m∠1, to walk along BC . When you reach at C,
you need to turn through an angle of m∠2 to walk along
CD. You continue to move in this manner, until you return
to side AB. You would have in fact made one complete turn.
Therefore,  m∠1 + m∠2 + m∠3 + m∠4 + m∠5  = 360°
This is true whatever be the number of sides of the polygon.
Therefore, the sum of the measures of the external angles of any polygon is 360°.
Example 1: Find measure x in Fig 3.9.
Solution:
x + 90° + 50° + 110° = 360°      (Why?)
x + 250° = 360°
x = 110°
Take a regular hexagon Fig 3.10.

has a measure of 45°.
Solution: Total measure of all exterior angles = 360°
Measure of each exterior angle = 45°
Therefore, the number of exterior angles = 360

3.4  Kinds of Quadrilaterals
Based on the nature of the sides or angles of a quadrilateral, it gets special names.
3.4.1  Trapezium
Trapezium is a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides.
These are trapeziums
These are not trapeziums
Study the above figures and discuss with your friends why some of them are trapeziums
while some are not. (Note: The arrow marks indicate parallel lines).

them as shown (Fig 3.11).

non-parallel sides be equal?
You can get two more trapeziums using the same set of triangles. Find them out and
discuss their shapes.
2. Take four set-squares from your and your friend’s instrument boxes. Use different
numbers of them to place side-by-side and obtain different trapeziums.
If the non-parallel sides of a trapezium are of equal length, we call it an isosceles
trapezium. Did you get an isoceles trapezium in any of your investigations given above?
3.4.2  Kite
Kite is a special type of a quadrilateral. The sides with the same markings in each figure
are equal. For example AB = AD and BC = CD.
These are kites
These are not kites
Study these figures and try to describe what a kite is. Observe that
(i) A kite has 4 sides (It is a quadrilateral).
(ii) There are exactly two distinct consecutive pairs of sides of equal length.
Take a thick white sheet.
Fold the paper once.
Draw two line segments of different lengths as shown in Fig 3.12.
Cut along the line segments and open up.
You have the shape of a kite (Fig 3.13).
Has the kite any line symmetry?
Fold both the diagonals of the kite. Use the set-square to check if they cut at
right angles. Are the diagonals equal in length?
Verify (by paper-folding or measurement) if the diagonals bisect each other.
By folding an angle of the kite on its opposite, check for angles of equal measure.
Observe the diagonal folds; do they indicate any diagonal being an angle bisector?
Share your findings with others and list them. A summary of these results are
given elsewhere in the chapter for your reference.

parallel lines.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel.
3.4.4  Elements of a parallelogram
There are four sides and four angles in a parallelogram. Some of these are
equal. There are some terms associated with these elements that you need
to remember.
Given a parallelogram ABCD (Fig 3.18).
AB  and DC, are opposite sides. AD  and BC  form another pair of opposite sides.
∠A and ∠C are a pair of opposite angles; another pair of opposite angles would be
∠B and ∠D.
AB and BC  are adjacent sides. This means, one of the sides starts where the other
ends. Are BC  and CD adjacent sides too? Try to find two more pairs of adjacent sides.
∠A and ∠B are adjacent angles. They are at the ends of the same side. ∠B and ∠C
are also adjacent. Identify other pairs of adjacent angles of the parallelogram.
Take cut-outs of two identical parallelograms, say ABCD and A′B′C′D′ (Fig 3.19).
Here AB  is same as A B
′ ′  except for the name. Similarly the other corresponding
sides are equal too.
Place A B
′ ′  over DC. Do they coincide? What can you now say about the lengths
AB  and DC?
Similarly examine the lengths AD  and BC . What do you find?
You may also arrive at this result by measuring AB and DC.
Property: The opposite sides of a parallelogram are of equal length.
Take two identical set squares with angles 30° – 60° – 90°
and place them adjacently to form a parallelogram as shown
in Fig 3.20. Does this help you to verify the above property?
You can further strengthen this idea
through a logical argument also.
Consider a parallelogram
ABCD (Fig 3.21). Draw
any one diagonal, say AC.
Fig 3.19
TRY THESE

TRY THESE
Looking at the angles,
∠1 = ∠2
∠3 = ∠4   (Why?)
Since in triangles ABC and ADC,  ∠1 = ∠2,  ∠3 = ∠4
and AC is common, so, by ASA congruency condition,
Δ ABC
Δ CDA
(How is ASA used here?)
This gives
AB = DC
BC = AD.
Example 3: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram PQRS (Fig 3.22).
Solution: In a parallelogram, the opposite sides have same length.
Therefore, PQ = SR = 12 cm
QR = PS = 7 cm
So, Perimeter = PQ + QR + RS + SP
= 12 cm + 7 cm + 12 cm + 7 cm = 38 cm
3.4.5 Angles of a parallelogram
We studied a property of parallelograms concerning the (opposite) sides. What can we
say about the angles?
Let ABCD be a parallelogram (Fig 3.23). Copy it on
a tracing sheet. Name this copy as A′B′C′D′. Place
A′B′C′D′ on ABCD. Pin them together at the point
where the diagonals meet. Rotate the transparent sheet
by 180°. The parallelograms still concide; but you now
find A′ lying exactly on C and vice-versa; similarly B′
lies on D and vice-versa.
Does this tell you anything about the measures of the angles A and C? Examine the
same for angles B and D. State your findings.
Property: The opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure.
Take two identical 30° – 60° – 90° set-squares and form a parallelogram as before.
Does the figure obtained help you to confirm the above property?
You can further justify this idea through logical arguments.
If  AC and BD  are the diagonals of the
parallelogram, (Fig 3.24) you find that
∠1 =∠2
∠3 = ∠4      (Why?)
Fig 3.23
Fig 3.24
UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  49
Fig 3.26
Studying Δ ABC and Δ ADC (Fig 3.25) separately, will help you to see that by ASA
congruency condition,
Δ ABC
Δ CDA
(How?)
Fig 3.25
This shows that ∠B and ∠D have same measure. In the same way you can get
m∠A = m ∠C.
Example 4: In Fig 3.26, BEST is a parallelogram. Find the values x, y and z.
Solution: S is opposite to B.
x = 100° (opposite angles property)
y = 100° (measure of angle corresponding to ∠x)
z = 80°
(since ∠y, ∠z is a linear pair)
We now turn our attention to adjacent angles of a parallelogram.
In parallelogram ABCD, (Fig 3.27).
∠A and ∠D are supplementary since
and with transversal DA , these
two angles are interior opposite.
∠A and ∠B are also supplementary. Can you
say ‘why’?
and BA  is a transversal, making ∠A and ∠B interior opposite.
Identify two more pairs of supplementary angles from the figure.
Property: The adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.
Example 5: In a parallelogram RING, (Fig 3.28) if m∠R = 70°, find all the other
angles.
Solution: Given
m∠R = 70°
m∠N = 70°
because ∠R and ∠N are opposite angles of a parallelogram.
Since ∠R and ∠I are supplementary,
m∠I = 180° – 70° = 110°
Also,
m∠G = 110° since ∠G is opposite to ∠I
Thus,
m∠R = m∠N = 70° and m∠I = m∠G = 110°

After showing m∠R = m∠N = 70°, can you find m∠I and m∠G by any other
method?
3.4.6 Diagonals of a parallelogram
The diagonals of a parallelogram, in general, are not of equal length.
(Did you check this in your earlier activity?) However, the diagonals
of a parallelogram have an interesting property.
Take a cut-out of a parallelogram, say,
ABCD (Fig 3.29). Let its diagonals AC and DB meet at O.
Find the mid point of AC by a fold, placing C on A. Is the
mid-point same as O?
Does this show that diagonal DB bisects the diagonal AC at the point O? Discuss it
with your friends. Repeat the activity to find where the mid point of  DB could lie.
Property: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other (at the point of their
intersection, of course!)
To argue and justify this property is not very
difficult. From Fig 3.30, applying ASA criterion, it
is easy to see that
Δ AOB
Δ COD    (How is ASA used here?)
This gives
AO = CO
BO = DO
Example 6: In Fig 3.31 HELP is a parallelogram. (Lengths are in cms). Given that
OE = 4 and HL is 5 more than PE? Find OH.
Solution : If
OE = 4 then OP also is 4 (Why?)
PE = 8,

Therefore
HL = 8 + 5 = 13
Hence
OH = 1

3.5  Some Special Parallelograms
3.5.1  Rhombus
We obtain a Rhombus (which, you will see, is a parallelogram) as a special case of kite
(which is not a a parallelogram).
Recall the paper-cut kite you made earlier.
Kite-cut
Rhombus-cut
When you cut along ABC and opened up, you got a kite. Here lengths AB and
BC were different. If you draw AB = BC, then the kite you obtain is called a rhombus.
Fig 3.33
Fig 3.34
Fig 3.32
Note that the sides of rhombus are all of same
length; this is not the case with the kite.
A rhombus is a quadrilateral with sides of equal
length.
Since the opposite sides of a rhombus have the same
length, it is also a parallelogram. So, a rhombus has all
the properties of a parallelogram and also that of a
kite. Try to list them out. You can then verify your list
with the check list summarised in the book elsewhere.
Rhombus
UNDERSTANDING QUADRILATERALS  53
DO THIS
The most useful property of a rhombus is that of its diagonals.
Property: The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of one another.
Take a copy of rhombus. By paper-folding verify if the point of intersection is the
mid-point of each diagonal. You may also check if they intersect at right angles, using
the corner of a set-square.
Here is an outline justifying this property using logical steps.
ABCD is a rhombus (Fig 3.35). Therefore it is a parallelogram too.
Since diagonals bisect each other,      OA = OC  and  OB = OD.
We have to show that m∠AOD = m∠COD = 90°
It can be seen that by SAS congruency criterion
Δ AOD
Δ COD
Therefore,
m ∠AOD = m ∠COD
Since ∠AOD and ∠COD are a linear pair,
m ∠AOD = m ∠COD = 90°
Example 7:
RICE is a rhombus (Fig 3.36). Find x, y, z. Justify your findings.
Solution:
x = OE
y = OR
z = side of the rhombus
= OI  (diagonals bisect)
= OC (diagonals bisect)
= 13 (all sides are equal )
3.5.2  A rectangle
A rectangle is a parallelogram with equal angles (Fig 3.37).
What is the full meaning of this definition? Discuss with your friends.
If the rectangle is to be equiangular, what could be
the measure of each angle?
Let the measure of each angle be x°.
4x° = 360°
(Why)?
Therefore,
x° = 90°
Thus each angle of a rectangle is a right angle.
So, a rectangle is a parallelogram in which every angle is a right angle.
Being a parallelogram, the rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and its diagonals
bisect each other.
Fig 3.35
Since AO = CO
(Why?)
AD = CD
(Why?)
OD = OD
Fig 3.36
Fig 3.37
MATHEMATICS
In a parallelogram, the diagonals can be of different lengths. (Check this); but surprisingly
the rectangle (being a special case) has diagonals of equal length.
Property: The diagonals of a rectangle are of equal length.
This is easy to justify. If ABCD is a rectangle (Fig 3.38),  then looking at triangles
ABC and ABD separately [(Fig 3.39) and (Fig 3.40) respectively], we have
Δ ABC ≅Δ ABD
This is because
AB = AB
(Common)
BC = AD
(Why?)
m ∠A = m ∠B = 90°
(Why?)
The congruency follows by SAS criterion.
AC = BD
and in a rectangle the diagonals, besides being equal in length bisect each other (Why?)
Example 8: RENT is a rectangle (Fig 3.41). Its diagonals meet at O. Find x, if
OR = 2x + 4 and OT = 3x + 1.
Solution: OT  is half of the diagonal TE ,
OR  is half of the diagonal RN .
Diagonals are equal here. (Why?)
So, their halves are also equal.
Therefore
3x + 1 = 2x + 4
x = 3
3.5.3  A square
A square is a rectangle with equal sides.
This means a square has all the
properties of a rectangle with an additional
requirement that all the sides have equal
length.
The square, like the rectangle, has
diagonals of equal length.
In a rectangle, there is no requirement
for the diagonals to be perpendicular to
one another, (Check this).

Property: The diagonals of a square are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
Take a square sheet, say PQRS (Fig 3.42).
Fold along both the diagonals. Are their mid-points the same?
Check if the angle at O is 90° by using a set-square.
This verifies the property stated above.
We can justify this also by arguing logically:
ABCD is a square whose diagonals meet at O (Fig 3.43).
OA = OC   (Since the square is a parallelogram)
By SSS congruency condition, we now see that
Δ AOD ≅Δ COD    (How?)
Therefore,
m∠AOD = m∠COD
These angles being a linear pair, each is right angle.

4.1  Introduction
You have learnt how to draw triangles in Class VII. We require three measurements
(of sides and angles) to draw a unique triangle.
Since three measurements were enough to draw a triangle, a natural question arises
whether four measurements would be sufficient to draw a unique four sided closed figure,
namely, a quadrilateral.
Take a pair of sticks of equal lengths, say
10 cm. Take another pair of sticks of
equal lengths, say, 8 cm. Hinge them up
suitably to get a rectangle of length 10 cm
and breadth 8 cm.
This rectangle has been created with
the 4 available measurements.
Now just push along the breadth of
the rectangle. Is the new shape obtained,
still a rectangle (Fig 4.2)? Observe
that the rectangle has now become
a parallelogram. Have you altered the
lengths of the sticks? No! The
measurements of sides remain the same.
Give another push to the newly
obtained shape in a different direction;
what do you get? You again get a
parallelogram, which is altogether different
(Fig 4.3),  yet the four measurements
remain the same.
This shows that 4 measurements of a quadrilateral cannot determine it uniquely.
Can 5 measurements determine a quadrilateral uniquely? Let us go back to the activity!

You have constructed a rectangle with
two sticks each of length 10 cm and other
two sticks each of length 8 cm. Now
introduce another stick of length equal to
BD and tie it along BD (Fig 4.4). If you
push the breadth now, does the shape
change? No! It cannot, without making the
figure open. The introduction of the fifth
stick has fixed the rectangle uniquely, i.e.,
there is no other quadrilateral (with the
given lengths of sides) possible now.
Thus, we observe that five measurements can determine a quadrilateral uniquely.
But will any five measurements (of sides and angles) be sufficient to draw a unique
quadrilateral?
Arshad has five measurements of a quadrilateral ABCD. These are AB = 5 cm,
∠A = 50°, AC = 4 cm, BD = 5 cm and AD = 6 cm. Can he construct a unique
quadrilateral? Give reasons for your answer.
Constructing a Quadrilateral
We shall learn how to construct a unique quadrilateral given the following
measurements:
When four sides and one diagonal are given.
When two diagonals and three sides are given.
When two adjacent sides and three angles are given.
When three sides and two included angles are given.
When other special properties are known.
Let us take up these constructions one-by-one.
4.2.1 When the lengths of four  sides and a diagonal are given
We shall explain this construction through an example.
Example 1: Construct a quadrilateral PQRS
where PQ = 4 cm,QR = 6 cm, RS = 5 cm,
PS = 5.5 cm and PR = 7 cm.
Solution: [A rough sketch will help us in
visualising the quadrilateral. We draw this first and
mark the measurements.] (Fig 4.5)
Fig 4.4
5.5 cm
Fig 4.5
PRACTICAL GEOMETRY  59
Step 1
From the rough sketch, it is easy to see that ΔPQR
can be constructed using SSS construction condition.
Draw ΔPQR (Fig 4.6).
Step 2
Now, we have to locate the fourth point S. This ‘S’
would be on the side opposite to Q with reference to
PR. For that, we have two measurements.
S is 5.5 cm away from P. So, with P as centre, draw
an arc of radius 5.5 cm. (The point S is somewhere
on this arc!) (Fig 4.7).
Step 3
S is 5 cm away from R. So with R as centre, draw an arc of radius 5 cm (The
point S is somewhere on this arc also!) (Fig 4.8).
Fig 4.6

Step 4
S should lie on both the arcs drawn.
So it is the point of intersection of the
two arcs. Mark S and complete PQRS.
PQRS is the required quadrilateral
(Fig 4.9).
(i) We saw that 5 measurements of a quadrilateral can determine a quadrilateral
uniquely. Do you think any five measurements of the quadrilateral can do this?
(ii) Can you draw a parallelogram BATS where BA = 5 cm, AT = 6 cm and
AS = 6.5 cm? Why?
(iii) Can you draw a rhombus ZEAL where ZE = 3.5 cm, diagonal EL = 5 cm? Why?
(iv) A student attempted to draw a quadrilateral PLAY where PL = 3 cm, LA = 4 cm,
AY = 4.5 cm, PY = 2 cm and LY = 6 cm, but could not draw it. What is
the reason?
[Hint: Discuss it using a rough sketch].

4.2.2  When two diagonals and three sides are given
When four sides and a diagonal were given, we first drew a triangle with the available data
and then tried to locate the fourth point. The same technique is used here.
Example 2: Construct a quadrilateral ABCD, given that BC = 4.5 cm, AD = 5.5 cm,
CD = 5 cm the diagonal AC = 5.5 cm and diagonal BD = 7 cm.
Solution:
Here is the rough sketch of the quadrilateral ABCD
(Fig 4.10). Studying this sketch, we can easily see
that it is possible to draw Δ ACD first (How?).
Step 1
Draw Δ ACD using SSS
construction (Fig 4.11).
(We now need to find B at a distance
of 4.5 cm from C and 7 cm from D).
Step 2
With D as centre, draw an arc of radius 7 cm. (B is somewhere
on this arc) (Fig 4.12).
Step 3
With C as centre, draw an arc of
radius 4.5 cm (B is somewhere on
this arc also) (Fig 4.13).

4.2.3  When two adjacent sides and three angles are known
As before, we start with constructing a triangle and then look for the fourth point to
complete the quadrilateral.
Example 3: Construct a quadrilateral MIST where MI = 3.5 cm, IS = 6.5 cm,
∠M = 75°, ∠I = 105° and ∠S = 120°.
PRACTICAL GEOMETRY  63
Solution:
Here is a rough sketch that would help us in deciding our steps of
construction. We give only hints for various steps (Fig 4.15).
Step 1
How do you locate the points? What choice do you make for the base and what
is the first step? (Fig 4.16)

4.2.4 When three sides and two included angles are given
Under this type, when you draw a rough sketch, note carefully the “included” angles
in particular.
Example 4: Construct a quadrilateral ABCD, where
AB = 4 cm, BC = 5 cm, CD = 6.5 cm and ∠B = 105° and
∠C = 80°.
Solution:
We draw a rough sketch, as usual, to get an idea of how we can
start off. Then we can devise a plan to locate the four points
(Fig 4.19).
Fig 4.19
Fig 4.20
Step 2
The fourth point D is on CY which is inclined at 80° to BC. So make ∠BCY = 80°
at C on BC (Fig 4.21).
Step 1
Start with taking BC = 5 cm on B. Draw an angle of 105° along BX. Locate A
4 cm away on this. We now have B, C and A (Fig 4.20).

Step 3
D is at a distance of 6.5 cm on CY. With
C as centre, draw an arc of length 6.5 cm.
It cuts CY at D (Fig 4.22).
1. In the above example, we first drew BC. Instead, what could have been be the
other starting points?
2. We used some five measurements to draw quadrilaterals so far. Can there be
different sets of five measurements (other than seen so far) to draw a quadrilateral?
The following problems may help you in answering the question.
(i) Quadrilateral ABCD with AB = 5 cm, BC = 5.5 cm, CD = 4 cm, AD = 6 cm
and ∠B = 80°.
(ii) Quadrilateral PQRS with PQ = 4.5 cm, ∠P = 70°, ∠Q = 100°, ∠R = 80°
and ∠S = 110°.

data for construction of a quadrilateral.

∠A = 90°
∠U = 120°
4.3  Some Special Cases
To draw a quadrilateral, we used 5 measurements in our work. Is there any quadrilateral
which can be drawn with less number of available measurements? The following examples
examine such special cases.
Example 5: Draw a square of side 4.5 cm.
Solution: Initially it appears that only one measurement has been given. Actually
we have many more details with us, because the figure is a special quadrilateral,
namely a square. We now know that each of its angles is a right angle. (See the
rough figure) (Fig 4.24)
This enables us to draw Δ ABC using SAS condition. Then D can be easily
located. Try yourself now to draw the square with the given measurements.
Example 6: Is it possible to construct a rhombus ABCD where AC = 6 cm
and BD = 7 cm? Justify your answer.
Solution: Only two (diagonal) measurements of the rhombus are given. However,
since it is a rhombus, we can find more help from its properties.
The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors
of one another.
So, first draw AC = 7 cm and then construct its perpendicular bisector.
Let them meet at 0. Cut off 3 cm lengths on either side of the drawn
bisector. You now get B and D.
Draw the rhombus now, based on the method described above
(Fig 4.25).

only the lengths PQ and QR?

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Five measurements can determine a quadrilateral uniquely.
2. A quadrilateral can be constructed uniquely if the lengths of its four sides and a diagonal is given.
3. A quadrilateral can be constructed uniquely if its two diagonals and three sides are known.
4. A quadrilateral can be constructed uniquely if its two adjacent sides and three angles are known.
5. A quadrilateral can be constructed uniquely if its three sides and two included angles are given.
DATA HANDLING  69
5.1  Looking for Information
In your day-to-day life, you might have come across information, such as:
(a) Runs made by a batsman in the last 10 test matches.
(b) Number of wickets taken by a bowler in the last 10 ODIs.
(c) Marks scored by the students of your class in the Mathematics unit test.
(d) Number of story books read by each of your friends etc.
The information collected in all such cases is called data. Data is usually collected in
the context of a situation that we want to study. For example, a teacher may like to know
the average height of students in her class. To find this, she will write the heights of all the
students in her class, organise the data in a systematic manner and then interpret it
accordingly.
Sometimes, data is represented graphically to give a clear idea of what it represents.
Do you remember the different types of graphs which we have learnt in earlier classes?

5.2  Organising Data
Usually, data available to us is in an unorganised form called raw data. To draw meaningful
inferences, we need to organise the data systematically. For example, a group of students
was asked for their favourite subject. The results were as listed below:
Art, Mathematics, Science, English, Mathematics, Art, English, Mathematics, English,
Art, Science, Art, Science, Science, Mathematics, Art, English, Art, Science, Mathematics,
Science, Art.
Which is the most liked subject and the one least liked?
MATHEMATICS
TRY THESE
It is not easy to answer the question looking at the choices written haphazardly. We
arrange the data in Table 5.1 using tally marks.
Table 5.1

The number of tallies before each subject gives the number of students who like that
particular subject.
This is known as the frequency of that subject.
Frequency gives the number of times that a particular entry occurs.
From Table 5.1, Frequency of students who like English is 4
Frequency of students who like Mathematics is 5
The table made is known as frequency distribution table as it gives the number
of times an entry occurs.
1. A group of students were asked to say which animal they would like most to have

Make a frequency distribution table for the same.
5.3  Grouping Data
The data regarding choice of subjects showed the occurrence of each of the entries several
times. For example, Art is liked by 7 students, Mathematics is liked by 5 students and so
on (Table 5.1). This information can be displayed graphically using a pictograph or a
bargraph. Sometimes, however, we have to deal with a large data. For example, consider
the following marks (out of 50) obtained in Mathematics by 60 students of Class VIII:
21, 10, 30, 22, 33, 5, 37, 12, 25, 42, 15, 39, 26, 32, 18, 27, 28, 19, 29, 35, 31, 24,
36, 18, 20, 38, 22, 44, 16, 24, 10, 27, 39, 28, 49, 29, 32, 23, 31, 21, 34, 22, 23, 36, 24,
36, 33, 47, 48, 50, 39, 20, 7, 16, 36, 45, 47, 30, 22, 17.
If we make a frequency distribution table for each observation, then the table would
be too long, so, for convenience, we make groups of observations say, 0-10, 10-20 and
so on, and obtain a frequency distribution of the number of observations falling in each

group. Thus, the frequency distribution table for the above data can be.

Data presented in this manner is said to be grouped and the distribution obtained is called
grouped frequency  distribution. It helps us to draw meaningful inferences like –
(1) Most of the students have scored between 20 and 40.
(2) Eight students have scored more than 40 marks out of 50 and so on.
Each of the groups 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc., is called a Class Interval (or briefly
a class).
Observe that 10 occurs in both the classes, i.e., 0-10 as well as 10-20. Similarly, 20
occurs in classes 10-20 and 20-30. But it is not possible that an observation (say 10 or 20)
can belong simultaneously to two classes. To avoid this, we adopt the convention that the
common observation will belong to the higher class, i.e.,  10 belongs to the class interval
10-20 (and not to 0-10). Similarly, 20 belongs to 20-30 (and not to 10-20). In the class
interval, 10-20, 10 is called the lower class limit and 20 is called the upper class limit.
Similarly, in the class interval 20-30, 20 is the lower class limit and 30 is the upper class limit.
Observe that the difference between the upper class limit and lower class limit for each of the
class intervals 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 etc., is equal, (10 in this case). This difference between
the upper class limit and lower class limit is called the width or size of the class interval.

5.4  Circle Graph or Pie Chart
Have you ever come across data represented in circular form as shown (Fig 5.4)?
The time spent by a child during a day
Age groups of people in a town
These are called circle graphs. A circle graph shows the relationship between a
whole and its parts. Here, the whole circle is divided into sectors. The size of each sector
is proportional to the activity or information it represents.
For example, in the above graph, the proportion of the sector for hours spent in sleeping
= number of sleeping hours
whole day
= 8 hours
24 hours
So, this sector is drawn as 1 rd
part of the circle. Similarly, the proportion of the sector
for hours  spent in school = number of school hours
whole day
= 6 hours
24 hours
Fig 5.4
MATHEMATICS
So this sector is drawn 1 th
of  the circle. Similarly, the size of other sectors can be found.
Add up the fractions for all the activities. Do you get the total as one?
A circle graph is also called a pie chart.

5.5  Chance and Probability
Sometimes it happens that during rainy season, you carry a raincoat every day
and it does not rain for many days. However, by chance, one day you forget to
take the raincoat and it rains heavily on that day.
Sometimes it so happens that a student prepares 4 chapters out of 5, very well
for a test. But a major question is asked from the chapter that she left unprepared.
Everyone knows that a particular train runs in time but the day you reach
well in time it is late!
You face a lot of situations such as these where you take a chance and it
does not go the way you want it to. Can you give some more examples? These
are examples where the chances of a certain thing happening or not happening
are not equal. The chances of the train being in time or being late are not the
same. When you buy a ticket which is wait listed, you do take a chance. You
hope that it might get confirmed by the time you travel.
We however, consider here certain experiments whose results have an equal chance
of occurring.
5.5.1  Getting a result
You might have seen that before a cricket match starts, captains of the two teams go out
to toss a coin to decide which team will bat first.
What are the possible results you get when a coin is tossed? Of course, Head or Tail.
Imagine that you are the captain of one team and your friend is the captain of the other
team. You toss a coin and ask your friend to make the call. Can you control the result of
the toss? Can you get a head if you want one? Or a tail if you want that? No, that is not
possible. Such an experiment is called a random experiment. Head or Tail are the two
outcomes of this experiment.
1. If you try to start a scooter, what are the possible outcomes?
2. When a die is thrown, what are the six possible outcomes?
raincoat.
MATHEMATICS
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
3. When you spin the wheel shown, what are the possible outcomes? (Fig 5.9)
List them.
(Outcome here means the sector at which the pointer stops).
4. You have a bag with five identical balls of different colours and you are to pull out
(draw) a ball without looking at it; list the outcomes you would
get (Fig 5.10).
In throwing a die:
• Does the first player have a greater chance of getting a six?
• Would the player who played after him have a lesser chance of getting a six?
• Suppose the second player got a six. Does it mean that the third player would not
have a chance of getting a six?
5.5.2  Equally likely outcomes:
A coin is tossed several times and the number of times we get head or tail is noted. Let us
look at the result sheet where we keep on increasing the tosses:
Fig 5.10
Fig 5.9

Tally marks (H)

DATA HANDLING  85
Observe that as you increase the number of tosses more and more, the number of
heads and the number of tails come closer and closer to each other.
This could also be done with a die, when tossed a large number of times. Number of
each of the six outcomes become almost equal  to each other.
In such cases, we may say that the different outcomes of the experiment are equally
likely. This means that each of the outcomes has the same chance of occurring.
5.5.3  Linking chances to probability
Consider the experiment of tossing a coin once. What are the outcomes? There are only
two outcomes – Head or Tail. Both the outcomes are equally likely. Likelihood of getting
a head is one out of two outcomes, i.e., 1
2 . In other words, we say that the probability of
getting a head = 1
2 . What is the probability of getting a tail?
Now take the example of throwing a die marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on its faces (one
number on one face). If you throw it once, what are the outcomes?
The outcomes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Thus, there are six equally likely outcomes.
What is the probability of getting the outcome ‘2’?
It is
What is the probability of getting the number 5? What is the probability of getting the
number 7? What is the probability of getting a number 1 through 6?
5.5.4  Outcomes as events
Each outcome of an experiment or a collection of outcomes make an event.
For example in the experiment of tossing a coin, getting a Head is an event and getting a
Tail is also an event.
In case of throwing a die, getting each of the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is an event.
←   Number of outcomes giving 2
←   Number of equally likely outcomes.
MATHEMATICS
TRY THESE
Is getting an even number an event? Since an even number could be 2, 4 or 6, getting an
even number is also an event. What will be the probability of getting an even number?
It is
Example 3: A bag has 4 red balls and 2 yellow balls. (The balls are identical in all
respects other than colour). A ball is drawn from the bag without looking into the bag.
What is probability of getting a red ball? Is it more or less than getting a yellow ball?
Solution:  There are in all (4 + 2 =) 6 outcomes of  the event. Getting a red ball
consists of 4 outcomes. (Why?)
Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is 4
6 = 2
3 . In the same way the probability
of getting a yellow ball = 2
(Why?). Therefore, the probability of getting a red ball is
more than that of getting a yellow ball.
Suppose you spin the wheel

List the number of outcomes of getting a green sector
and not getting a green sector on this wheel
(Fig 5.11).
Find the probability of getting a green sector.
(iii)
Find the probability of not getting a green sector.
5.5.5  Chance and probability related to real life
We talked about the chance that it rains just on the day when we do not carry a rain coat.
What could you say about the chance in terms of probability? Could it be one in 10
days during a rainy season? The probability that it rains is then 1
10 . The probability that it
does not rain = 9
10 . (Assuming raining or not raining on a day are equally likely)
The use of probability is made in various cases in real life.
1. To find characteristics of a large group by using a small
part of the group.
For example, during elections ‘an exit poll’ is taken.
This involves asking the people whom they have voted
for, when they come out after voting at the centres
which are chosen off  hand and distributed over the
whole area. This gives an idea of chance of winning of
each candidate and predictions are made based on it
accordingly.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Data mostly available to us in an unorganised form is called raw data.
2. In order to draw meaningful inferences from any data, we need to organise the data systematically.
MATHEMATICS
3. Frequency gives the number of times that a particular entry occurs.
4. Raw data can be ‘grouped’ and presented systematically through ‘grouped frequency distribution’.
5. Grouped data can be presented using histogram. Histogram is a type of bar diagram, where the
class intervals are shown on the horizontal axis and the heights of the bars show the frequency of
the class interval. Also, there is no gap between the bars as there is no gap between the class
intervals.

SQUARES AND SQUARE ROOTS   89
6.1  Introduction
You know that the area of a square = side × side (where ‘side’  means ‘the length of
a side’). Study the following table.
Side of a square (in cm)
Area of the square (in cm2)
1 × 1 = 1 = 12
2 × 2 = 4 = 22
3 × 3 = 9 = 32
5 × 5 = 25 = 52
8 × 8 = 64 = 82
a × a = a2
What is special about the numbers 4, 9, 25, 64 and other such numbers?
Since, 4 can be expressed as 2 × 2 = 22, 9 can be expressed as 3 × 3 = 32, all such
numbers can be expressed as the product of the number with itself.
Such numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... are known as square numbers.
In general, if a natural number m can be expressed as n2, where n is also a natural
number, then m is a square number. Is 32 a square number?
We know that 52 = 25 and 62 = 36. If 32 is a square number, it must be the square of
a natural number  between 5 and 6. But there is no natural number between 5 and 6.
Therefore 32 is not a square number.

If we combine two consecutive triangular numbers, we get a square number, like
1 + 3 = 4
3 + 6 = 9
6 + 10 = 16
2. Numbers between square numbers
Let us now see if we can find some interesting pattern between two consecutive
square numbers.
1 (= 12)
2, 3, 4 (= 22)
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (= 32)
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (= 42)
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (= 52)
Between 12(=1) and 22(= 4) there are two (i.e., 2 × 1) non square numbers 2, 3.
Between 22(= 4) and 32(= 9) there are four (i.e., 2 × 2) non square numbers 5, 6, 7, 8.
32 = 9,       42 = 16
Therefore,
42 – 32 = 16 – 9 = 7
Between 9(=32) and 16(= 42) the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 that is, six
non-square numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.
We have
42 = 16     and     52 = 25
Therefore,
52 – 42 = 9
Between 16(= 42) and 25(= 52) the numbers are 17, 18, ... , 24 that is, eight non square
numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.
Consider 72 and 62. Can you say how many numbers are there between 62 and 72?
If we think of any natural number n and (n + 1), then,
(n + 1)2 – n2 = (n2 + 2n + 1) – n2 = 2n + 1.
We find that between n2 and (n + 1)2 there are 2n numbers which is 1 less than the
difference of two squares.
Thus, in general we can say that there are 2n non perfect square numbers between
the squares of the numbers n and (n + 1). Check for n = 5, n = 6 etc., and verify.
Two non square numbers

numbers 1 (=12) and 4(=22).

(ii) 902 and 912
(iii) 10002 and 10012
3. Adding odd numbers
Consider the following
1  [one odd number]
= 1 = 12
1 + 3  [sum of first two odd numbers]
= 4 = 22
1 + 3 + 5  [sum of first three odd numbers]
= 9 = 32
1 + 3 + 5 + 7  [... ]
= 16 = 42
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9  [... ]
= 25 = 52
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11  [... ]
= 36 = 62
So we can say that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is n2.
Looking at it in a different way, we can say: ‘If the number is a square number, it has
to be the sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1.
Consider those numbers which are not perfect squares, say 2, 3, 5, 6, ... . Can you
express these numbers as a sum of successive odd natural numbers beginning from 1?
You will find that these numbers cannot be expressed in this form.
Consider the number 25. Successively subtract 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... from it
(i) 25 – 1 = 24
(ii) 24 – 3 = 21
(iii) 21 – 5 = 16
(iv) 16 – 7 = 9
(v) 9 – 9 = 0
This means, 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9. Also, 25 is a perfect square.
Now consider another number 38, and again do as above.
(i) 38 – 1 = 37
(ii) 37 – 3 = 34
(iii) 34 – 5 = 29
(iv) 29 – 7 = 22
(v) 22 – 9 = 13
(vi) 13 – 11 = 2
(vii) 2 – 13 = – 11
This shows that we are not able to express 38 as the
sum of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1. Also, 38 is
not a perfect square.
So we can also say that if a natural number cannot be
expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers
starting with 1, then it is not a perfect square.
We can use this result to find whether a number is a perfect
square or not.

2. Do you think the reverse is also true, i.e., is the sum of any two consecutive positive
integers is perfect square of a number? Give example to support your answer.
5. Product of two consecutive even or odd natural numbers
11 × 13 = 143 = 122 – 1
11 × 13 = (12 – 1) × (12 + 1)
Therefore,
11 × 13 = (12 – 1) × (12 + 1) = 122 – 1
Similarly,
13 × 15 = (14 – 1) × (14 + 1) = 142 – 1
29 × 31 = (30 – 1) × (30 + 1) = 302 – 1
44 × 46 = (45 – 1) × (45 + 1) = 452 – 1
So in general we can say that (a + 1) × (a – 1) = a2 – 1.

6.4  Finding the Square of a Number
Squares of small numbers like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... etc. are easy to find. But can we find the
square of 23 so quickly?
The answer is not so easy and we may need to multiply 23 by 23.
There is a way to find this without having to multiply 23 × 23.
We know
23 = 20 + 3
Therefore
232 = (20 + 3)2 = 20(20 + 3) + 3(20 + 3)
= 202 + 20 × 3 + 3 × 20 + 32
= 400 + 60 + 60 + 9 = 529
Example 1: Find the square of the following numbers without actual multiplication.
(i) 39
(ii) 42
Solution: (i)
392 = (30 + 9)2 = 30(30 + 9) + 9(30 + 9)
= 302 + 30 × 9 + 9 × 30 + 92
= 900 + 270 + 270 + 81 = 1521
422 = (40 + 2)2 = 40(40 + 2) + 2(40 + 2)
= 402 + 40 × 2 + 2 × 40 + 22
= 1600 + 80 + 80 + 4 = 1764

6.4.2  Pythagorean triplets
Consider the following
32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52
The collection of numbers 3, 4 and 5 is known as Pythagorean triplet. 6, 8, 10 is
also a Pythagorean triplet, since
62 + 82 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 102
Again, observe that
52 + 122 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132. The numbers 5, 12, 13 form another such triplet.
Consider a number with unit digit 5, i.e., a5
(a5)2 = (10a + 5)2
= 10a(10a + 5) + 5(10a + 5)
= 100a2 + 50a + 50a + 25
= 100a(a + 1) + 25
= a(a + 1) hundred + 25
MATHEMATICS
Can you find more such triplets?
For any natural number m > 1, we have (2m)2 + (m2 – 1)2 = (m2 + 1)2. So, 2m,
m2 – 1 and m2 + 1 forms a Pythagorean triplet.
Try to find some more Pythagorean triplets using this form.
Example 2: Write a Pythagorean triplet whose smallest member is 8.
Solution: We can get Pythagorean triplets by using general form 2m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1.
Let us first take
m2 – 1 = 8
m2 = 8 + 1 = 9
which gives
m = 3
Therefore,
2m = 6   and    m2 + 1 = 10
The triplet is thus 6, 8, 10.  But 8 is not the smallest member of this.
So, let us try
2m = 8
m = 4
We get
m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15
m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17
The triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member.
Example 3: Find a Pythagorean triplet in which one member is 12.
Solution: If we take
m2 – 1 = 12
Then,
m2 = 12 + 1 = 13
Then the value of m will not be an integer.
So, we try to take m2 + 1 = 12. Again m2 = 11 will not give an integer value for m.
So, let us take
2m = 12
m = 6
Thus,
m2 – 1 = 36 – 1 = 35    and
m2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37
Therefore, the required triplet is 12, 35, 37.
Note: All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this form. For example another
triplet 5, 12, 13 also has 12 as a member.

6.5  Square Roots
Study the following situations.
(a) Area of a square is 144 cm2. What could be the side of the square?
SQUARES AND SQUARE ROOTS   99
We know that the area of a square = side2
If we assume the length of the side to be ‘a’, then 144 = a2
To find the length of side it is necessary to find a number whose square is 144.
(b) What is the length of a diagonal of a square of side 8 cm (Fig 6.1)?
Can we use Pythagoras theorem to solve this ?
We have,
AB2 + BC2 = AC2
i.e.,
82 + 82 = AC2
64 + 64 = AC2
128 = AC2
Again to get AC we need to think of a number whose square is 128.
(c) In a right triangle the length of the hypotenuse and a side are
respectively 5 cm and 3 cm (Fig 6.2).
Can you find the third side?
Let x cm be the length of the third side.
Using Pythagoras theorem
52 = x2 + 32
25 – 9 =  x2
16 = x2
Again, to find x we need a number whose square is 16.
In all the above cases, we need to find a number whose square is known. Finding the
number with the known square is known as finding the square root.
6.5.1  Finding square roots
The inverse (opposite) operation of addition is subtraction and the inverse operation
of multiplication is division. Similarly, finding the square root is the inverse operation
of squaring.

number. In this chapter, we shall take up only positive square root of a natural number.

6.5.2  Finding square root through repeated subtraction
Do you remember that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n2? That is, every square
number can be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting from 1.
Consider 81. Then,
(i) 81 – 1 = 80
(ii) 80 – 3 = 77
(iii)
77 – 5 = 72
(iv) 72 – 7 = 65

(vii)
45 – 13 = 32
(viii) 32 – 15 = 17
(ix) 17 – 17 = 0
From 81 we have subtracted successive odd
numbers starting from 1 and obtained 0 at 9th step.
Therefore 81 = 9.
Can you find the square root of 729 using this method?
Yes, but it will be time consuming. Let us try to find it in
a simpler way.
6.5.3  Finding square root through prime factorisation
Consider the prime factorisation of the following numbers and their squares.
Prime factorisation of a Number
Prime factorisation of its Square
6 = 2 × 3
36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
8 =  2 × 2 × 2
64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
12 = 2 × 2 × 3
144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
15 = 3 × 5
225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5
How many times does 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 6? Once. How many times
does 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 36? Twice. Similarly, observe the occurrence of
3 in 6 and 36 of 2 in 8 and 64 etc.
You will find that each prime factor in the prime factorisation of the
square of a number, occurs twice the number of times it occurs in the
prime factorisation of the number itself. Let us use this to find the square
root of a given square number, say 324.
We know that the prime factorisation of 324 is
324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3
TRY THESE

By pairing the prime factors, we get
324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3  = 22 × 32 × 32 = (2 × 3 × 3)2
324 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 18
Similarly can you find the square root of 256? Prime factorisation of 256 is
256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
By pairing the prime factors we get,
256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)2
Therefore,
256  =  2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16
Is 48 a perfect square?
We know
48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3
Since all the factors are not in pairs so 48 is not a perfect square.
Suppose we want to find the smallest multiple of 48 that is a perfect square, how
should we proceed? Making pairs of the prime factors of 48 we see that 3 is the only
factor that does not have a pair. So we need to multiply by 3 to complete the pair.
Hence
48 × 3 = 144 is a perfect square.
Can you tell by which number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square?
The factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3 we get 48 ÷ 3 = 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
and this number 16 is a perfect square too.
Example 4: Find the square root of 6400.
Solution: Write 6400 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5
Therefore
6400  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80
Example 5: Is 90 a perfect square?
Solution: We have 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5
The prime factors 2 and 5 do not occur in pairs. Therefore, 90 is not a perfect square.
That 90 is not a perfect square can also be seen from the fact that  it has only one zero.
Example 6: Is 2352 a perfect square? If not, find the smallest multiple of 2352 which
is a perfect square. Find the square root of the new number.
Solution: We have 2352 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7
As the prime factor 3 has no pair, 2352 is not a perfect square.
If 3 gets a pair then the number will become perfect square. So, we multiply 2352 by 3 to get,
2352 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7
Now each prime factor is in a pair. Therefore, 2352 × 3 = 7056   is a perfect square.
Thus the required smallest multiple of 2352 is 7056 which is a perfect square.
7056  = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84
Example 7: Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be divided so that the
quotient is a perfect square. Find the square root of the quotient.
MATHEMATICS
Solution: We have, 9408 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7
If we divide 9408 by the factor 3, then
9408 ÷ 3 = 3136 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7  which is a perfect square. (Why?)
Therefore, the required smallest number is 3.
3136  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.
Example 8:  Find the smallest square number which is divisible by each of the numbers
6, 9 and 15.
Solution: This has to be done in two steps. First find the smallest common multiple and
then find the square number needed. The least number divisible by each one of 6, 9 and
15 is their LCM. The LCM of 6, 9 and 15 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90.
Prime factorisation of 90 is 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5.
We see that prime factors 2 and 5 are not in pairs. Therefore 90 is not a perfect
square.
In order to get a perfect square, each factor of 90 must be paired. So we need to
make pairs of 2 and 5. Therefore, 90 should be multiplied by 2 × 5, i.e., 10.
Hence, the required square number is 90 × 10 = 900.

6.5.4  Finding square root by division method
When the numbers are large, even the method of finding square root by prime factorisation
becomes lengthy and difficult. To overcome this problem we use Long Division Method.
For this we need to determine the number of digits in the square root.
See the following table:
Number
Square
which is the smallest 3-digit perfect square
which is the greatest 3-digit perfect square
which is the smallest 4-digit perfect square
which is the greatest 4-digit perfect square
So, what can we say about the number of digits in the square root if a perfect
square is a 3-digit or a 4-digit number? We can say that, if a perfect square is a
3-digit or a 4-digit number, then its square root will have 2-digits.
Can you tell the number of digits in the square root of a 5-digit or a 6-digit
perfect square?
The smallest 3-digit perfect square number is 100 which is the square of 10 and the
greatest 3-digit perfect square number is 961 which is the square of 31. The smallest
4-digit square number is 1024 which is the square of 32 and the greatest 4-digit number is
9801 which is the square of 99.
Can we say that if a perfect square is of n-digits, then its square root will have 2
digits if n is even or (
if n is odd?
The use of the number of digits in square root of a number is useful in the following method:
• Consider the following steps to find the square root of 529.
Can you estimate the number of digits in the square root of this number?
Step 1
Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the digit at one’s place. If the
number of digits in it is odd, then the left-most single digit too will have a bar.
Thus we have, 529 .
Step 2
Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under the
extreme left bar (22 < 5 < 32). Take this number as the divisor and the quotient
with the number under the extreme left bar as the dividend (here 5). Divide and
get the remainder (1 in this case).
MATHEMATICS
Step 3
Bring down the number under the next bar (i.e., 29 in this case) to the right of
the remainder. So the new dividend is 129.
Step 4
Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.
Step 5
Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which will also become the new
digit in the quotient, such that when the new divisor is multiplied to the new
quotient the product is less than or equal to the dividend.
In this case 42 × 2 = 84.
As 43 × 3 = 129 so we choose the new digit as 3. Get the remainder.
Step 6
Since the remainder is 0 and no digits are left in the given number, therefore,
529  = 23.
• Now consider 4096
Step 1
Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the one’s digit. (40 96).
Step 2
Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under
the left-most bar (62 < 40 < 72). Take this number as the divisor and the number
under the left-most bar as the dividend. Divide and get the remainder i.e., 4 in
this case.
Step 3
Bring down the number under the next bar  (i.e., 96) to the right of the remainder.
The new dividend is 496.
Step 4
Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.
Step 5
Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which also becomes the new digit in the
quotient such that when the new digit is multiplied to the new quotient the product is
less than or equal to the dividend. In this case we see that 124 × 4 = 496.
So the new digit in the quotient is 4. Get the remainder.
Step 6
Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore, 4096  = 64.
Estimating the number
We use bars to find the number of digits in the square root of a perfect square number.
529  = 23          and
4096 = 64
In both the numbers 529 and 4096 there are two bars and the number of digits in their
square root is 2. Can you tell the number of digits in the square root of 14400?
By placing bars we get 14400. Since there are 3 bars, the square root will be of 3 digit.

(ii) 100000000

Example 9: Find the square root of : (i) 729
(ii) 1296
Solution:
Example 10: Find the least number that must be subtracted from 5607 so as to get
a perfect square. Also find the square root of the perfect square.
Solution: Let us try to find
5607  by long division method. We get the
remainder 131. It shows that 742 is less than 5607 by 131.
This means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.
Therefore, the required perfect square is 5607 – 131 = 5476.  And, 5476  =  74.
Example 11: Find the greatest 4-digit number which is a perfect square.
Solution: Greatest number of 4-digits = 9999. We find 9999  by long division
method. The remainder is 198. This shows 992 is less than 9999 by 198.
This means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.
Therefore, the required perfect square is 9999 – 198 = 9801.
And,  9801 = 99
Example 12: Find the least number that must be added to 1300 so as to get a
perfect square. Also find the square root of the perfect square.
Solution: We find 1300  by long division method. The remainder is 4.
This shows that 362 < 1300.
Next perfect square number is 372 = 1369.
Hence, the number to be added is 372 – 1300 = 1369 – 1300 = 69.
6.6  Square Roots of Decimals
Consider 17.64
Step 1
To find the square root of a decimal number we put bars on the integral part
(i.e., 17) of the number in the usual manner. And place bars on the decimal part
Therefore

(i.e., 64) on every pair of digits beginning with the first decimal place. Proceed
as usual. We get 17.64.
Step 2
Now proceed in a similar manner. The left most bar is on 17 and 42 < 17 < 52.
Take this number as the divisor and the number under the left-most bar as the
dividend, i.e., 17. Divide and get the remainder.
Step 3
The remainder is 1. Write the number under the next bar (i.e., 64) to the right of
this remainder, to get 164.
Step 4
Double the divisor and enter it with a blank on its right.
Since 64 is the decimal part so put a decimal point in the
quotient.
Step 5
We know 82 × 2 = 164, therefore, the new digit is 2.
Divide and get the remainder.
Step 6
Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore 17.64
Example 13: Find the square root of 12.25.
Solution:
Which way to move
Consider a number 176.341. Put bars on both integral part and decimal part. In what way
is putting bars on decimal part different from integral part? Notice for 176 we start from
the unit’s place close to the decimal and move towards left. The first bar is over 76 and the
second bar over 1. For .341, we start from the decimal and move towards right. First bar
is over 34 and for the second bar we put 0 after 1 and make .3410 .
Example 14: Area of a square plot is 2304 m2. Find the side of the square plot.
Solution: Area of square plot = 2304 m2
Therefore,
side of the square plot =
2304 m
We find that,
2304  = 48
Thus, the side of the square plot is 48 m.
Example 15: There are 2401 students in a school. P.T. teacher wants them to stand

So, the number of columns = x
Therefore, number of students = x × x = x2

The number of rows = 49.
6.7 Estimating Square Root
Consider the following situations:
1. Deveshi has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2. She wants to know whether
she can make a handkerchief of side 15 cm. If that is not possible she wants to
know what is the maximum length of the side of a handkerchief that can be made
from this piece.
2. Meena and Shobha played a game. One told a number and other gave its square
root. Meena started first. She said 25 and Shobha answered quickly as 5. Then
Shobha said 81 and Meena answered 9. It went on, till at one point Meena gave the
number 250. And Shobha could not answer. Then Meena asked Shobha if she
could atleast tell a number whose square is closer to 250.
In all such cases we need to estimate the square root.
We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100  = 10 and
400  = 20.
250  < 20
But still we are not very close to the square number.
We know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256
Therefore,
15 < 250  < 16 and 256 is much closer to 250 than 225.
250  is approximately 16.

7.1  Introduction
This is a story about one of  India’s great mathematical geniuses, S. Ramanujan. Once
another famous mathematician Prof. G.H. Hardy came to visit him in a taxi whose number
was 1729. While talking to Ramanujan, Hardy described this number
“a dull number”. Ramanujan quickly pointed out that 1729 was indeed
interesting. He said it is the smallest  number that can be expressed
as a sum of two cubes in two different ways:
1729 = 1728 + 1 = 123 + 13
1729 = 1000 + 729 = 103 + 93
1729 has since been known as the Hardy – Ramanujan Number,
even though this feature of 1729 was known more than 300 years
before Ramanujan.
How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All
through his life, he experimented with numbers. He probably found
numbers that were expressed as the sum of two squares and sum of
two cubes also.
There are many other interesting patterns of cubes. Let us learn about cubes, cube
roots and many other interesting facts related to them.
7.2  Cubes
You know that the word ‘cube’ is used in geometry. A cube is
a solid figure which has all its sides equal. How many cubes of
side 1 cm will make a cube of side 2 cm?
How many cubes of side 1 cm will make a cube of side 3 cm?
Consider the numbers 1, 8, 27, ...
These are called perfect cubes or cube numbers. Can you say why
they are named so? Each of them is obtained when a number is multiplied by
itself three times.

Figures which have
3-dimensions are known as
solid figures.
110  MATHEMATICS
The numbers 729, 1000, 1728
are also perfect cubes.
We note that 1 = 1 × 1 × 1 = 13;  8 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 23; 27 = 3 × 3 × 3 = 33.
Since 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125, therefore 125 is a cube number.
Is 9 a cube number? No, as 9 = 3 × 3 and there is no natural number which multiplied
by itself three times gives 9. We can see also that 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 and 3 × 3 × 3 = 27. This
shows that 9 is not a perfect cube.
The following are the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10.

Observe that each prime factor of a number appears
three times in the prime factorisation of its cube.
In the prime factorisation of any number, if each factor
appears three times, then, is the number a perfect cube?
Think about it. Is 216 a perfect cube?
By prime factorisation, 216 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3
Each factor appears 3 times. 216 = 23 × 33 = (2 × 3)3
= 63   which is a perfect cube!
Is 729 a perfect cube?
729 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3
Yes, 729 is a perfect cube.
Now let us check for 500.
Prime factorisation of 500 is 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5.
So, 500 is not a perfect cube.
Example 1: Is 243 a perfect cube?
Solution: 243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3
In the above factorisation 3 × 3 remains after grouping the 3’s in triplets. Therefore, 243 is
not a perfect cube.
Which of the following are perfect cubes?
1. 400
2. 3375
3. 8000
4. 15625
5. 9000

7.2.2  Smallest multiple that is a perfect cube
Raj made a cuboid of plasticine. Length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 cm,
30 cm, 15 cm respectively.
Anu asks how many such cuboids will she need to make a perfect cube? Can you tell?
Raj said, Volume of cuboid is 15 × 30 × 15  = 3 × 5 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 3 × 5
= 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5
Since there is only one 2 in the prime factorisation. So we need 2 × 2, i.e., 4 to make
it a perfect cube. Therefore, we need 4 such cuboids to make a cube.
Example 2: Is 392 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest natural number by which
392 must be multiplied so that the product is a perfect cube.
Solution: 392 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7
The prime factor 7 does not appear in a group of three. Therefore, 392 is not a perfect
cube. To make its a cube, we need one more 7. In that case
392 × 7 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 2744           which is a perfect cube.
factors can be

There are three
5’s in the product but
only two 2’s.
Do you remember that
am × bm = (a × b)m
CUBES AND CUBE ROOTS  113
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
Hence the smallest natural number by which 392 should be multiplied to make a perfect
cube is 7.
Example 3: Is 53240 a perfect cube? If not, then by which smallest natural number
should 53240 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube?
Solution: 53240 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 11 × 11 × 5
The prime factor 5 does not appear in a group of three. So, 53240 is not a perfect cube.
In the factorisation 5 appears only one time. If we divide the number by 5, then the prime
factorisation of the quotient will not contain 5.
53240 ÷ 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 11 × 11 × 11
Hence the smallest number by which 53240 should be divided to make it a perfect
cube is 5.
The perfect cube in that case is = 10648.
Example 4: Is 1188 a perfect cube? If not, by which smallest natural number should
1188 be divided so that the quotient is a perfect cube?
Solution: 1188 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 11
The primes 2 and 11 do not appear in groups of three. So, 1188 is not a perfect cube. In
the factorisation of 1188 the prime 2 appears only two times and the prime 11 appears
once. So, if we divide 1188 by 2 × 2 × 11 = 44, then the prime factorisation of the
quotient will not contain 2 and 11.
Hence the smallest natural number by which 1188 should be divided to make it a
perfect cube is 44.
And the resulting perfect cube is 1188 ÷ 44 = 27 (=33).
Example 5: Is 68600 a perfect cube? If not, find the smallest number by which 68600
must be multiplied to get a perfect cube.
Solution: We have, 68600 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7. In this factorisation, we
find that there is no triplet of 5.
So, 68600 is not a perfect cube. To make it  a perfect cube we multiply it by 5.
Thus,
68600 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 7 × 7 × 7
= 343000,   which is a perfect cube.
Observe that 343 is a perfect cube. From Example 5 we know that 343000 is also
perfect cube.
Check which of the following are perfect cubes. (i) 2700 (ii) 16000 (iii) 64000
(iv) 900 (v) 125000 (vi) 36000 (vii) 21600 (viii) 10,000 (ix) 27000000 (x) 1000.

7.3  Cube Roots
If the volume of a cube is 125 cm3, what would be the length of its side? To get the length
of the side of the cube, we need to know a number whose cube is 125.
Finding the square root, as you know, is the inverse operation of squaring. Similarly,
finding the cube root is the inverse operation of finding cube.
We know that 23 = 8; so we say that the cube root of 8 is 2.
We write 3 8  = 2. The symbol 3
denotes ‘cube-root.’

7.3.1  Cube root through prime factorisation method
Consider 3375. We find its cube root by prime factorisation:
3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 33 × 53 = (3 × 5)3
Therefore,
cube root of 3375 = 3 3375 = 3 × 5 = 15
Similarly, to find 3 74088 , we have,

Example 7: Find the cube root of 13824 by prime factorisation method.
Solution:
13824 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 23 × 23 × 33.

7.3.2 Cube root of a cube number
If you know that the given number is a cube number then following method can be used.
Step 1
Take any cube number say 857375 and start making groups of three digits
starting from the right most digit of the number.
second group
first group
We can estimate the cube root of a given cube number through a step by
step process.
We get 375 and 857 as two groups of three digits each.
Step 2
First group, i.e., 375 will give you the one’s (or unit’s) digit of the required
cube root.
The number 375 ends with 5. We know that 5 comes at the unit’s place of a
number only when it’s cube root ends in 5.
So, we get 5 at the unit’s place of the cube root.
Step 3
Now take another group, i.e., 857.
We know that 93 = 729 and 103 = 1000. Also, 729 < 857 < 1000. We take
the one’s place, of the smaller number 729 as the ten’s place of the required
cube root. So, we get 3 857375
Example 8: Find the cube root of 17576 through estimation.
Solution: The given number is 17576.
Step 1

17  576. In this case one group i.e., 576 has three digits whereas 17 has only
two digits.
Step 2
Take 576.
The digit 6 is at its one’s place.
We take the one’s place of the required cube root as 6.

8.1  Recalling Ratios and Percentages
We know, ratio means comparing two quantities.
A basket has two types of fruits, say, 20 apples and 5 oranges.
Then, the ratio of the number of oranges to the number of apples = 5 : 20.
The comparison can be done by using fractions as, 5
20  = 1
The number of oranges are 1
4 th the number of apples. In terms of ratio, this is
1 : 4, read as, “1 is to 4”
Number of apples to number of oranges = 20
which means, the number of apples
are  4 times the number of oranges. This comparison can also be done using percentages.
There are 5 oranges out of 25 fruits.
So percentage of oranges is
[Denominator made 100].
Since
contains only apples and oranges,
percentage of apples + percentage of oranges = 100
percentage of apples + 20 = 100
percentage of apples = 100 – 20 = 80
Thus the basket has 20% oranges and 80% apples.
Example 1: A picnic is being planned in a school for Class VII. Girls are 60% of the
total number of students and are 18 in number.
The picnic site is 55 km from the school and the transport company is charging at the rate
of ` 12 per km. The total cost of refreshments will be ` 4280.

CHAPTER8
By unitary method:
Out of 25 fruits, number of oranges are 5.
So out of 100 fruits, number of oranges
= 20.
MATHEMATICS
Can you tell.
1. The ratio of the number of girls to the number of boys in the class?
2. The cost per head if two teachers are also going with the class?
3. If their first stop is at a place 22 km from the school, what per cent of the total
distance of 55 km is this? What per cent of the distance is left to be covered?
Solution:
1. To find the ratio of girls to boys.
Ashima and John came up with the following answers.
They needed to know the number of boys and also the total number of students.
Ashima did this
John used the unitary method
Let the total number of students
There are 60 girls out of 100 students.
be x. 60% of x is girls.
There is one girl out of
60  students.
Therefore, 60% of x = 18
So, 18 girls are out of  how many students?
=  18
Number of students = 100
or,  x = 18
Number of students = 30.
So, the number of boys = 30 – 18 = 12.
Hence, ratio of the number of girls to the number of boys is 18 : 12 or 18
12  = 3
2  is written as 3 : 2 and read as 3 is to 2.
2. To find the cost per person.
Transportation charge = Distance both ways × Rate
= ` (55 × 2) × 12
= ` 110 × 12 = ` 1320
Total expenses = Refreshment charge
+ Transportation charge
= ` 4280 + ` 1320
= ` 5600
Total number of persons =18 girls + 12 boys + 2 teachers
= 32 persons
Ashima and John then used unitary method to find the cost per head.
For 32 persons, amount spent would be ` 5600.
The amount spent for 1 person = ` 5600
= ` 175.
3. The distance of the place where first stop was made = 22 km.
COMPARING QUANTITIES  119
To find the percentage of distance:
Ashima used this method:
John used the unitary method:
Out of 55 km, 22 km are travelled.
Out of 1 km, 22
55 km are travelled.
Out of 100 km, 22
55  × 100 km are travelled.
That is 40% of the total distance is travelled.
She is multiplying
the ratio by
and converting to
percentage.
TRY THESE
Both came out with the same answer that the distance from their school of the place where
they stopped at was 40% of the total distance they had to travel.
Therefore, the percent distance left to be travelled = 100% – 40% = 60%.

8.2 Finding the Increase or Decrease Per cent
We often come across such information in our daily life as.
(i) 25% off on marked  prices
(ii) 10% hike in the price of petrol
Let us consider a few such examples.
Example 2:  The price of a scooter was ` 34,000 last year. It has  increased by 20%
this year. What is the price now?
Solution:
Amita said that she would first find
the increase in the price, which is 20% of
` 34,000, and then find the new price.
20% of ` 34000 = ` 20
34000
= ` 6800
New price  = Old price + Increase
= ` 34,000 + ` 6,800
= ` 40,800
Similarly, a percentage decrease in price would imply finding the actual decrease
followed by its subtraction the from original price.
Suppose in order to increase its sale, the price of scooter was decreased by 5%.
Then let us find the price of scooter.
Price of scooter  = ` 34000
Reduction = 5% of ` 34000
= ` 5
34000
100 ×
= ` 1700
New price = Old price – Reduction
= ` 34000 – ` 1700 = ` 32300
We will also use this in the next section of the chapter.
8.3  Finding Discounts
Discount is a reduction given on the Marked Price
(MP) of the article.
This is generally given to attract customers to buy
goods or to promote sales of the goods. You can find
the discount by subtracting its sale price from its
marked price.
So, Discount = Marked price – Sale price
Sunita used the unitary method.
20% increase means,
` 100 increased to ` 120.
So, ` 34,000 will increase to?
Increased price = `
34000
= ` 40,800

Example 3: An item marked at ` 840 is sold for ` 714. What is the discount and
discount %?
Solution:
Discount = Marked Price – Sale Price
= ` 840 – ` 714
= ` 126
Since discount is on marked price, we will have to use marked price as the base.
On marked price of ` 840, the discount is ` 126.
On MP of ` 100, how much will the discount be?
Discount = 126
840 ×
= 15%
You can also find discount when discount % is given.
Example 4: The list price of a frock is ` 220.
A discount of 20% is announced on sales. What is the amount
of discount on it and its sale price.
Solution:  Marked price is same as the list price.
20% discount means that on ` 100 (MP), the discount is ` 20.
By unitary method, on `1 the discount will be ` 20
On ` 220,  discount = ` 20
100 ×
= ` 44
The sale price = (` 220 – ` 44) or  ` 176
Rehana found the sale price like this —
A discount of 20% means for a MP of ` 100, discount is ` 20. Hence the sale price is
` 80. Using unitary method, when MP is ` 100, sale price is ` 80;
When MP is ` 1, sale price is ` 80
100 .
Hence when MP is ` 220, sale price = ` 80
100 ×
= ` 176.
1. A shop gives 20% discount. What would the sale price of each of these be?
(a) A dress marked at ` 120
(b) A pair of shoes marked at ` 750
(c) A bag marked at ` 250
2. A table marked at ` 15,000 is available for ` 14,400. Find the discount  given and

8.3.1 Estimation in percentages
Your bill in a shop is ` 577.80 and the shopkeeper gives a discount of 15%. How would
you estimate the amount to be paid?
(i) Round off the bill to the nearest tens of ` 577.80, i.e., to ` 580.
(ii) Find 10% of this, i.e., ` 10
100 ×
(iii) Take half of this, i.e., 1
(iv) Add the amounts in (ii) and (iii) to get ` 87.
You could therefore reduce your bill amount by ` 87 or by about ` 85, which will be
` 495 approximately.
1. Try estimating 20% of the same bill amount.
2. Try finding 15% of ` 375.
8.4  Prices Related to Buying and Selling (Profit and Loss)
For the school fair (mela) I am going to put a stall of lucky dips. I will charge ` 10 for one
lucky dip but I will buy items which are worth ` 5.
So you are making a profit of 100%.
No, I will spend ` 3 on paper to wrap the gift and tape. So my expenditure is ` 8.
This gives me a profit of ` 2, which is, 2
only.
Sometimes when an article is bought, some additional expenses are made while buying or
before selling it. These expenses have to be included in the cost price.
These expenses are sometimes referred to as overhead charges. These may include
expenses like amount spent on repairs, labour charges, transportation etc.
8.4.1  Finding cost price/selling price, profit %/loss%
Example 5:  Sohan bought a second hand refrigerator for ` 2,500, then spent ` 500 on
its repairs and sold it for ` 3,300. Find his loss or gain per cent.
Solution: Cost Price (CP) = ` 2500 + ` 500 (overhead expenses are added to give CP)
= ` 3000
Sale Price (SP) = ` 3300
As SP > CP, he made a profit = ` 3300 – ` 3000 = ` 300
His profit on ` 3,000, is ` 300. How much would be his profit on ` 100?

(c) a fan bought for ` 560 and expenses of ` 40 made on its repairs.
Example 6:  A shopkeeper purchased 200 bulbs for ` 10 each. However 5 bulbs
were fused and had to be thrown away. The remaining were sold at ` 12 each. Find the
gain or loss %.
Solution: Cost price of 200 bulbs = ` 200 × 10 = ` 2000
5 bulbs were fused. Hence, number of bulbs left = 200 – 5 = 195
These were sold at ` 12 each.
The SP of 195 bulbs = ` 195 × 12 = ` 2340
He obviously made a profit (as SP > CP).
Profit = ` 2340 – ` 2000 = ` 340
On ` 2000, the profit is ` 340. How much profit is made on ` 100? Profit
= 340
2000 ×
= 17%.
Example 7:  Meenu bought two fans for ` 1200 each. She sold one at
a loss of 5% and the other at a profit of 10%. Find the selling price of
each. Also find out the total profit or loss.
Solution: Overall CP of each fan = ` 1200. One is sold at a loss of 5%.
This means if CP is ` 100,  SP is ` 95.
Therefore, when CP is ` 1200, then SP = ` 95
100 ×
= ` 1140
Also second fan is sold at a profit of 10%.
It means, if CP is ` 100, SP is ` 110.
Therefore, when CP is ` 1200, then SP = ` 110
100 ×
= ` 1320
Was there an overall loss or gain?
We need to find the combined CP and SP to say
whether there was an overall profit or loss.
Total CP = ` 1200 + ` 1200 = ` 2400
Total SP = ` 1140 + ` 1320 = ` 2460
Since total SP > total CP, a profit of ` (2460 – 2400) or ` 60 has been made.
1. A shopkeeper bought two TV sets at ` 10,000 each. He sold one at a profit 10%

The teacher showed the class a bill in which the following heads were written.
Bill No.

+ ST (5%)
Total
ST means Sales Tax, which we pay when we buy items.
This sales tax is charged by the government on the sale of an item.
It is collected by the shopkeeper from the customer and given to the government.
This is, therefore, always on the selling price of an item and is added to the value of the bill.
These days however, the prices include the tax known as Value Added Tax (VAT).
Example 8: (Finding Sales Tax) The cost of a pair of
roller skates at a shop was ` 450. The sales tax charged was
5%. Find the bill amount.
Solution:  On ` 100, the tax paid was ` 5.
On ` 450, the tax paid would be = ` 5
100 ×
= ` 22.50
Bill amount = Cost of item + Sales tax = ` 450 + ` 22.50 = ` 472.50.
Example 9: (Value Added Tax (VAT)) Waheeda bought an air cooler for ` 3300
including a tax of 10%. Find the price of the air cooler before VAT was added.
Solution: The price includes the VAT, i.e., the value added tax. Thus, a 10% VAT
means if the price without VAT is ` 100 then price including VAT is ` 110.
Now, when price including VAT is ` 110, original price is ` 100.
Hence when price including tax is ` 3300, the original price =  `100 3300

Interest is the extra money paid by institutions like banks or post offices on money
deposited (kept) with them. Interest is also paid by people when they borrow money.
We already know how to calculate Simple Interest.
Example 10: A sum of ` 10,000 is borrowed at a rate of interest 15% per annum for 2
years. Find the simple interest on this sum and the amount to be paid at the end of 2 years.
Solution: On ` 100, interest charged for 1 year is ` 15.
So, on ` 10,000, interest charged  = 15
10000
100 ×
= ` 1500
Interest for 2 years = ` 1500 × 2 = ` 3000
Amount to be paid at the end of 2 years = Principal + Interest
= ` 10000 + ` 3000 = ` 13000
Find interest and amount to be paid on ` 15000 at 5% per annum after 2 years.
My father has kept some money in the post office for 3 years. Every year the money
increases as more than the previous year.
We have some money in the bank. Every year some interest is added to it, which is
shown in the passbook. This interest is not the same, each year it increases.
Normally, the interest paid or charged is never simple. The interest is calculated on the
amount of the previous year. This is known as interest compounded or Compound
Interest (C.I.).
Let us take an example and find the interest year by year. Each year our sum or
principal changes.
Calculating Compound Interest
A sum of ` 20,000 is borrowed by Heena for 2 years at an interest of 8% compounded
annually. Find the Compound Interest (C.I.) and the amount she has to pay at the end of
2 years.
Aslam asked the teacher whether this means that they should find the interest year by
year. The teacher said ‘yes’,  and asked him to use the following steps :
1. Find the Simple Interest (S.I.) for one year.
Let the principal for the first year be P1. Here, P1 = ` 20,000
SI1 = SI at 8% p.a. for 1st year = ` 20000 8
= ` 1600
2. Then find the amount which will be paid or received. This becomes principal for the
next year.
Amount at the end of 1st year = P1 + SI1 = ` 20000 + ` 1600
= ` 21600 = P2 (Principal for 2nd year)
COMPARING QUANTITIES  127
3. Again find the interest on this sum for another year.
SI2 = SI at 8% p.a.for 2nd year = ` 21600
= ` 1728
4. Find the amount which has to be paid or received at the end of second year.
Amount at the end of 2nd year = P2 + SI2
= ` 21600 + ` 1728
= ` 23328
Total interest given = ` 1600 + ` 1728
= ` 3328
Reeta asked whether the amount would be different for simple interest. The teacher
told her to find the  interest for two years and see for herself.
SI for 2 years = ` 20000 8
= ` 3200
Reeta said that when compound interest was used Heena would pay ` 128 more.
Let us look at the difference between simple interest and compound interest. We start

Deducing a Formula for Compound Interest
Zubeda asked her teacher, ‘Is  there an easier way to find compound interest?’ The teacher
said ‘There is a shorter way of finding compound interest. Let us try to find it.’
Suppose P1 is the sum on which interest is compounded annually at a rate of R%
per annum.
Let P1 = ` 5000 and R = 5% per annum. Then by the steps mentioned above
SI1 = ` 5000
SI1 = `
so, A1 = ` 5000 + 5000
A1 = P1 + SI1 =
= ` 5000
1 100
⎠  = P2
SI2 = ` 5000

SI2 =
= ` 5000
A2 = `
5000 1
A2 = P2 + SI2
5000 1

⎠ = P3
Proceeding in this way the amount at the end of n years will be
P 1 100
Or, we can say
P 1 100
COMPARING QUANTITIES  129
So, Zubeda said, but using this we get only the formula for the amount to be paid at
the end of n years, and not the formula for compound interest.
Aruna at once said that we know CI = A – P, so we can easily find the compound
interest too.
Example 11:  Find CI on ` 12600 for 2 years at 10% per annum compounded
annually.
Solution: We have, A = P

CI = A – P = ` 15246 – ` 12600 = ` 2646
Rate Compounded Annually or Half Yearly
(Semi Annually)
You may want to know why ‘compounded
annually’ was mentioned after ‘rate’. Does it
mean anything?
It does, because we can also have interest
rates compounded half yearly or quarterly. Let

Time period and rate when interest not compounded
annually
The time period after which the interest is added each
time to form a new principal is called the conversion
period. When the interest is compounded half yearly,
there are two conversion periods in a year each after 6
months. In such situations, the half yearly rate will be
half of the annual rate. What will happen if interest is
compounded quarterly? In this case, there are 4
conversion periods in a year and the quarterly rate will
be one-fourth of the annual rate.

Do you see that, if interest is compounded half yearly, we compute the interest two
times. So time period becomes twice and rate is taken half.
Find the time period and rate for each .
1. A sum taken for 1
12  years at 8% per annum is compounded half yearly.
2. A sum taken for 2 years at 4% per annum compounded half yearly.
A sum is taken for one year at 16% p.a. If interest is compounded after every three
months, how many times will interest be charged in one year?
Example 12: What amount is to be repaid on a loan of ` 12000 for 1 1
2  years at 10%
per annum compounded half yearly.
Solution:
Principal for first 6 months = ` 12,000
Principal for first 6 months = ` 12,000
There are 3 half years in 1
12  years.
Time = 6 months = 6
Therefore, compounding has to be done 3 times.       Rate = 10%
Rate of interest = half of 10%
I = `
12000
= ` 600
= 5% half yearly
A = P + I  = ` 12000 + ` 600
= ` 12600. It is principal for next 6 months.

I = `
12600

Principal for third period = ` 12600 + ` 630

= ` 13,230.
I = `

Example 13:   Find CI paid when a sum of ` 10,000 is invested for 1 year and

Solution:  Mayuri first converted the time in years.

1 4  years
Mayuri tried putting the values in the known formula and came up with:
A = ` 10000
Now she was stuck. She asked her teacher how would she find a power which is fractional?
The teacher then gave her a hint:
Find the amount for the whole part, i.e., 1 year in this case. Then use this as principal
to get simple interest for 1
4  year more. Thus,
A = ` 10000
= ` 10000 × 217
200  = ` 10,850
Now this would act as principal for the next 1
4  year. We find the SI on ` 10,850
for 1
4  year.
SI =  `
10850
=  ` 10850
= ` 230.56
MATHEMATICS
Interest for first year = ` 10850 – ` 10000 = ` 850
And, interest for the next 1
4  year = ` 230.56
Therefore, total compound Interest = 850 + 230.56 = ` 1080.56.
8.9  Applications of Compound Interest Formula
There are some situations where we could use the formula for calculation of amount in CI.
Here are a few.
(i) Increase (or decrease) in population.
(ii) The growth of a bacteria if the rate of growth is known.
(iii) The value of an item, if its price increases or decreases in the intermediate years.
Example 14:  The population of a city was 20,000 in the year 1997. It increased at
the rate of 5% p.a. Find the population at the end of the year 2000.
Solution:  There is 5% increase in population every year, so every new year has new
population. Thus, we can say it is increasing in compounded form.
Population in the beginning of 1998 = 20000  (we treat this as the principal for the 1st year)
Increase at 5% =  5
20000
100 ×
Population in 1999 = 20000 + 1000 = 21000
Increase at 5% =  5
21000
100 ×
Population in 2000 = 21000 + 1050
= 22050
Increase at 5% =  5
22050
100 ×
= 1102.5
At the end of 2000 the population = 22050 + 1102.5 = 23152.5
Population at the end of 2000 = 20000
20000
= 23152.5
So, the estimated population = 23153.

the following example.
Example 15: A TV was bought at a price of ` 21,000. After one year the value of the
TV was depreciated by 5% (Depreciation means reduction of value due to use and age of
the item). Find the value of the TV after one year.
Solution:
Principal = ` 21,000
Reduction = 5% of ` 21000 per year
= ` 21000

ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND IDENTITIES  137
9.1  What are Expressions?
In earlier classes, we have already become familiar with what algebraic expressions
(or simply expressions) are. Examples of expressions are:
x + 3, 2y – 5, 3x2, 4xy + 7 etc.
You can form many more expressions. As you know expressions are formed from
variables and constants. The expression 2y – 5 is formed from the variable y and constants
2 and 5. The expression 4xy + 7 is formed from variables x and y and constants 4 and 7.
We know that, the value of y in the expression, 2y – 5, may be anything. It can be
2, 5, –3, 0, 5
3  etc.; actually countless different values. The value of an expression
changes with the value chosen for the variables it contains. Thus as y takes on different
values, the value of 2y – 5 goes on changing. When y = 2, 2y – 5 = 2(2) – 5 = –1; when
y = 0, 2y – 5 = 2 × 0 –5 = –5, etc. Find the value of the expression 2y – 5 for the other
given values of y.
Number line and an expression:
Consider the expression x + 5. Let us say the variable x has a position X on the number line;
X may be anywhere on the number line, but it is definite that the value of x + 5 is given by
a point P, 5 units to the right of  X. Similarly, the value of x – 4 will be 4 units to the left of
X and so on.
What about the position of 4x and 4x + 5?
The position of 4x will be point C; the distance of C from the origin will be four times
the distance of X from the origin. The position D of 4x + 5 will be 5 units to the right of C.

9.2  Terms, Factors and Coefficients
Take the expression 4x + 5. This expression is made up of two terms, 4x and 5. Terms
are added to form expressions. Terms themselves can be formed as the product of
factors. The term 4x is the product of its factors 4 and x. The term 5
is made up of just one factor, i.e., 5.
The expression 7xy – 5x has two terms 7xy and –5x. The term
7xy is a product of factors 7, x and y. The numerical factor of a term
is called its numerical coefficient or simply coefficient. The coefficient
in the term 7xy is 7 and the coefficient in the term –5x is –5.
9.3  Monomials, Binomials and Polynomials
Expression that contains only one term is called a monomial. Expression that contains two
terms is called a binomial. An expression containing three terms is a trinomial and so on.
In general, an expression containing, one or more terms with non-zero coefficient (with
variables having non negative exponents) is called a polynomial. A polynomial may contain
any number of terms, one or more than one.
Examples of monomials:
4x2, 3xy, –7z, 5xy2, 10y, –9, 82mnp, etc.
Examples of binomials:
a + b, 4l + 5m, a + 4, 5 –3xy, z2 – 4y2, etc.
Examples of trinomials:

9.5  Addition and Subtraction of Algebraic Expressions
In the earlier classes, we have also learnt how to add and subtract algebraic expressions.
For example, to add  7x2 – 4x + 5 and 9x – 10, we do
7x2 – 4x + 5
9x – 10
7x2 + 5x – 5
Observe how we do the addition. We write each expression to be added in a separate
row. While doing so we write like terms one below the other, and add them, as shown.
Thus 5 + (–10) = 5 –10 = –5. Similarly, – 4x + 9x = (– 4 + 9)x = 5x. Let us take some
more examples.
Example 1: Add: 7xy + 5yz – 3zx, 4yz + 9zx – 4y , –3xz + 5x – 2xy.
Solution: Writing the three expressions in separate rows, with like terms one below
the other, we have
7xy + 5yz –3zx
4yz +  9zx        – 4y
– 3zx + 5x
(Note xz is same as zx)
5xy  +  9yz +3zx + 5x – 4y
Thus, the sum of the expressions is 5xy + 9yz + 3zx + 5x – 4y. Note how the terms, – 4y
in the second expression and 5x in the third expression, are carried over as they are, since
they have no like terms in the other expressions.
Example 2: Subtract 5x2 – 4y2 + 6y – 3 from 7x2 – 4xy + 8y2 + 5x – 3y.
Solution:
7x2 – 4xy + 8y2 + 5x – 3y
– 4y2
+ 6y – 3
(+)            (–)    (+)
2x2 – 4xy + 12y2 + 5x – 9y + 3
MATHEMATICS
Note that subtraction of a number is the same as addition of its additive inverse.
Thus subtracting –3 is the same as adding +3. Similarly, subtracting 6y is the same as
adding – 6y; subtracting – 4y2 is the same as adding 4y2 and so on. The signs in the
third row written below each term in the second row help us in knowing which
operation has to be performed.

(ii) Can you now think of similar other situations in which
two algebraic expressions have to be multiplied?
Ameena gets up. She says, “We can think of area of
a rectangle.” The area of a rectangle is l × b, where l
is the length, and b is breadth. If the length of the
rectangle is increased by 5 units, i.e., (l + 5) and
breadth is decreased by 3 units , i.e., (b – 3) units,
the area of the new rectangle will be (l + 5) × (b – 3).
(iii) Can you think about volume? (The volume of a
rectangular box is given by the product of its length,
breadth and height).
(iv) Sarita points out that when we buy things, we have to
carry out multiplication. For example, if
price of bananas per dozen = ` p
and for the school picnic bananas needed = z dozens,
then we have to pay = ` p × z
Suppose, the price per dozen was less by ` 2 and the bananas needed were less by
4 dozens.
Then,
price of bananas per dozen = ` (p – 2)
bananas needed = (z – 4) dozens,
Therefore, we would have to pay
= ` (p – 2) × (z – 4)
To find the area of a rectangle, we
have to multiply algebraic
expressions like l × b or
(l + 5) × (b – 3).
Here the number of rows
is increased by
2, i.e., m + 2 and number
of columns increased by
3, i.e., n + 3.
To find the number of
dots we have to multiply
the expression for the
number of rows by the
expression for the
number of columns.

products of monomials, 3xy,
15xy, –15xy, are also

Can you think of two more such situations, where we may need to multiply algebraic
expressions?
[Hint: • Think of speed and time;
• Think of interest to be paid, the principal and the rate of simple interest; etc.]
In all the above examples, we had to carry out multiplication of two or more quantities. If
the quantities are given by algebraic expressions, we need to find their product. This
means that we should know how to obtain this product. Let us do this systematically. To
begin with we shall look at the multiplication of two monomials.
9.7  Multiplying a Monomial by a Monomial
9.7.1  Multiplying two monomials
We begin with
4 × x = x + x + x + x = 4x  as seen earlier.
Similarly,
4 × (3x) = 3x + 3x + 3x + 3x = 12x
Now, observe the following products.
x × 3y = x × 3 × y = 3 × x × y = 3xy
5x × 3y = 5 × x × 3 × y = 5 × 3 × x × y  = 15xy
(iii)
5x × (–3y) = 5 × x × (–3) × y
= 5 × (–3) × x × y  = –15xy
Note that
5 × 4 = 20
i.e., coefficient of product = coefficient of
first monomial × coefficient of second
monomial;
x × x2 = x 3
i.e.,  algebraic factor of product
= algebraic factor of first monomial
× algebraic factor of second monomial.
Some more useful examples follow.
5x × 4x2 = (5 × 4) × (x × x2)
=  20 × x3 = 20x3
(v) 5x × (– 4xyz) = (5 × – 4) × (x × xyz)
= –20 × (x × x × yz) = –20x2yz
Observe how we collect the powers of different variables
in the algebraic parts of the two monomials. While doing
so, we use the rules of exponents and powers.
9.7.2  Multiplying three or more monomials
Observe the following examples.
2x × 5y × 7z = (2x × 5y) × 7z = 10xy × 7z = 70xyz
4xy × 5x2y2 × 6x3y3 = (4xy × 5x2y2) × 6x3y3 = 20x3y3 × 6x3y3 = 120x3y3 × x3y3
= 120 (x3 × x3) × (y3 × y3) = 120x6 × y6 = 120x6y6
It is clear that we first multiply the first two monomials and then multiply the resulting
monomial by the third monomial. This method can be extended to the product of any
number of monomials.

9.8.1  Multiplying a monomial by a binomial
Let us multiply the monomial 3x by the binomial 5y + 2, i.e., find 3x × (5y + 2) = ?
Recall that 3x and (5y + 2) represent numbers. Therefore, using the distributive law,
3x × (5y + 2) = (3x × 5y) + (3x × 2) = 15xy + 6x
We commonly use distributive law in our calculations. For example:
7 × 106 = 7 × (100 + 6)
= 7 × 100 + 7 × 6
(Here, we used distributive law)
= 700 + 42 = 742
7 × 38 = 7 × (40 – 2)
= 7 × 40 – 7 × 2
(Here, we used distributive law)
= 280 – 14 = 266
Similarly,
(–3x) × (–5y + 2) = (–3x) × (–5y) + (–3x) × (2) = 15xy – 6x
5xy × (y2 + 3) = (5xy × y2) + (5xy × 3) = 5xy3 + 15xy.
What about a binomial × monomial? For example, (5y + 2) × 3x = ?
We may use commutative law as : 7 × 3 = 3 × 7; or in general  a × b = b × a
Similarly,
(5y + 2) × 3x = 3x × (5y + 2) = 15xy + 6x as before.

9.8.2  Multiplying a monomial by a trinomial
Consider 3p × (4p2 + 5p + 7). As in the earlier case, we use distributive law;
3p × (4p2 + 5p + 7) = (3p × 4p2) + (3p × 5p) + (3p × 7)
= 12p3 + 15p2 + 21p
Multiply each term of the trinomial by the monomial and add products.
Observe, by using the distributive law, we are able to carry out the
multiplication term by term.
Example 5: Simplify the expressions and evaluate them as directed:
(i) x (x – 3) + 2 for x = 1,
(ii) 3y (2y – 7) – 3 (y – 4) – 63 for y = –2
Solution:
(i) x (x – 3) + 2 = x2 – 3x + 2
x = 1, x2 – 3x + 2 = (1)2 – 3 (1) + 2
= 1 – 3 + 2 = 3 – 3 = 0
(ii) 3y (2y – 7) – 3 (y – 4) – 63 = 6y2 – 21y – 3y + 12 – 63
= 6y2 – 24y – 51
For y = –2, 6y2 – 24y – 51 = 6 (–2)2 – 24(–2) – 51
= 6 × 4 + 24 × 2 – 51
= 24 + 48 – 51 = 72 – 51 = 21
Example 6: Add
(i) 5m (3 – m) and 6m2 – 13m
(ii) 4y (3y2 + 5y – 7) and 2 (y3 – 4y2 + 5)
Solution:
(i) First expression = 5m (3 – m) = (5m × 3) – (5m × m) = 15m – 5m2
Now adding the second expression to it,15m – 5m2 + 6m2 – 13m = m2 + 2m
(ii) The first expression = 4y (3y2 + 5y – 7) = (4y × 3y2) + (4y × 5y) + (4y × (–7))
= 12y3 + 20y2 – 28y
The second expression = 2 (y3 – 4y2 + 5) = 2y3 + 2 × (– 4y2) + 2 × 5
= 2y3 – 8y2 + 10
Adding the two expressions,
20y2 – 28y
12y2 – 28y
Example 7: Subtract 3pq (p – q) from 2pq (p + q).

Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial
9.9.1  Multiplying a binomial by a binomial
Let us multiply one binomial (2a + 3b) by another binomial, say (3a + 4b). We do this
step-by-step, as we did in earlier cases, following the distributive law of multiplication,
(3a + 4b) × (2a + 3b) = 3a × (2a + 3b) + 4b × (2a + 3b)
= (3a × 2a) + (3a × 3b) + (4b × 2a) + (4b × 3b)
= 6a2 + 9ab + 8ba + 12b2
= 6a2 + 17ab + 12b2
(Since ba = ab)
When we carry out term by term multiplication, we expect 2 × 2 = 4 terms to be
present. But two of these are like terms, which are combined, and hence we get 3 terms.
In multiplication of polynomials with polynomials, we should always look for like
terms, if any, and combine them.
Observe, every term in one
binomial multiplies every
term in the other binomial.

Example 8: Multiply
(i) (x – 4) and (2x + 3)
(ii)  (x – y) and (3x + 5y)
Solution:

= (x × 2x) + (x × 3) – (4 × 2x) – (4 × 3) = 2x2 + 3x – 8x – 12
= 2x2 – 5x – 12
(Adding like terms)
(ii) (x – y) × (3x + 5y) = x × (3x + 5y) – y × (3x + 5y)
= (x × 3x) + (x × 5y) – (y × 3x) – ( y × 5y)
= 3x2 + 5xy – 3yx – 5y2 = 3x2 + 2xy – 5y2    (Adding like terms)
Example 9:  Multiply
(i) (a + 7) and (b – 5)
(ii) (a2 + 2b2) and (5a – 3b)
Solution:
(i) (a + 7) × (b – 5) = a × (b – 5) + 7 × (b – 5)
= ab – 5a + 7b – 35
Note that there are no like terms involved in this multiplication.
(ii) (a2 + 2b2) × (5a – 3b) = a2 (5a – 3b) + 2b2 × (5a – 3b)
= 5a3 – 3a2b + 10ab2 – 6b3
9.9.2  Multiplying a binomial by a trinomial
In this multiplication, we shall have to multiply each of the three terms in the trinomial by
each of the two terms in the binomial. We shall get in all 3 × 2 = 6 terms, which may
reduce to 5 or less, if the term by term multiplication results in like terms. Consider
binomial
trinomial
= a × (a2 + 3a + 5) + 7 × (a2 + 3a + 5)
= a3 + 3a2 + 5a + 7a2 + 21a + 35
= a3 + (3a2 + 7a2) + (5a + 21a) + 35
= a3 + 10a2 + 26a + 35
(Why are there only 4
terms in the final result?)
Example 10: Simplify (a + b) (2a – 3b + c) – (2a – 3b) c.
Solution: We have
(a + b) (2a – 3b + c) = a (2a – 3b + c) + b (2a – 3b + c)
= 2a2 – 3ab + ac + 2ab – 3b2 + bc
= 2a2 – ab – 3b2 + bc + ac
(Note, –3ab and 2ab
are like terms)
(2a – 3b) c = 2ac – 3bc
Therefore,
(a + b) (2a – 3b + c) – (2a – 3b) c = 2a2 – ab – 3b2 + bc + ac – (2ac – 3bc)
= 2a2 – ab – 3b2 + bc + ac – 2ac + 3bc
= 2a2 – ab – 3b2 + (bc + 3bc) + (ac – 2ac)
= 2a2 – 3b2 – ab + 4bc – ac

9.10  What is an Identity?
Consider the equality
(a + 1) (a +2) = a2 + 3a + 2
We shall evaluate both sides of this equality for some value of a, say a = 10.
For a = 10,
LHS = (a + 1) (a + 2) = (10 + 1) (10 + 2) = 11 × 12 = 132
RHS = a2 + 3a + 2 = 102 + 3 × 10 + 2 = 100 + 30 + 2 = 132
Thus, the values of the two sides of the equality are equal for a = 10.
Let us now take a = –5
LHS = (a + 1) (a + 2) = (–5 + 1) (–5 + 2) = (– 4) × (–3) = 12
RHS = a2 + 3a + 2 = (–5)2 + 3 (–5) + 2
= 25 – 15 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12
Thus, for a = –5, also LHS = RHS.
We shall find that for any value of a, LHS = RHS. Such an equality, true for every
value of the variable in it, is called an identity. Thus,
(a + 1) (a + 2) =  a2 + 3a + 2  is an identity.
An equation is true for only certain values of the variable in it. It is not true for
all values of the variable. For example, consider the equation
a2 + 3a + 2 = 132
It is true for a = 10, as seen above, but it is not true for a = –5 or for a = 0 etc.
Try it: Show that a2 + 3a + 2 = 132 is not true for a = –5 and for a = 0.
9.11  Standard Identities
We shall now study three identities which are very useful in our work. These identities are
obtained by multiplying a binomial by another binomial.
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND IDENTITIES  149
TRY THESE
TRY THESE
Let us first consider the product (a + b) (a + b) or (a + b)2.
(a + b)2 = (a + b) (a + b)
= a(a + b) + b (a + b)
= a2 + ab + ba + b2
= a2 + 2ab + b2
(since ab = ba)
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
Clearly, this is an identity, since the expression on the RHS is obtained from the LHS by
actual multiplication. One may verify that for any value of a and any value of b, the values of
the two sides are equal.
• Next we consider (a – b)2 = (a – b) (a – b) = a (a – b) – b (a – b)
We have
= a2 – ab – ba + b2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
(a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
• Finally, consider (a + b) (a – b). We have (a + b) (a – b) = a (a – b) + b (a – b)
= a2 – ab + ba – b2  = a2 – b2(since ab = ba)
(a + b) (a – b) = a2 – b2
(III)
The identities (I), (II) and (III) are known as standard identities.
1. Put – b in place of b in Identity (I). Do you get Identity (II)?
• We shall now work out one more useful identity.
(x + a) (x + b) = x (x + b) + a (x + b)
= x2 + bx + ax + ab
(x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a + b) x + ab
1. Verify Identity (IV), for a = 2, b = 3, x = 5.
2. Consider, the special case of Identity (IV) with a = b, what do you get? Is it
related to Identity (I)?
3. Consider, the special case of Identity (IV) with a = – c and b = – c. What do you
get? Is it related to Identity (II)?
4. Consider the special case of Identity (IV) with b = – a. What do you get? Is it
related to Identity (III)?
We can see that Identity (IV) is the general form of the other three identities also.
9.12  Applying Identities
We shall now see how, for many problems on multiplication of binomial expressions and
also of numbers, use of the identities gives a simple alternative method of solving them.
MATHEMATICS
Example 11:  Using the Identity (I), find
(i)  (2x + 3y)2
(ii)  1032
Solution:
(2x + 3y)2 = (2x)2 + 2(2x) (3y) + (3y)2
[Using the Identity (I)]
= 4x2 + 12xy + 9y2
We may work out (2x + 3y)2 directly.
(2x + 3y)2 = (2x + 3y) (2x + 3y)
= (2x) (2x) + (2x) (3y) + (3y) (2x) + (3y) (3y)
= 4x2 + 6xy + 6 yx + 9y2
(as xy = yx)
= 4x2 + 12xy + 9y2
Using Identity (I) gave us an alternative method of squaring (2x + 3y). Do you notice that
the Identity method required fewer steps than the above direct method? You will realise
the simplicity of this method even more if you try to square more complicated binomial
expressions than (2x + 3y).
(103)2 = (100 + 3)2
= 1002 + 2 × 100 × 3 + 32
(Using Identity I)
= 10000 + 600 + 9 = 10609
We may also directly multiply 103 by 103 and get the answer. Do you see that Identity (I)
has given us a less tedious method than the direct method of squaring 103? Try squaring
1013. You will find in this case, the method of using identities even more attractive than the
direct multiplication method.
Example 12: Using Identity (II), find       (i)  (4p – 3q)2
(ii)  (4.9)2
Solution:
(i) (4p – 3q)2 =(4p)2 – 2 (4p) (3q) + (3q)2
[Using the Identity (II)]
= 16p2 – 24pq + 9q2
Do you agree that for squaring (4p – 3q)2 the method of identities is quicker than the
direct method?
(ii) (4.9)2 =(5.0 – 0.1)2 = (5.0)2 – 2 (5.0) (0.1) + (0.1)2
= 25.00 – 1.00 + 0.01 = 24.01
Is it not that, squaring 4.9 using Identity (II) is much less tedious than squaring it by
direct multiplication?
Example 13: Using Identity (III), find
9832 – 172
(iii)
194 × 206
Solution:
(ii) 9832 – 172 = (983 + 17) (983 – 17)
[Here a = 983, b =17, a2 – b2 = (a + b) (a – b)]
Therefore,
9832 – 172 = 1000 × 966 = 966000
Try doing this directly.
You will realise how easy
our method of using
Identity (III) is.

following:
(i) 501 × 502
(ii) 95 × 103
Solution:
501 × 502 = (500 + 1) × (500 + 2) = 5002 + (1 + 2) × 500 + 1 × 2
= 250000 + 1500 + 2 = 251502
95 × 103 = (100 – 5) × (100 + 3) = 1002 + (–5 + 3) × 100 + (–5) × 3
= 10000 – 200 – 15 = 9785

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Expressions are formed from variables and constants.
2. Terms are added to form expressions. Terms themselves are formed as product of factors.
3. Expressions that contain exactly one, two and three terms are called monomials, binomials and
trinomials respectively. In general, any expression containing one or more terms with non-zero
coefficients (and with variables having non- negative exponents) is called a polynomial.
4. Like terms are formed from the same variables and the powers of these variables are the same,
too. Coefficients of like terms need not be the same.
5. While adding (or subtracting) polynomials, first look for like terms and add (or subtract) them;
then handle the unlike terms.
6. There are number of situations in which we need to multiply algebraic expressions: for example, in
finding area of a rectangle, the sides of which are given as expressions.
7. A monomial multiplied by a monomial always gives a monomial.
8. While multiplying a polynomial by a monomial, we multiply every term in the polynomial by the
monomial.
9. In carrying out the multiplication of a polynomial by a binomial (or trinomial), we multiply term by
term, i.e., every term of the polynomial is multiplied by every term in the binomial (or trinomial).
Note that in such multiplication, we may get terms in the product which are like and have to be
combined.
10. An identity is an equality, which is true for all values of the variables in the equality.
On the other hand, an equation is true only for certain values of its variables. An equation is not an
identity.
11. The following are the standard identities:
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
(a + b) (a – b) = a2 – b2
(III)
12. Another useful identity is (x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a + b) x + ab          (IV)
13. The above four identities are useful in carrying out squares and products of algebraic expressions.
They also allow easy alternative methods to calculate products of numbers and so on.

10.1  Introduction
In Class VII, you have learnt about plane shapes and solid shapes. Plane shapes have two
measurements like length and breadth and therefore they are called two-dimensional shapes
whereas a solid object has three measurements like length, breadth, height or depth. Hence,
they are called three-dimensional shapes. Also, a solid object occupies some space.
Two-dimensional and three-dimensional figures can also be briefly named as 2-D and 3-
D figures. You may recall that triangle, rectangle, circle etc., are 2-D figures while cubes,
cylinders, cones, spheres etc. are three-dimensional figures.

10.3  Mapping Space Around Us
You have been dealing with maps since you were in primary, classes. In Geography, you
have been asked to locate a particular State, a particular river, a mountain etc., on a map.
In History, you might have been asked to locate a particular place where some event had
occured long back. You have traced routes of rivers, roads, railwaylines, traders and
many others.
How do we read maps? What can we conclude and understand while reading a map?
What information does a map have and what it does not have? Is it any different from a
picture? In this section, we will try to find answers to some of these questions. Look at the
map of a house whose picture is given alongside (Fig 10.1).
Fig 10.1
Front

VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES  161
What can we conclude from the above illustration? When we draw a picture, we attempt
to represent reality as it is seen with all its details, whereas, a map depicts only the location of
an object, in relation to other objects. Secondly, different persons can give descriptions of
pictures completely different from one another, depending upon the position from which they
are looking at the house. But, this is not true in the case of a map. The map of the house
remains the same irrespective of the position of the observer. In other words, perspective
is very important for drawing a picture but it is not relevant for a map.
Now, look at the map (Fig 10.2), which has been drawn by
seven year old Raghav, as the route from his house to his school:
From this map, can you tell –
(i) how far is Raghav’s school from his house?
(ii) would every circle in the map depict a round about?
(iii) whose school is nearer to the house, Raghav’s or his sister’s?
It is very difficult to answer the above questions on the basis of
the given map. Can you tell why?
The reason is that we do not know if the distances have been
drawn properly or whether the circles drawn are  roundabouts or
represent something else.
Now look at another map drawn by his sister,
ten year old Meena, to show the route from her
house to her school (Fig 10.3).
This map is different from the earlier maps. Here,
Meena has used different symbols for different
landmarks. Secondly, longer line segments have
been drawn for longer distances and shorter line
segments have been drawn for shorter distances,
i.e., she has drawn the map to a scale.
Now, you can answer the following questions:
• How far is Raghav’s school from his
residence?
• Whose school is nearer to the house, Raghav’s or Meena’s?
• Which are the important landmarks on the route?
Thus we realise that, use of certain symbols and mentioning of distances has helped us
read the map easily. Observe that the distances shown on the map are proportional to the
actual distances on the ground. This is done by considering a proper scale. While drawing
(or reading) a map, one must know, to what scale it has to be drawn (or has been drawn),
i.e., how much of actual distance is denoted by 1mm or 1cm in the map. This means, that if
one draws a map, he/she has to decide that 1cm of space in that map shows a certain fixed
distance of say 1 km or 10 km. This scale can vary from map to map but not within a map.
For instance, look at the map of India alongside the map of Delhi.
My school
Fig 10.2
My house
My sister’s school
Fig 10.3
MATHEMATICS
You will find that when the maps are drawn of same size, scales and the distances in
the two maps will vary. That is 1 cm of space in the map of Delhi will represent smaller
distances as compared to the distances in the map of India.
The larger the place and smaller the size of the map drawn, the greater is the distance
represented by 1 cm.
Thus, we can summarise that:
1. A map depicts the location of a particular object/place in relation to other objects/places.
2. Symbols are used to depict the different objects/places.
3. There is no reference or perspective in map, i.e., objects that are closer to the
observer are shown to be of the same size as those that are farther away. For
example,  look at the following illustration (Fig 10.4).
Fig 10.4
4. Maps use a scale which is fixed for a particular map. It reduces the real distances
proportionately to distances on the paper.

10.4  Faces, Edges and Vertices
Look at the following solids!
Riddle
I have no vertices.
I have no flat
faces. Who am I?
MATHEMATICS
Each of these solids is made up of polygonal regions which are called its faces;
these faces meet at edges which are line segments; and the edges meet at vertices which
are points. Such solids are called polyhedrons.
These are polyhedrons
These are not polyhedrons
How are the polyhedrons different from the non-polyhedrons? Study the figures
carefully. You know three other types of common solids.
Convex polyhedrons: You will recall the concept of convex polygons. The idea of
convex polyhedron is similar.
These are convex polyhedrons
These are not convex polyhedrons
Regular polyhedrons: A polyhedron is said to be regular if its faces are made up of
regular polygons and the same number of faces meet at each vertex.

Two important members of polyhedron family around are prisms and pyramids.
These are prisms
These are pyramids
We say that a prism is a polyhedron whose base and top are congruent  polygons
and whose other faces, i.e., lateral faces are parallelograms in shape.
On the other hand, a pyramid is a polyhedron whose base is a polygon (of any
number of sides) and whose lateral faces are triangles with a common vertex. (If you join
all the corners of a polygon to a point not in its plane, you get a model for pyramid).
A prism or a pyramid is named after its base. Thus a hexagonal prism has a hexagon
as its base; and a triangular pyramid has a triangle as its base. What, then, is a rectangular
prism? What is a square pyramid? Clearly their bases are rectangle and square respectively.
Tabulate the number of faces, edges and vertices for the following polyhedrons:

for number of edges).

11.1  Introduction
We have learnt that for a closed plane figure, the perimeter is the distance around its
boundary and its area is the region covered by it. We found the area and perimeter of
various plane figures such as triangles, rectangles, circles etc. We have also learnt to find
the area of pathways or borders in rectangular shapes.
In this chapter, we will try to solve problems related to perimeter and area of other
plane closed figures like quadrilaterals.
We will also learn about surface area and volume of solids such as cube, cuboid and
cylinder.
11.2  Let us Recall
Let us take an example to review our previous knowledge.
This is a figure of a rectangular park (Fig 11.1) whose length is 30 m and width is 20 m.
(i) What is the total length of the fence surrounding it? To find the length of the fence we
need to find the perimeter of this park, which is 100 m.
(Check it)
(ii) How much land is occupied by the park? To find the
land occupied by this park we need to find the area of
this park which is 600 square meters (m2) (How?).
(iii) There is a path of one metre width running inside along
the perimeter of the park that has to be cemented.
If 1 bag of cement is required to cement 4 m2 area, how
many bags of cement would be required to construct the
cemented path?
We can say that the number of cement bags used =
area of the path
area cemented by 1 bag .
Area of cemented path = Area of park – Area of park not cemented.
Path is 1 m wide, so the rectangular area not cemented is (30 – 2) × (20 – 2) m2.
That  is 28 × 18 m2.
Hence number of cement bags used = ------------------
(iv) There are two rectangular flower beds of size 1.5 m × 2 m each in the park as
shown in the diagram (Fig 11.1) and the rest has grass on it. Find the area covered

around the house. Find the total cost of developing a garden around
the house at the rate of ` 55 per m2.
3. The shape of a garden is rectangular in the middle and semi circular
at the ends as shown in the diagram. Find the area and the perimeter
of this garden [Length of rectangle is

4. A flooring tile has the shape of a parallelogram whose base is 24 cm and the
corresponding height is 10 cm. How many such tiles are required to cover a floor of
area 1080 m2? (If required you can split the tiles in whatever way you want to fill up
the corners).
5. An ant is moving around a few food pieces of different shapes scattered on the floor.
For which food-piece  would the ant have to take a longer round? Remember,
circumference of a circle can be obtained by using the expression c = 2πr, where r
is the radius of the circle.
11.3  Area of Trapezium
Nazma owns a plot near a main road
(Fig 11.2). Unlike some other rectangular
plots in her neighbourhood, the plot has
only one pair of parallel opposite sides.
So, it is nearly a trapezium in shape. Can
you find out its area?
Let us name the vertices of this plot as
shown in Fig 11.3.
By drawing EC || AB, we can divide it
into two parts, one of rectangular shape
and the other of triangular shape, (which
is right angled at C), as shown in Fig 11.3.

Area of trapezium ABDE = area of Δ ECD + Area of rectangle ABCE = 60 + 240 = 300 m2.
We can write the area by combining the two areas and write the area of trapezium as

4. The area of this triangle and the area of the trapezium WXYZ are same (How?).
Get the expression for the area of trapezium by using the expression for the area
of triangle.
So to find the area of a trapezium we need to know the length of the parallel sides and the
perpendicular distance between these two parallel sides. Half the product of the sum of
the lengths of parallel sides and the perpendicular distance between them gives the area of
trapezium.
Find the area of the following trapeziums (Fig 11.8).

11.4  Area of a General Quadrilateral
A general quadrilateral can be split into two triangles by drawing one of its diagonals. This
“triangulation” helps us to find a formula for any general quadrilateral. Study the Fig 11.10.
Area of quadrilateral ABCD
= (area of Δ ABC) + (area of  Δ ADC)
= ( 1
2 AC × h1) + ( 1
2 AC × h2)
2 AC × ( h1 +  h2)
2  d ( h1 +  h2) where d denotes the length of diagonal AC.
Example 1:  Find the area of quadrilateral PQRS shown in Fig 11.11.
Solution:  In this case, d = 5.5 cm, h1 = 2.5cm, h2 = 1.5 cm,
Area = 1
2  d ( h1 +  h2)
2  × 5.5 × (2.5 + 1.5) cm2
2 × 5.5 × 4 cm2  = 11 cm2
We know that parallelogram is also a quadrilateral. Let us
also split such a quadrilateral into two triangles, find their
areas and hence that of the parallelogram. Does this agree
with the formula that you know already? (Fig 11.12)
11.4.1  Area of special quadrilaterals
We can use the same method of splitting into triangles (which we called “triangulation”) to
find a formula for the area of a rhombus. In  Fig 11.13  ABCD is a rhombus. Therefore, its
diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
Area of rhombus ABCD = (area of Δ ACD) + (area of  Δ ABC)

Solution: Area of the rhombus = 1

A parallelogram is divided into two congruent triangles by drawing a diagonal across
it. Can we divide a trapezium into two congruent triangles?

11.5  Area of a Polygon
We split a quadrilateral into triangles and find its area. Similar methods can be used to find
the area of a polygon. Observe the following for a pentagon: (Fig 11.15, 11.16)
By constructing one diagonal AD and two perpendiculars BF
and CG on it, pentagon ABCDE is divided into four parts. So,
area of ABCDE = area of right angled Δ AFB +  area of
trapezium BFGC + area of right angled Δ CGD + area of
Δ AED. (Identify the parallel sides of trapezium BFGC.)
By constructing two diagonals AC and AD the
pentagon ABCDE is divided into three parts.
So, area ABCDE = area of  Δ ABC + area of
Δ ACD + area of Δ AED.

MP = 9 cm, MD = 7 cm, MC = 6 cm, MB = 4 cm,
MA = 2 cm
NA, OC, QD and RB are perpendiculars to
diagonal MP.
Example 1: The area of a trapezium shaped field is 480 m2, the distance between two
parallel sides is 15 m and one of the parallel side  is 20 m. Find the other parallel side.
Solution: One of the parallel sides of the trapezium is a = 20 m, let another parallel
side be b, height h = 15 m.
The given area of trapezium = 480 m2.
Area of a trapezium = 1
2 h (a + b)
So    480 = 1
2 × 15 × (20 + b)     or     480
= 20 + b
or      64 = 20 + b   or   b = 44 m
Hence the other parallel side of the trapezium is 44 m.

Example 2: The area of a rhombus is 240 cm2 and one of the diagonals is 16 cm. Find

Therefore,
d2 = 30 cm
Hence the length of the second diagonal is 30 cm.

Find the area of this hexagon using both ways.

Fig 11.21
Solution: Aman’s method:
Since it is a hexagon so NQ divides the hexagon into two congruent trapeziums. You can
verify it by paper folding (Fig 11.22).
Now area of trapezium MNQR =
= 2 × 16 = 32 cm2.
So the area of hexagon MNOPQR = 2 × 32 = 64 cm2.
Ridhima’s method:
Δ MNO and Δ RPQ are congruent triangles with altitude
3 cm (Fig 11.23).
You can verify this by cutting off these two triangles and
placing them on one another.
Area of Δ MNO = 1
2  × 8 × 3 = 12 cm2 = Area of Δ RPQ
Area of rectangle MOPR = 8 × 5 = 40 cm2.
Now, area of hexagon MNOPQR = 40 + 12 + 12 = 64 cm2.

Did you notice the following:
The cylinder has congruent circular faces that are parallel
to each other (Fig 11.26). Observe that the line segment joining
the center of circular faces is perpendicular to the base. Such
cylinders are known as right circular cylinders. We are only
going to study this type of cylinders, though there are other
types of cylinders as well (Fig 11.27).
Why is it incorrect to call the solid shown here a cylinder?
11.7  Surface Area of Cube, Cuboid and Cylinder
Imran, Monica and Jaspal are painting a cuboidal, cubical and a cylindrical box respectively
of same height (Fig 11.28).
Fig 11.28
They try to determine who has painted more area. Hari suggested that finding the
surface area of each box would help them find it out.
To find the total surface area, find the area of each face and then add. The surface
area of a solid is the sum of the areas of its faces. To clarify further, we take each shape
one by one.
11.7.1  Cuboid
Suppose you cut open a cuboidal box
and lay it flat (Fig 11.29). We can see
a net as shown below (Fig 11.30).
Write the dimension of each side.
You know that a cuboid has three
pairs of identical faces. What
expression can you use to find the
area of each face?
Find the total area of all the faces
of the box. We see that the total surface area of a cuboid is area I + area II + area III +
area IV +area V + area VI
= h × l + b × l + b × h + l × h + b × h + l × b

So total surface area = 2 (h × l + b × h + b × l) = 2(lb + bh  + hl)
where h, l and b are the height, length and width of the cuboid respectively.
Suppose the height, length and width of the box shown above are 20 cm, 15 cm and
10 cm respectively.
Then the total surface area = 2 (20 × 15  +  20 × 10  +  10 × 15)
= 2 ( 300 + 200 + 150) = 1300 m2.
Find the total surface area of the following
cuboids (Fig 11.31):
Fig 11.32
Fig 11.31
•   The side walls (the faces excluding the top and
bottom) make the lateral surface area of the
cuboid. For example, the total area of all the four
walls of the cuboidal room in which you are sitting
is the lateral surface area of this room (Fig 11.32).
Hence, the lateral surface area of a cuboid is given
by 2(h × l + b × h) or 2h (l + b).
(i) Cover the lateral surface of a cuboidal duster (which your teacher uses in the
class room) using a strip of brown sheet of paper, such that it just fits around the
surface. Remove the paper. Measure the area of the paper. Is it the lateral surface
area of the duster?

(a) the total surface area of the room, ignoring the area of windows and doors.
(b) the lateral surface area of  this room.
(c) the total area of the room which is to be white washed.

lateral surface area + 2 × area of base?
2. If we interchange the lengths of the base and the height
of a cuboid (Fig 11.33(i)) to get another cuboid

Of course it is rectangular in shape. When you tape the parts of this cylinder together,

Is 2πr = length of the strip. Check if the area of rectangular strip is 2πrh. Count
how many square units of the squared paper are used to form the cylinder.
Check if this count is approximately equal to 2πr (r + h).
(ii) We can deduce the relation 2πr (r + h) as the surface area of a cylinder in another
way. Imagine cutting up a cylinder as shown below (Fig 11.40).
Fig 11.40
The lateral (or curved) surface area of a cylinder is 2πrh.

Find total surface area of the following cylinders (Fig 11.41)

of cuboid?
Example 4: An aquarium is in the form of a cuboid whose external measures are
80 cm × 30 cm × 40 cm. The base, side faces and back face are to be covered with a

Solution:
The length of the aquarium = l = 80 cm
Width of the aquarium = b = 30 cm
Note: We take π to be
unless otherwise stated.
MENSURATION  185
Height of the aquarium = h = 40 cm
Area of the base = l × b = 80 × 30 = 2400 cm2
Area of the side face = b × h = 30 × 40 = 1200 cm2
Area of the back face = l × h = 80 × 40 = 3200 cm2
Required area = Area of the base + area of the back face
+ (2 × area of a side face)
= 2400 + 3200 + (2 × 1200) = 8000 cm2
Hence the area of the coloured paper required is 8000 cm2.
Example 5: The internal measures of a cuboidal room are 12 m × 8 m × 4 m. Find the
total cost of whitewashing all four walls of a room, if the cost of white washing is ` 5 per
m2. What will be the cost of white washing if the ceiling of the room is also whitewashed.
Solution:
Let the length of the room  = l = 12 m
Width of the room = b = 8 m
Height of the room = h = 4 m
Area of the four walls of the room = Perimeter of the base × Height of the room
= 2 (l + b) × h = 2 (12 + 8) × 4
= 2 × 20 × 4 = 160 m2.
Cost of white washing per m2 = ` 5
Hence the total cost of white washing four walls of the room = ` (160 × 5) = ` 800
Area of ceiling is 12 × 8 = 96 m2
Cost of white washing the ceiling = ` (96 × 5) = ` 480
So the total cost of white washing = ` (800 + 480) = ` 1280
Example 6: In a building there are 24 cylindrical pillars. The radius of each pillar
is 28 cm and height is 4 m. Find the total cost of painting the curved surface area of
all pillars at the rate of ` 8 per m2.
Solution: Radius of cylindrical pillar, r = 28 cm = 0.28 m
height, h = 4 m
curved surface area of a cylinder = 2πrh
curved surface area of a pillar =
= 7.04 m2
curved surface area of 24 such pillar = 7.04 × 24 = 168.96 m2
cost of painting an area of 1 m2 = ` 8
Therefore, cost of painting 1689.6 m2 = 168.96 × 8 = ` 1351.68
Example 7: Find the height of a cylinder whose radius is 7 cm and the
total surface area is 968 cm2.
Solution: Let height of the cylinder = h,  radius = r = 7cm
Total surface area = 2πr (h + r)
MATHEMATICS
i.e.,
2 × 22
7 × 7 × (7 + h) = 968
h = 15 cm
Hence, the height of the cylinder is 15 cm.

11.8  Volume of Cube, Cuboid and Cylinder
Amount of space occupied by a three dimensional object is called its volume. Try to
compare the volume of objects surrounding you. For example, volume of a room is greater
than the volume of an almirah kept inside it. Similarly, volume of your pencil box is greater
than the volume of the pen and the eraser kept inside it.
Can you measure volume of either of these objects?
Remember, we use square units to find the area of a
region. Here we will use cubic units to find the volume of a
solid, as cube is the most convenient solid shape (just as
square is the most convenient shape to measure area of a
region).
For finding the area we divide the region into square
units, similarly, to find the volume of a solid we need to
divide it into cubical units.
Observe that the volume of each of the adjoining solids is
8 cubic units (Fig 11.42 ).
We can say that the volume of a solid is measured by
counting the number of unit cubes it contains. Cubic units which we generally use to measure
volume are
1 cubic cm = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm3
= 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm = ............... mm3
1 cubic m = 1 m × 1 m × 1 m = 1 m3
= ............................... cm3
1 cubic mm = 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm = 1 mm3
= 0.1 cm × 0.1 cm × 0.1 cm = ...................... cm3
We now find some expressions to find volume of a cuboid, cube and cylinder. Let us
take each solid one by one.
11.8.1  Cuboid

You can arrange them in many ways. Observe the following table and fill in the blanks.

What do you observe?
Since we have used 36 cubes to form these cuboids, volume of each cuboid
is 36 cubic units. Also volume of each cuboid is equal to the product of length,
breadth and height of the cuboid. From the above example we can say volume of cuboid
= l × b × h. Since l × b is the area of its base we can also say that,
Volume of cuboid = area of the base × height
Take a sheet of paper. Measure its
area. Pile up such sheets of paper
of same size to make a cuboid
(Fig 11.43). Measure the height of
this pile. Find the volume of the
cuboid by finding the product of
the area of the sheet and the height
of this pile of sheets.
This activity illustrates the idea
that volume of a solid can be deduced by this method also (if the base and top of the
solid are congruent and parallel to each other and its edges are perpendicular to the
base). Can you think of such objects whose volume can be found by using this method?

which has the same volume but is more economical than these?
11.8.3  Cylinder
We know that volume of a cuboid can be found by finding the
product of area of base and its height. Can we find the volume of
a cylinder in the same way?
Just like cuboid, cylinder has got a top and a base which are
congruent and parallel to each other. Its lateral surface is also
perpendicular to the base, just like cuboid.
the Volume of a cuboid = area of base × height
= l  × b × h = lbh

11.9  Volume and Capacity
There is not much difference between these two words.
(a) Volume refers to the amount of space occupied by an object.
(b) Capacity refers to the quantity that a container holds.
Note: If a water tin holds 100 cm3 of water then the capacity of the water tin is 100 cm3.
Capacity is also measured in terms of litres. The relation between litre and cm3 is,
1 mL = 1 cm3,1 L = 1000 cm3. Thus, 1 m3 = 1000000 cm3 = 1000 L.
Example 8: Find the height of a cuboid whose volume is 275 cm3 and base area
is 25 cm2 .
Solution:
Volume of a cuboid = Base area × Height
Hence height of the cuboid = Volume of cuboid
Base area
= 275
25  = 11 cm
Height of  the cuboid is 11 cm.
Example 9: A godown is in the form of a cuboid of measures 60 m × 40 m × 30 m.
How many cuboidal boxes can be stored in it if the volume of one box is 0.8 m3 ?
Solution:
Volume of  one box = 0.8 m3
Volume of godown = 60 × 40 × 30 = 72000 m3
Number of boxes that can be stored in the godown = Volume of the godown
Volume of one box
= 60× 40× 30
= 90,000
Hence the number of cuboidal boxes that can be stored in the godown is 90,000.
Example 10: A rectangular paper of  width 14 cm is rolled along its width and a cylinder
of radius 20 cm is formed. Find the volume of the cylinder (Fig 11.45). (Take 22
7  for π)
Solution: A cylinder is formed by rolling a rectangle about its width. Hence the width
of  the paper becomes height and radius of the cylinder is 20 cm.

Height of the cylinder = h = 14 cm
Radius = r = 20 cm

Volume of the cylinder = V = π r2 h

Hence, the volume of the cylinder is 17600 cm3.
Example 11: A rectangular piece of paper 11 cm × 4 cm is folded without overlapping
to make a cylinder of height 4 cm. Find the volume of  the cylinder.
Solution: Length of  the paper becomes the perimeter of the base of the cylinder and
width becomes height.
Let radius of the cylinder = r and height = h
Perimeter of the base of the cylinder = 2πr = 11
Therefore,
r = 7
4  cm
Volume of the cylinder = V = πr2h
cm3 = 38.5 cm3.
Hence the volume of the cylinder is 38.5 cm3.

12.4.1  Comparing very large and very small numbers
The diameter of the Sun is 1.4 × 109 m and the diameter of the Earth is 1.2756 × 107 m.
Suppose you want to compare the diameter of the Earth, with the diameter of the Sun.
Diameter of the Sun = 1.4 × 109 m
Diameter of the earth = 1.2756 × 107 m
Therefore
1.4 10
1.2756 10
1.4 10
1.2756
1.2756
which is approximately 100
So, the diameter of the Sun is about 100 times the diameter of the earth.
Let us compare the size of a Red Blood cell which is 0.000007 m to that of a plant cell which
is 0.00001275 m.
Size of Red Blood cell = 0.000007 m = 7 × 10– 6 m
Size of plant cell = 0.00001275 = 1.275 × 10– 5 m
Therefore,

So a red blood cell is half of plant cell in size.
Mass of earth is 5.97 × 1024 kg and mass of moon is 7.35 × 1022 kg. What is the
total mass?
Total mass = 5.97 × 1024 kg + 7.35 × 1022 kg.
= 5.97 × 100 × 1022 + 7.35 × 1022
= 597 × 1022 + 7.35 × 1022
= (597 + 7.35) × 1022
= 604.35 × 1022 kg.
The distance between Sun and Earth is 1.496 × 1011m and the distance between

MATHEMATICS
Distance between Sun and Earth = 1.496 × 1011m
Distance between Earth and Moon = 3.84 × 108m
Distance between Sun and Moon = 1.496 × 1011 – 3.84 × 108
= 1.496 × 1000 × 108  – 3.84 × 108
= (1496 – 3.84) × 108 m = 1492.16 × 108 m

DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTIONS  201
13.1  Introduction
Mohan prepares tea for himself and his sister. He uses 300 mL of
water, 2 spoons of sugar, 1 spoon of tea leaves and 50 mL of milk.
How much quantity of each item will he need, if he has to make tea
for five persons?
If two students take 20 minutes to arrange chairs for an assembly,
then how much time would five students take to do the same job?
We come across many such situations in our day-to-day life, where we
need to see variation in one quantity bringing in variation in the other
quantity.
For example:
(i) If the number of articles purchased increases, the total cost also increases.
(ii) More the money deposited in a bank, more is the interest earned.
(iii) As the speed of a vehicle increases, the time taken to cover the same distance
decreases.
(iv) For a given job, more the number of workers, less will be the time taken to complete
the work.
Observe that change in one quantity leads to change in the other quantity.
Write five more such situations where change in one quantity leads to change in
another quantity.
How do we find out the quantity of each item needed by Mohan? Or, the time five
students take to complete the job?
To answer such questions, we now study some concepts of variation.
13.2 Direct Proportion
If the cost of 1 kg of sugar is  ` 18, then what would be the cost of 3 kg sugar? It is ` 54.
Direct and Inverse
Proportions
CHAPTER
MATHEMATICS
Similarly, we can find the cost of 5 kg or 8 kg of sugar. Study the following table.
Observe that as weight of sugar increases, cost also increases in such a manner that
their ratio remains constant.
Take one more example. Suppose a car uses 4 litres of petrol to travel a distance of
60 km. How far will it travel using 12 litres? The answer is 180 km. How did we calculate
it? Since petrol consumed in the second instance is 12 litres, i.e., three times of 4 litres, the
distance travelled will also be three times of 60 km. In other words, when the petrol
consumption becomes three-fold, the distance travelled is also three fold the previous
one. Let the consumption of petrol be x litres and the corresponding distance travelled be
y km . Now, complete the following table:
Petrol in litres (x)
Distance in km (y)
We find that as the value of x increases, value of y also increases in such a way that the
ratio x
does not change; it remains constant (say k). In this case, it is 1
15  (check it!).
We say that x and y are in direct proportion, if
or x = ky.
In this example, 4
, where 4 and 12 are the quantities of petrol consumed in
litres (x) and 60 and 180 are the distances (y) in km. So when x and y are in direct
proportion, we can write
. [y1, y2 are values of y corresponding to the values x1,
x2 of x respectively]
The consumption of petrol and the distance travelled by a car is a case of direct
proportion. Similarly, the total amount spent and the number of articles purchased is also
an example of direct proportion.
DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTIONS  203
DO THIS
Think of a few more examples for direct proportion. Check whether Mohan [in the initial example] will
take 750 mL of water, 5 spoons of sugar,
2 2  spoons of tea leaves and 125 mL of milk to prepare tea for
five persons! Let us try to understand further the concept of direct proportion through the following activities.
(i) •
Take a clock and fix its minute hand at 12.
Record the angle turned through by the minute hand from its original position
and the time that has passed, in the following table:
Time Passed (T)
(in minutes)
Angle turned (A)
(in degree)
What do you observe about T and A? Do they increase together?
Is  T
A  same every time?
Is the angle turned through by the minute hand directly proportional
to the time that has passed? Yes!
From the above table, you can also see
T1 : T2 = A1 : A2 , because
T1 : T2 = 15 : 30
= 1:2
A1 : A2 = 90 : 180
= 1:2
Check if
T2 : T3 =  A2 : A3  and  T3 : T4  = A3 : A4
You can repeat this activity by choosing your own time interval.
(ii) Ask your friend to fill the following table and find the ratio of his age to the
corresponding age of his mother.
Present
five years ago
after five years
Friend’s age (F)
Mother’s age (M)
What do you observe?
Do F and M increase (or decrease) together? Is F
M  same every time? No!
You can repeat this activity with other friends and write down your observations.
MATHEMATICS
TRY THESE
Thus, variables increasing (or decreasing) together need not always be in direct
proportion. For example:
(i) physical changes in human beings occur with time but not necessarily in a predeter-
mined ratio.
(ii) changes in weight and height among individuals are not in any known proportion and
(iii)  there is no direct relationship or ratio between the height of a tree and the number
of leaves growing on its branches. Think of some more similar examples.
1. Observe the following tables and find if x and y are directly proportional.
(iii)
2. Principal = ` 1000, Rate = 8% per annum. Fill in the following table and find
which type of interest (simple or compound) changes in direct proportion with
time period.
Time period
1 year
2 years
3 years
Simple Interest (in `)
Compound Interest (in `)
If we fix time period and the rate of interest, simple interest changes proportionally
with principal. Would there be a similar relationship for compound interest? Why?
Let us consider some solved examples where we would use the concept of
direct proportion.
Example 1: The cost of 5 metres of a particular quality of cloth is ` 210. Tabulate the
cost of 2, 4, 10 and 13 metres of cloth of the same type.
Solution: Suppose the length of cloth is x metres and its cost, in `, is y.
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTIONS  205
As the length of cloth increases, cost of the cloth also increases in the same ratio. It is
a case of direct proportion.
We make use of the relation of type
(i) Here x1 = 5,  y1 = 210 and x2 = 2
Therefore,
gives
or 5y2 = 2 × 210 or
(ii) If x3 = 4, then
or 5y3 = 4 × 210 or
= 168
[Can we use
here? Try!]
(iii) If x4 = 10, then
= 420
(iv) If x5 = 13, then
= 546
Note that here we can also use
in the place of
Example 2: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the
height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
Solution: Let the height of the tree be x metres. We form a table as shown below:
height of the object (in metres)
length of the shadow (in metres)
Note that more the height of an object, the more would be the length of its shadow.
Hence, this is a case of direct proportion. That is,
We have
10  = 15
x    (Why?)
21 = x
Thus, height of the tree is 21 metres.
Alternately, we can write
MATHEMATICS
x1 : x2 = y1 : y2
14 : x = 10 : 15
Therefore,
10 × x = 15 × 14
x = 15
Example 3: If the weight of 12 sheets of thick paper is 40 grams, how many sheets of
the same paper would weigh
2 2  kilograms?
Solution:
Let the number of sheets which weigh
2 2  kg be x. We put the above information in
the form of a table as shown below:
Number of sheets
Weight of sheets (in grams)
More the number of sheets, the more would their
weight be. So, the number of sheets and their weights
are directly proportional to each other.
40  = 2500
750 = x
Thus, the required number of sheets of paper = 750.
Alternate method:
Two quantities x and y which vary in direct proportion have the relation x = ky or
Here,
number of sheets
weight of sheets in grams  = 12
Now x is the number of sheets of the paper which weigh
2 2  kg [2500 g].
Using the relation x = ky,  x = 3
10  × 2500 = 750
Thus, 750 sheets of paper would weigh
2 2  kg.
Example 4: A train is moving at a uniform speed of 75 km/hour.
(i) How far will it travel in 20 minutes?
(ii)  Find the time required to cover a distance of 250 km.
Solution: Let the distance travelled (in km)  in 20 minutes be x and time taken
(in minutes) to cover 250 km be y.
Distance travelled (in km)
Time taken (in minutes)
1 kilogram = 1000 grams
2  kilograms = 2500 grams
1 hour = 60 minutes
DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTIONS  207
DO THIS
Since the speed is uniform, therefore, the distance covered would be directly
proportional to time.
(i) We have 75
x = 25
So, the train will cover a distance of 25 km in 20 minutes.
(ii) Also,
= 200 minutes or 3 hours  20 minutes.
Therefore, 3 hours 20 minutes will be required to cover a distance of 250 kilometres.
Alternatively, when x is known, then one can determine y from the relation
You know that a map is a miniature representation of a very large region. A scale is
usually given at the bottom of the map. The scale shows a relationship between
actual length and the length represented on the map. The scale of  the map is thus the
ratio of the distance between two points on the map to the actual distance between
two points on the large region.
For example, if 1 cm on the map represents 8 km of actual distance [i.e., the scale is
1 cm :  8 km or 1 : 800,000] then 2 cm on the same map will represent 16 km.
Hence, we can say that scale of a map is based on the concept of direct proportion.
Example 5: The scale of a map is given as 1:30000000. Two cities are 4 cm apart on
the map. Find the actual distance between them.
Solution: Let the map distance be x cm and actual distance be y cm, then
1:30000000 = x : y
Since
x = 4    so,
y = 4 × 3 × 107 = 12 × 107 cm = 1200 km.
Thus, two cities, which are 4 cm apart on the map, are actually 1200 km away from
each other.
Take a map of your State. Note the scale used there. Using a ruler, measure the “map
distance” between any two cities. Calculate the actual distance between them.

THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
Take a few problems discussed so far under ‘direct variation’. Do you think that
they can be solved by ‘unitary method’?
13.3 Inverse Proportion
Two quantities may change in such a manner that if one quantity increases, the other
quantity decreases and vice versa. For example, as the number of workers increases, time
taken to finish the job decreases. Similarly, if we increase the speed, the time taken to
cover a given distance decreases.
To understand this, let us look into the following situation.
Zaheeda can go to her school in four different ways. She can walk, run, cycle or go by
car. Study the following table.
MATHEMATICS
Observe that as the speed increases, time taken to cover the same distance decreases.
As Zaheeda doubles her speed by running, time
reduces to half. As she increases her speed to three
times by cycling, time decreases to one third.
Similarly, as she increases her speed to 15 times,
time decreases to one fifteenth. (Or, in other words
the ratio by which time decreases is inverse of the
ratio by which the corresponding speed increases).
Can we say that speed and time change inversely
in proportion?
Let us consider another example. A school wants to spend ` 6000 on mathematics
textbooks. How many books could be bought at ` 40 each? Clearly 150 books can be
bought. If the price of a textbook is more than ` 40, then the number of books which
could be purchased with the same amount of money would be less than 150. Observe the
following table.
Price of each book (in `)
Number of books that
can be bought
What do you observe? You will appreciate that as the price of the books increases,
the number of books that can be bought, keeping the fund constant, will decrease.
Ratio by which the price of books increases when going from 40 to 50 is 4 : 5, and the
ratio by which the corresponding number of books decreases from 150 to 120 is 5 : 4.
This means that the two ratios are inverses of each other.
Notice that the product of the corresponding values of the two quantities is constant;
that is, 40 × 150 = 50 × 120 = 6000.
If we represent the price of one book as x and the number of books bought as y, then
as x increases y decreases and vice-versa. It is important to note that the product xy
remains constant. We say that x varies inversely with y and y varies inversely with x. Thus
two quantities x and y are said to vary in inverse proportion, if there exists a relation
of the type xy = k between them, k being a constant. If y1, y2 are the values of y
corresponding to the values x1, x2 of x respectively then x1y1 = x2y2 (= k), or
We say that x and y are in inverse proportion.
Hence, in this example, cost of a book and number of books purchased in a fixed
amount are inversely proportional. Similarly, speed of a vehicle and the time taken to
cover a fixed distance changes in inverse proportion.
Think of more such examples of pairs of quantities that vary in inverse proportion. You
may now have a look at the furniture – arranging problem, stated in the introductory part
of this chapter.
Here is an activity for better understanding of the inverse proportion.
Multiplicative inverse of a number

Example 7:  6 pipes are required to fill a tank in 1 hour 20 minutes. How long will it
take if only 5 pipes of the same type are used?
Solution:
Let the desired time to fill the tank be x minutes. Thus, we have
the following table.
Number of pipes
Time (in minutes)
Lesser the number of pipes, more will be the time required by
it to fill the tank. So, this is a case of inverse proportion.
Hence,
80 × 6 = x × 5
[x1 y1 = x2 y2]
x = 96
Thus, time taken to fill the tank by 5 pipes  is 96 minutes or 1 hour 36 minutes.
Example 8:  There are 100 students in a hostel. Food provision for them is for 20
days. How long will these provisions last, if 25 more students join the group?
Solution:  Suppose the provisions last for y days when the number of students is 125.
We have the following table.
Number of students
Number of days
Note that more the number of students, the sooner would
the provisions exhaust. Therefore, this is a case of inverse
proportion.
100 × 20 = 125 × y
= y    or
16 = y
Thus, the provisions will last for 16 days, if 25 more students join the hostel.
Alternately, we can write x1 y1 = x2 y2     as
That is,
x1 : x2 = y2 : y1
100 : 125 = y : 20
y = 100
Example 9: If 15 workers can build a wall in 48 hours, how many workers will be
required to do the same work in 30 hours?
Solution:
Let the number of workers employed to build the wall in 30 hours be y.
DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTIONS  213
We have the following table.
Number of hours
Number of workers
Obviously more the number of workers, faster will they build the wall.
So, the number of hours and number of workers vary in inverse proportion.
48 × 15 = 30 × y
Therefore,
48 15
= y         or         y = 24
i.e., to finish the work in 30 hours, 24 workers are required.

FACTORISATION  217
14.1  Introduction
14.1.1  Factors of natural numbers
You will remember what you learnt about factors in Class VI. Let us take a natural number,
say 30, and write it as a product of other natural numbers, say
30 = 2 × 15
= 3 × 10 = 5 × 6
Thus, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30 are the factors of 30.
Of these, 2, 3 and 5 are the prime factors of 30 (Why?)
A number written as a product of prime factors is said to
be in the prime factor form; for example, 30 written as
2 × 3 × 5 is in the prime factor form.
The prime factor form of 70 is 2 × 5 × 7.
The prime factor form of 90 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5, and so on.
Similarly, we can express algebraic expressions as products of their factors.  This is
what we shall learn to do in this chapter.
14.1.2  Factors of algebraic expressions
We have seen in Class VII that in algebraic expressions, terms are formed as products of
factors. For example, in the algebraic expression 5xy + 3x the term 5xy has been formed
by the factors 5, x and y, i.e.,
5xy =
Observe that the factors 5, x and y of 5xy cannot further
be expressed as a product of factors. We may say that 5,
x and y are ‘prime’ factors of 5xy.  In algebraic expressions,
we use the word ‘irreducible’ in place of ‘prime’.  We say that
5 × x × y is the irreducible form of 5xy.  Note 5 × (xy) is not
an irreducible form of  5xy, since the factor xy can be further
expressed as a product of x and y, i.e., xy = x × y.
Factorisation
CHAPTER
Note 1 is a factor of 5xy, since
5xy =
In fact, 1 is a factor of every term. As
in the case of natural numbers, unless
it is specially required, we do not show
1 as a separate factor of any term.
We know that 30 can also be written as
30 = 1 × 30
Thus, 1 and 30 are also factors of 30.
You will notice that 1 is a factor of any
number.  For example, 101 = 1 × 101.
However, when we write a number as a
product of factors, we shall not write 1 as
a factor, unless it is specially required.
MATHEMATICS
Next consider the expression 3x (x + 2).  It can be written as a product of factors.
3, x and (x + 2)
3x(x + 2) =
The factors 3, x and (x +2) are irreducible factors of 3x (x + 2).
Similarly, the expression 10x (x + 2) (y + 3) is expressed in its irreducible factor form
as  10x (x + 2) (y + 3) =
14.2  What is Factorisation?
When we factorise an algebraic expression, we write it as a product of factors.  These
factors may be numbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.
Expressions like 3xy,
, 2x (y + 2), 5 (y + 1) (x + 2) are already in factor form.
Their factors can be just read off from them, as we already know.
On the other hand consider expressions like 2x + 4, 3x + 3y, x2 + 5x, x2 + 5x + 6.
It is not obvious what their factors are. We need to develop systematic methods to factorise
these expressions, i.e., to find their factors. This is what we shall do now.
14.2.1  Method of common factors
• We begin with a simple example: Factorise 2x + 4.
We shall write each term as a product of irreducible factors;
2x = 2 × x
4 = 2 × 2
Hence
2x + 4 = (2 × x) + (2 × 2)
Notice that factor 2 is common to both the terms.
Observe, by distributive law
2 × (x + 2) = (2 × x) + (2 × 2)
Therefore, we can write
2x + 4 = 2 × (x + 2) = 2 (x + 2)
Thus, the expression 2x + 4 is the same as 2 (x + 2).  Now we can read off its factors:
they are 2 and (x + 2). These factors are irreducible.
Next, factorise 5xy + 10x.
The irreducible factor forms of 5xy and 10x are respectively,
5xy = 5 × x × y
10x = 2 × 5 × x
Observe that the two terms have 5 and x as common factors.  Now,
5xy + 10x = (5 × x × y)  + (5 × x × 2)
= (5x × y)  + (5x × 2)
We combine the two terms using the distributive law,
(5x× y) + (5x× 2) = 5x × ( y + 2)
Therefore, 5xy + 10x = 5 x (y + 2). (This is the desired factor form.)
FACTORISATION  219
TRY THESE
Example 1: Factorise  12a2b + 15ab2
Solution: We have
12a2b = 2 × 2 × 3 × a × a × b
15ab2 = 3 × 5 × a × b × b
The two terms have 3, a and b as common factors.
Therefore,
12a2b + 15ab2 = (3 × a × b × 2 × 2 × a) + (3 × a × b × 5 × b)
= 3 × a × b × [(2 × 2 × a) + (5 × b)]
= 3ab × (4a + 5b)
= 3ab (4a + 5b)
(required factor form)
Example 2: Factorise 10x2 – 18x3 + 14x4
Solution:
10x2 = 2 × 5 × x × x
18x3  = 2 × 3 × 3 × x × x × x
14x4 = 2 × 7 × x × x × x × x
The common factors of the three terms are 2, x and x.
Therefore, 10x2 – 18x3 + 14x4 = (2 × x × x × 5) – (2 × x × x × 3 × 3 × x)
+ (2 × x × x × 7 × x × x)
= 2 × x × x ×[(5 – (3 × 3 × x) + (7 × x × x)]
= 2x2  ×  (5 – 9x + 7x2) =
Factorise:
(i)  12x + 36
(ii)  22y – 33z (iii)  14pq + 35pqr
14.2.2  Factorisation by regrouping terms
Look at the expression 2xy + 2y + 3x + 3.  You will notice that the first two terms have
common factors 2 and y and the last two terms have a common factor 3.  But there is no
single factor common to all the terms.  How shall we proceed?
Let us write (2xy + 2y) in the factor form:
2xy + 2y = (2 × x × y) + (2 × y)
= (2 × y × x) + (2 × y × 1)
= (2y × x) + (2y × 1) = 2y (x + 1)
Similarly,
3x + 3 = (3 × x) + (3 × 1)
= 3 × (x + 1) = 3 ( x + 1)
Hence,
2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 = 2y (x + 1) + 3 (x +1)
Observe, now we have a common factor (x + 1) in both the terms on the right hand
side. Combining the two terms,
2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 = 2y (x + 1) + 3 (x + 1) = (x + 1) (2y + 3)
The expression 2xy + 2y + 3x + 3 is now in the form of a product of factors. Its
factors are (x + 1) and (2y + 3). Note, these factors are irreducible.
Note, we need to
show1 as a factor
here. Why?
Do you notice that the factor
form of an expression has only
one term?
(combining the three terms)
(combining the terms)
MATHEMATICS
What is regrouping?
Suppose, the above expression was given as 2xy + 3 + 2y + 3x; then it will not be easy to
see the factorisation. Rearranging the expression, as 2xy + 2y + 3x + 3, allows us to form
groups (2xy + 2y) and (3x + 3) leading to factorisation. This is regrouping.
Regrouping may be possible in more than one ways. Suppose, we regroup the
expression as: 2xy + 3x + 2y + 3. This will also lead to factors. Let us try:
2xy + 3x + 2y + 3 = 2 × x × y + 3 × x + 2 × y + 3
= x × (2y + 3) + 1 × (2y + 3)
= (2y + 3) (x + 1)
The factors are the same (as they have to be), although they appear in different order.
Example 3: Factorise  6xy – 4y + 6 – 9x.
Solution:
Step 1
Check if there is a common factor among all terms.  There is none.
Step 2
Think of grouping.  Notice that first two terms have a common factor 2y;
6xy – 4y = 2y (3x – 2)
What about the last two terms? Observe them.  If you change their order to
– 9x + 6, the factor ( 3x – 2) will come out;
–9x + 6 = –3 (3x) + 3 (2)
= – 3 (3x – 2)
Step 3
Putting (a) and (b) together,
6xy – 4y + 6 – 9x = 6xy – 4y – 9x + 6
= 2y (3x – 2) – 3 (3x – 2)
= (3x – 2) (2y – 3)
The factors of (6xy – 4y + 6 – 9 x) are (3x – 2) and (2y – 3).

14.2.3  Factorisation using identities
We know that
(a + b)2  = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a – b)2  = a2 – 2ab + b2
(a + b) (a – b)  = a2 – b2
(III)
The following solved examples illustrate how to use these identities for factorisation. What
we do is to observe the given expression. If it has a form that fits the right hand side of one
of the identities, then the expression corresponding to the left hand side of the identity
gives the desired factorisation.
Example 4: Factorise x2 + 8x + 16
Solution: Observe the expression; it has three terms. Therefore, it does not fit
Identity III. Also, it’s first and third terms are perfect squares with a positive sign before
the middle term. So, it is of the form a2 + 2ab + b2 where a = x and b = 4
such that
a2 + 2ab + b2 =  x2 + 2 (x) (4) + 42
= x2 + 8x + 16
Since
a2 + 2ab + b2 = (a + b)2,
by comparison
x2 + 8x + 16 = ( x + 4)2    (the required factorisation)
Example 5: Factorise 4y2 – 12y + 9
Solution: Observe 4y2 = (2y)2, 9 = 32 and 12y = 2 × 3 × (2y)
Therefore,
4y2 – 12y + 9 = (2y)2 – 2 × 3 × (2y) + (3)2
= ( 2y – 3)2
(required factorisation)
Example 6: Factorise  49p2 – 36
Solution: There are two terms; both are squares and the second is negative. The
expression is of the form (a2 – b2). Identity III is applicable here;
49p2  – 36 = (7p)2 – ( 6 )2
= (7p – 6 ) ( 7p + 6) (required factorisation)
Example 7: Factorise a2 – 2ab + b2 – c2
Solution: The first three terms of the given expression form (a – b)2.  The fourth term
is a square.  So the expression can be reduced to a difference of two squares.
Thus,
a2 – 2ab + b2 – c2 = (a – b)2– c2
(Applying Identity II)
= [(a – b) – c) ((a – b) + c)]
(Applying Identity III)
= (a – b – c) (a – b + c)
(required factorisation)
Notice, how we applied two identities one after the other to obtain the required factorisation.
Example 8: Factorise   m4 – 256
Solution: We note
m4 = (m2)2 and 256 = (16) 2
Observe here the given
expression is of the form
a2 – 2ab + b2.
Where a = 2y, and b = 3
with 2ab = 2 × 2y × 3 = 12y.
MATHEMATICS
Thus, the given expression fits Identity III.
Therefore,
m4 – 256 = (m2)2 – (16) 2
= (m2 –16) (m2 +16)
[(using Identity (III)]
Now, (m2 + 16) cannot be factorised further, but (m2 –16) is factorisable again as per
Identity III.
m2–16 = m2 – 42
= (m – 4) (m + 4)
Therefore,
m4 – 256 = (m – 4) (m + 4)  (m2 +16)
14.2.4  Factors of  the form ( x + a) ( x + b)
Let us now discuss how we can factorise expressions in one variable, like x2 + 5x + 6,
y2 – 7y + 12,  z2 – 4z – 12, 3m2 + 9m + 6, etc. Observe that these expressions are not
of  the type (a + b) 2 or (a – b) 2, i.e., they are not perfect squares. For example, in
x2 + 5x + 6, the term 6 is not a perfect square.  These expressions obviously also do not
fit the type (a2 – b2) either.
They, however, seem to be of the type x2 + (a + b) x + a b. We may therefore, try to
use Identity IV studied in the last chapter to factorise these expressions:
(x + a) (x + b) = x2 + (a + b) x + ab
For that we have to look at the coefficients of x and the constant term. Let us see how
it is done in the following example.
Example 9: Factorise x2 + 5x + 6
Solution:  If we compare the R.H.S. of Identity (IV) with x2 + 5x + 6, we find ab = 6,
and a + b = 5. From this, we must obtain a and b. The factors then will be
(x + a) and (x + b).
If  a b  = 6, it means that a and b are factors of 6.  Let us try  a = 6, b = 1. For these
values a + b = 7, and not 5, So this choice is not right.
Let us try  a = 2, b = 3.  For this a + b = 5 exactly as required.
The factorised form of this given expression is then  (x +2) (x + 3).
In general, for factorising an algebraic expression of the type x2 + px + q, we find two
factors a and b of q (i.e., the constant term) such that
ab = q    and     a + b = p
Then, the expression becomes
x2 + (a + b) x + ab
x2 + ax + bx + ab
x(x + a) + b(x + a)
(x + a) (x + b)        which are the required factors.
Example 10: Find the factors of y2 –7y +12.
Solution:  We note 12 = 3 × 4 and 3 + 4 = 7.  Therefore,
y2 – 7y+ 12 = y2 – 3y – 4y + 12
= y (y –3) – 4 (y –3)  = (y –3) (y – 4)
FACTORISATION  223
Note, this time we did not compare the expression with that in Identity (IV) to identify
a and b.  After sufficient practice you may not need to compare the given expressions for
their factorisation with the expressions in the identities; instead you can proceed directly
as we did above.
Example 11: Obtain the factors of z2 – 4z – 12.
Solution: Here a b = –12 ; this means one of a  and b is negative. Further, a + b = – 4,
this means the one with larger numerical value is negative. We try a = – 4, b = 3; but
this will not work, since a + b = –1.  Next possible values are a = – 6, b = 2, so that
a + b = – 4 as required.
Hence,
z2  – 4z –12 = z2  – 6z + 2z –12
= z(z – 6) + 2(z – 6 )
= (z – 6) (z + 2)
Example 12: Find the factors of 3m2 + 9m +  6.
Solution: We notice that 3 is a common factor of all the terms.
Therefore,
3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m2 + 3m + 2)
m 2 + 3m + 2 = m2 + m + 2m + 2
(as 2 = 1 × 2)
= m(m + 1)+ 2( m + 1)
= (m + 1) (m + 2)
Therefore,
3m2 + 9m + 6 = 3(m + 1) (m + 2)

14.3  Division of Algebraic Expressions
We have learnt how to add and subtract algebraic expressions. We also know how to
multiply two expressions. We have not however, looked at division of one algebraic
expression by another. This is what we wish to do in this section.
We recall that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Thus, 7 × 8 = 56 gives
56 ÷ 8 = 7 or 56 ÷ 7 = 8.
We may similarly follow the division of algebraic expressions. For example,
2x × 3x2 = 6x3
Therefore,
6x3 ÷ 2x = 3x2
and also,
6x3 ÷ 3x2 = 2x.
5x (x + 4) = 5x2 + 20x
Therefore,
(5x2 + 20x) ÷ 5x = x + 4
and also
(5x2 + 20x) ÷ (x + 4) = 5x.
We shall now look closely at how the division of one expression by another can be
carried out. To begin with we shall consider the division of a monomial by another monomial.
14.3.1  Division of a monomial by another monomial
Consider  6x3 ÷ 2x
We may write 2x and 6x3 in irreducible factor forms,
2x = 2 × x
6x3 = 2 × 3 × x × x × x
Now we group factors of 6x3 to separate 2x,
6x3 = 2 × x × (3 × x × x) = (2x) × (3x2)
Therefore,
6x3 ÷ 2x = 3x2.
A shorter way to depict cancellation of common factors is as we do in division of numbers:
77 ÷ 7 = 77
7 = 7
Similarly,
6x3 ÷ 2x =
= 3 × x × x = 3x2
Example 13: Do the following divisions.
(i) –20x4 ÷ 10x2
(ii) 7x2y2z2 ÷ 14xyz
Solution:
(i) –20x4 = –2 × 2 × 5 × x × x × x × x
10x2 = 2 × 5 × x × x

TRY THESE
Therefore,
(–20x4) ÷ 10x2 =
= –2 × x × x = –2x2
(ii) 7x2y2z2 ÷ 14xyz
2 xyz
Divide.
(i) 24xy2z3 by 6yz2
(ii) 63a2b4c6 by 7a2b2c3
14.3.2  Division of a polynomial by a monomial
Let us consider the division of the trinomial 4y3 + 5y2 + 6y by the monomial 2y.
4y3 + 5y2 + 6y = (2 × 2 × y × y × y) + (5 × y × y) + (2 × 3 × y)
(Here, we expressed each term of the polynomial in factor form) we find that 2 × y is
common in each term. Therefore, separating 2 × y from each term. We get
4y3 + 5y2 + 6y =2 × y × (2 × y × y) + 2 × y × 5
⎠ + 2 × y × 3
= 2y (2y2) + 2y
⎠ + 2y (3)
⎠  (The common factor 2y is shown separately.
Therefore, (4y3 + 5y2 + 6y)  ÷ 2y
= 2y2 + 5
2 y + 3
Alternatively, we could divide each term of the trinomial by the
monomial using the cancellation method.
(4y3 + 5y2 + 6y) ÷ 2y =
= 2y2 + 5
2 y  + 3
Example 14: Divide 24(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) by 8xyz using both the methods.
Solution: 24 (x2yz + xy2z + xyz2)
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × [(x × x × y × z) + (x × y × y × z) + (x × y × z × z)]
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × x × y × z × (x + y + z) = 8 × 3 × xyz × (x + y + z)
Therefore, 24 (x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) ÷ 8xyz
= 3 × (x + y + z) = 3 (x + y + z)
Here, we divide
each term of the
polynomial in the
numerator by the
monomial in the
denominator.
(By taking out the
common factor)
MATHEMATICS
Alternately,24(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) ÷ 8xyz =
= 3x + 3y + 3z = 3(x + y + z)
14.4 Division of Algebraic Expressions Continued
(Polynomial ÷ Polynomial)
• Consider (7x2 + 14x) ÷ (x + 2)
We shall factorise (7x2 + 14x) first to check and match factors with the denominator:
7x2 + 14x = (7 × x × x) + (2 × 7 × x)
= 7 × x × (x + 2) = 7x(x + 2)
(7x2 + 14x) ÷ (x + 2) =
= 7 (
(Cancelling the factor (x + 2))
Example 15: Divide 44(x4 – 5x3 – 24x2) by 11x (x – 8)
Solution: Factorising 44(x4 – 5x3 – 24x2), we get
44(x4 – 5x3 – 24x2) = 2 × 2 × 11 × x2(x2 – 5x – 24)
(taking the common factor x2 out of the bracket)
= 2 × 2 × 11 × x2(x2 – 8x + 3x – 24)
= 2 × 2 × 11 × x2 [x (x – 8) + 3(x – 8)]
= 2 × 2 × 11 × x2 (x + 3) (x – 8)
Therefore,  44(x4 – 5x3 – 24x2) ÷ 11x(x – 8)
( – 8)
( – 8)
= 2 × 2 × x (x + 3) = 4x(x + 3)
Example 16: Divide z(5z2 – 80) by 5z(z + 4)
Solution: Dividend = z(5z2 – 80)
= z[(5 × z2) – (5 × 16)]
= z × 5 × (z2 – 16)
= 5z × (z + 4) (z – 4)
[using the identity
a2 – b2 = (a + b) (a – b)]
Thus,
z(5z2 – 80) ÷ 5z(z + 4) = 5 (
= (z – 4)
Will it help here to
divide each term of
the numerator by
the binomial in the
denominator?
We cancel the factors 11,
x and (x – 8) common to
both the numerator and
denominator.

we include it in
the sum.
Remember to make
use of brackets,

constant (or a variable) outside, each
term of the expression has to be
multiplied by the constant
(or the variable).

The teacher explains, “ This is so

1. When we factorise an expression, we write it as a product of factors. These factors may be
numbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.
2. An irreducible factor is a factor which cannot be expressed further as a product of factors.
3. A systematic way of factorising an expression is the common factor method. It consists of three
steps: (i) Write each term of the expression as a product of irreducible factors (ii) Look for and
separate the common factors and (iii) Combine the remaining factors in each term in accordance
with the distributive law.
4. Sometimes, all the terms in a given expression do not have a common factor; but the terms can be
grouped in such a way that all the terms in each group have a common factor. When we do this,
there emerges a common factor across all the groups leading to the required factorisation of the
expression. This is the method of regrouping.
5. In factorisation by regrouping, we should remember that any regrouping (i.e., rearrangement) of
the terms in the given expression may not lead to factorisation. We must observe the expression
and come out with the desired regrouping by trial and error.
6. A number of expressions to be factorised are of the form or can be put into the form : a2 + 2 ab + b2,
a2 – 2ab + b2, a2 – b2 and x2 + (a + b) + ab. These expressions can be easily factorised using
Identities I, II, III and IV, given in Chapter 9,
a2 + 2 ab + b2 = (a + b)2
a2 – 2ab + b2 = (a – b)2
a2 – b2 = (a + b) (a – b)
x2 + (a + b) x + ab = (x + a) (x + b)
7. In expressions which have factors of the type (x + a) (x + b), remember the numerical term gives ab. Its
factors, a and b, should be so chosen that their sum, with signs taken care of, is the coefficient of x.
8. We know that in the case of numbers, division is the inverse of multiplication. This idea is applicable
also to the division of algebraic expressions.
MATHEMATICS
9. In the case of division of a polynomial by a monomial, we may carry out the division either by
dividing each term of the polynomial by the monomial or by the common factor method.
10. In the case of division of a polynomial by a polynomial, we cannot proceed by dividing each term
in the dividend polynomial by the divisor polynomial. Instead, we factorise both the polynomials
and cancel their common factors.
11. In the case of divisions of algebraic expressions that we studied in this chapter, we have
Dividend = Divisor × Quotient.
In general, however, the relation is
Dividend = Divisor × Quotient + Remainder
Thus, we have considered in the present chapter only those divisions in which the remainder
is zero.
12. There are many errors students commonly make when solving algebra exercises. You should avoid
making such errors.

15.1  Introduction
Have you seen graphs in the newspapers, television, magazines, books etc.? The purpose
of the graph is to show numerical facts in visual form so that they can be understood
quickly, easily and clearly. Thus graphs are visual representations of data collected. Data
can also be presented in the form of a table; however a graphical presentation is easier to
understand. This is true in particular when there is a trend or comparison to be shown.
We have already seen some types of graphs. Let us quickly recall them here.
15.1.1  A Bar graph
A bar graph is used to show comparison among categories. It may consist of two or more
parallel vertical (or horizontal) bars (rectangles).
The bar graph in Fig 15.1 shows Anu’s mathematics marks in the three terminal
examinations. It helps you to compare her performance easily. She has shown good progress.
Fig 15.1
Bar graphs can also have double bars as in Fig 15.2. This graph gives a comparative
account of sales (in `) of various fruits over a two-day period. How is Fig 15.2 different
from Fig 15.1? Discuss with your friends.

15.1.2  A Pie graph (or a circle-graph)
A pie-graph is used to compare parts of a whole. The circle represents the whole. Fig 15.3
is a pie-graph. It shows the percentage of viewers watching different types of TV channels.
15.1.3  A histogram
A Histogram is a bar graph that shows data in intervals. It has adjacent bars over
the intervals.

INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS  233
The histogram in Fig 15.4 illustrates the distribution of weights (in kg) of 40 persons of
a locality.

There are no gaps between bars, because there are no gaps between the intervals.
What is the information that you gather from this histogram? Try to list them out.
15.1.4  A line graph
A line graph displays data that changes continuously over periods of time.
When Renu fell sick, her doctor maintained a record of her body temperature, taken
every four hours. It was in the form of a graph (shown in Fig 15.5 and Fig 15.6).
We may call this a “time-temperature graph”.
It is a pictorial representation of the following data, given in tabular form.
6 a.m.
10 a.m.
2 p.m.
6 p.m.
Temperature(°C)
The horizontal line (usually called the x-axis) shows the timings at which the temperatures
were recorded. What are labelled on the vertical line (usually called the y-axis)?
In Fig 15.4 a jagged line

horizontal line to indicate
that we are not showing
numbers between 0 and 40.

The points are then connected by line
by a point on the square grid.
segments. The result is the line graph.
What all does this graph tell you? For example you can see the pattern of temperature;
more at 10 a.m. (see Fig 15.5) and then decreasing till 6 p.m. Notice that the temperature
increased by 3° C(= 40° C – 37° C) during the period 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.
There was no recording of temperature at 8 a.m., however the graph suggests that it
was more than 37 °C (How?).
Example 1: (A graph on “performance”)
The given graph (Fig 15.7) represents the total runs scored by two batsmen A and B,
during each of the ten different matches in the year 2007. Study the graph and answer the
following questions.
(i) What information is given on the two axes?
(ii) Which line shows the runs scored by batsman A?
(iii) Were the run scored by them same in any match in 2007? If so, in which match?
(iii) Among the two batsmen, who is steadier? How do you judge it?
Solution:
(i) The horizontal axis (or the x-axis) indicates the matches played during the year
2007. The vertical axis (or the y-axis) shows the total runs scored in each match.
(ii) The dotted line shows the runs scored by Batsman A. (This is already indicated at
the top of the graph).
INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS  235
(iii) During the 4th match, both have scored the same
number of 60 runs. (This is indicated by the point
at which both graphs meet).
(iv) Batsman A has one great “peak” but many deep
“valleys”. He does not appear to be  consistent.
B, on the other hand has never scored below a
total of 40 runs, even though his highest score is
only 100 in comparison to 115 of A. Also A has
scored a zero in two matches and in a total of 5
matches he has scored less than 40 runs. Since A
has a lot of ups and downs, B is a more consistent
and reliable batsman.
Example 2:  The given graph (Fig 15.8) describes
the distances of a car from a city P at different times
when it is travelling from City P to City Q, which are
350 km apart. Study the graph and answer the following:
(i) What information is given on the two axes?
(ii) From where and when did the car begin its
journey?
(iii) How far did the car go in the first hour?
(iv) How far did the car go during (i) the 2nd hour? (ii) the 3rd hour?
(v) Was the speed same during the first three hours? How do you know it?
(vi) Did the car stop for some duration at any place? Justify your answer.
(vii) When did the car reach City Q?
Fig 15.7
Fig 15.8
236  MATHEMATICS
Solution:
(i) The horizontal (x) axis shows the time. The vertical (y) axis shows the distance of the
car from City P.
(ii) The car started from City P at 8 a.m.
(iii) The car travelled 50 km during the first hour. [This can be seen as follows.
At 8 a.m. it just started from City P. At 9 a.m. it was at the 50th km (seen from graph).
Hence during the one-hour time between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. the car travelled 50 km].
(iv) The distance covered by the car during
(a) the 2nd hour (i.e., from 9 am to 10 am) is 100 km, (150 – 50).
(b) the 3rd hour (i.e., from 10 am to 11 am) is 50 km (200 – 150).
(v) From the answers to questions (iii) and (iv), we find that the speed of the car was not
the same all the time. (In fact the graph illustrates how the speed varied).
(vi) We find that the car was 200 km away from city P when the time was 11 a.m. and
also at 12 noon. This shows that the car did not travel during the interval 11 a.m. to
12 noon. The horizontal line segment representing “travel” during this period is
illustrative of this fact.
(vii) The car reached City Q at 2 p.m.

15.2  Linear Graphs
A line graph consists of bits of line segments
joined consecutively. Sometimes the graph may
be a whole unbroken line. Such a graph is called
a linear graph. To draw such a line we need to
locate some points on the graph sheet. We will
now learn how to locate points conveniently on
a graph sheet.
15.2.1  Location of a point
The teacher put a dot on the black-board. She asked the
students how they would describe its location. There were
several responses (Fig 15. 9).
The dot is
very close to
the left
upper corner
of board
The dot is
near the left
edge of the
board
Fig 15.9
The dot is
in the upper
half of the
board
Can any one of these statements help fix the position of the dot? No! Why not?
Think about it.
John then gave a suggestion. He measured the distance of the dot from the left edge of
the board and said, “The dot is 90 cm from the left edge of the board”. Do you think
John’s suggestion is really helpful? (Fig 15.10)
Fig 15.10
Fig 15.11
A, A1, A2, A3 are all 90 cm away
A is 90 cm from left edge and
from the left edge.
160 cm from the bottom edge.
INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS  241
Rekha then came up with a modified statement : “The dot is 90 cm from the left edge
and 160 cm from the bottom edge”. That solved the problem completely! (Fig 15.11) The
teacher said, “We describe the position of this dot by writing it as (90, 160)”. Will the point
(160, 90) be different from (90, 160)? Think about it.
The 17th century mathematician Rene Descartes, it is said, noticed the movement
of an insect near a corner of the ceiling and began to think of determining the
position of a given point in a plane. His system of fixing a point with the help of
two measurements, vertical and horizontal, came to be known as Cartesian system,
in his honour.
15.2.2  Coordinates
Suppose you go to an auditorium and
search for your reserved seat. You need to
know two numbers, the row number and
the seat number. This is the basic method
for fixing a point in a plane.
Observe in Fig 15.12 how the point
(3, 4) which is 3 units from left edge and 4
units from bottom edge is plotted on a graph
sheet. The graph sheet itself is a square grid.
We draw the x and y axes conveniently and
then fix the required point. 3 is called the
x-coordinate of the point; 4 is the
y-coordinate of the point. We say that the
coordinates of the point are (3, 4).
Example 3: Plot the point (4, 3) on a graph
sheet. Is it the same as the point (3, 4)?
Solution: Locate the x, y axes, (they are
actually number lines!). Start at O (0, 0).
Move 4 units to the right; then move 3 units
up, you reach the point (4, 3). From
Fig 15.13, you can see that the points (3, 4)
and (4, 3) are two different points.
Example 4: From Fig 15.14, choose the
letter(s) that indicate the location of the points
given below:
(i) (2, 1)
(ii) (0, 5)
(iii) (2, 0)

15.3  Some Applications
In everyday life, you might have observed that the more you use a facility, the more you
pay for it. If more electricity is consumed, the bill is bound to be high. If less electricity is
used, then the bill will be easily manageable. This is an instance where one quantity affects
another. Amount of electric bill depends on the quantity of electricity used. We say that the
quantity of electricity is an independent variable (or sometimes control variable) and
the amount of electric bill is the dependent variable. The relation between such variables
can be shown through a graph.

(v) Join the points.
We find that the graph is a line. (It is a linear graph). Why does this graph pass through
the origin? Think about it.
This graph can help us to estimate a few things. Suppose we want to find the amount
needed to buy 12 litres of petrol. Locate 12 on the horizontal axis.
Follow the vertical line through 12 till you meet the graph at P (say).
From P you take a horizontal line to meet the vertical axis. This meeting point provides
the answer.
This is the graph of a situation in which two quantities, are in direct variation. (How ?).
In such situations, the graphs will always be linear.
In the above example, use the graph to find how much petrol can be purchased
for ` 800.

16.1  Introduction
You have studied various types of numbers such as natural numbers, whole numbers,
integers and rational numbers. You have also studied a number of interesting properties
about them. In Class VI, we explored finding factors and multiples and the relationships
among them.
In this chapter, we will explore numbers in more detail. These ideas help in justifying
tests of divisibility.
16.2  Numbers in General Form
Let us take the number 52 and write it as
52 = 50 + 2 = 10 × 5 + 2
Similarly, the number 37 can be written as
37 = 10 × 3 + 7
In general, any two digit number ab made of digits a and b can be written as
ab = 10 × a + b = 10a + b
What about ba?
ba = 10 × b + a = 10b + a
Let us now take number 351. This is a three digit number. It can also be written as
351 = 300 + 50 + 1 = 100 × 3 + 10 × 5 + 1 × 1
Similarly
497 = 100 × 4 + 10 × 9 + 1 × 7
In general, a 3-digit number abc made up of digits a, b and c is written as
abc = 100 × a + 10 × b + 1 × c
= 100a + 10b + c
In the same way,
cab = 100c + 10a + b
bca = 100b + 10c + a
and so on.

16.3  Games with Numbers
(i) Reversing the digits – two digit number
Minakshi asks Sundaram to think of a 2-digit number, and then to do whatever she asks
him to do, to that number. Their conversation is shown in the following figure. Study the
figure carefully before reading on.
It so happens that Sundaram chose the number 49. So, he got the reversed number
94; then he added these two numbers and got 49 + 94 = 143. Finally he divided this
number by 11 and got 143 ÷ 11 = 13, with no remainder. This is just what Minakshi
had predicted.
PLAYING WITH NUMBERS  251

TRY THESE
Check what the result would have been if Sundaram had chosen the numbers shown
below.
1. 27
2. 39
3. 64
4. 17
Now, let us see if we can explain Minakshi’s “trick”.
Suppose Sundaram chooses the number ab, which is a short form for the 2-digit
number 10a + b. On reversing the digits, he gets the number ba = 10b + a. When he adds
the two numbers he gets:
(10a + b) + (10b + a) = 11a + 11b
= 11 (a + b).
So, the sum is always a multiple of 11, just as Minakshi had claimed.
Observe here that if we divide the sum by 11, the quotient is a + b, which is exactly the
sum of the digits of chosen number ab.
You may check the same by taking any other two digit number.
The game between Minakshi and Sundaram continues!
Minakshi: Think of another 2-digit number, but don’t tell me what it is.
Sundaram: Alright.
Minakshi: Now reverse the digits of the number, and subtract the smaller number from
the larger one.
Sundaram: I have done the subtraction. What next?
Minakshi: Now divide your answer by 9. I claim that there will be no remainder!
Sundaram: Yes, you are right. There is indeed no remainder! But this time I think I know
how you are so sure of this!
In fact, Sundaram had thought of 29. So his calculations were: first he got
the number 92; then he got 92 – 29 = 63; and finally he did (63 ÷ 9) and got 7 as
quotient, with no remainder.
Check what the result would have been if Sundaram had chosen the numbers shown
below.
1. 17
2. 21
3. 96
4. 37
Let us see how Sundaram explains Minakshi’s second “trick”. (Now he feels confident
of doing so!)
Suppose he chooses the 2-digit number ab = 10a + b. After reversing the digits, he
gets the number ba = 10b + a. Now Minakshi tells him to do a subtraction, the
smaller number from the larger one.
• If the tens digit is larger than the ones digit (that is, a > b), he does:
(10a + b) – (10b + a) = 10a + b – 10b – a
= 9a – 9b = 9(a – b).
MATHEMATICS
TRY THESE
• If the ones digit is larger than the tens digit (that is, b > a), he does:
(10b + a) – (10a + b) = 9(b – a).
•  And, of course, if a = b, he gets 0.
In each case, the resulting number is divisible by 9. So, the remainder is 0. Observe
here that if we divide the resulting number (obtained by subtraction), the quotient is
a – b or b – a according as a > b or a < b. You may check the same by taking any
other two digit numbers.
(ii) Reversing the digits – three digit number.
Now it is Sundaram’s turn to play some tricks!
Sundaram: Think of a 3-digit number, but don’t tell me what it is.
Minakshi: Alright.
Sundaram: Now make a new number by putting the digits in reverse order, and subtract
the smaller number from the larger one.
Minakshi: Alright, I have done the subtraction. What next?
Sundaram: Divide your answer by 99. I am sure that there will be no remainder!
In fact, Minakshi chose the 3-digit number 349. So she got:
• Reversed number: 943;
• Difference: 943 – 349 = 594;
• Division: 594 ÷ 99 = 6, with no remainder.
Check what the result would have been if Minakshi had chosen the numbers shown
below. In each case keep a record of the quotient obtained at the end.
1. 132
2. 469
3. 737
4. 901
Let us see how this trick works.
Let the 3-digit number chosen by Minakshi be abc = 100a + 10b + c.
After reversing the order of the digits, she gets the number cba = 100c + 10b + a. On
subtraction:
• If a > c, then the difference between the numbers is
(100a + 10b + c) – (100c + 10b + a) = 100a + 10b + c – 100c – 10b – a
= 99a – 99c = 99(a – c).
• If c > a, then the difference between the numbers is
(100c + 10b + a) – (100a + 10b + c) = 99c – 99a = 99(c – a).
• And, of course, if a = c, the difference is 0.
In each case, the resulting number is divisible by 99. So the remainder is 0. Observe
that quotient is a – c or c – a. You may check the same by taking other 3-digit numbers.
(iii) Forming three-digit numbers with given three-digits.
Now it is Minakshi’s turn once more.
PLAYING WITH NUMBERS  253
TRY THESE
Minakshi: Think of any 3-digit number.
Sundaram: Alright, I have done so.
Minakshi: Now use this number to form two more 3-digit numbers, like this: if the
number you chose is abc, then
• ‘the first number is cab (i.e., with the ones digit shifted to the “left end” of
the number);
• the other number is bca (i.e., with the hundreds digit shifted to the “right
end” of the number).
Now add them up. Divide the resulting number by 37. I claim that there will
be no remainder.
Sundaram: Yes. You are right!
In fact, Sundaram had thought of the 3-digit number 237.  After doing what Minakshi had
asked, he got the numbers 723 and 372. So he did:
2  3  7
7  2  3
3  7  2
1  3  3  2
Then he divided the resulting number 1332 by 37:
1332 ÷ 37 = 36,    with no remainder.
Check what the result would have been if Sundaram had chosen the numbers
shown below.
1. 417
2. 632
3. 117
4. 937
Will this trick always work?
Let us see.
abc = 100a + 10b + c
cab = 100c + 10a + b
bca = 100b + 10c + a
abc + cab + bca = 111(a + b + c)
= 37 × 3(a + b + c), which is divisible by 37
16.4  Letters for Digits
Here we have puzzles in which letters take the place of digits in an arithmetic ‘sum’, and
the problem is to find out which letter represents which digit; so it is like cracking a code.
Here we stick to problems of addition and multiplication.
Form all possible 3-digit numbers using all the digits 2, 3 and
7 and find their sum. Check whether the sum is divisible by
37! Is it true for the sum of all the numbers formed by the
digits a, b and c of the number abc?
MATHEMATICS
Here are two rules we follow while doing such puzzles.
1. Each letter in the puzzle must stand for just one digit. Each digit must be
represented by just one letter.
2. The first digit of a number cannot be zero. Thus, we write the number “sixty
three” as 63, and not as 063, or 0063.
A rule that we would like to follow is that the puzzle must have just one answer.
Example 1: Find Q in the addition.
3  1  Q
+ 1  Q  3
5  0  1
Solution:
There is just one letter Q whose value we have to find.
Study the addition in the ones column: from Q + 3, we get ‘1’, that is, a number whose
ones digit is 1.
For this to happen, the digit Q should be 8. So the puzzle can be solved as shown below.
3  1  8
1  8  3
5  0  1
That is, Q = 8
Example 2: Find A and B in the addition.
Solution:  This has two letters  A and B whose values are to be found.
Study the addition in the ones column: the sum of three A’s is a number whose ones digit
is A. Therefore, the sum of two A’s must be a number whose ones digit is 0.
This happens only for A = 0 and A = 5.
If A = 0, then the sum is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which makes B = 0 too. We do not want this
(as it makes A = B, and then the tens digit of BA too becomes 0), so we reject this
possibility. So, A = 5.
Therefore, the puzzle is solved as shown below.
That is, A = 5 and B = 1.
PLAYING WITH NUMBERS  255
DO THIS
Example 3: Find the digits A and B.
Solution:
This also has two letters  A and B whose values are to be found.
Since the ones digit of 3 × A is A, it must be that A = 0 or A = 5.
Now look at B. If B = 1, then BA × B3 would at most be equal to 19 × 19; that is,
it would at most be equal to 361. But the product here is 57A, which is more than 500. So
we cannot have B = 1.
If B = 3, then BA × B3  would be more than 30 × 30; that is, more than 900. But 57A
is less than 600. So, B can not be equal to 3.
Putting these two facts together, we see that B = 2 only. So the multiplication is either
20 × 23, or 25 × 23.
The first possibility fails, since 20 × 23 = 460. But, the
second one works out correctly, since 25 × 23 = 575.
So the answer is A = 5, B = 2.
Write a 2-digit number ab and the number obtained by reversing its digits i.e., ba. Find
their sum. Let the sum be a  3-digit number dad
i.e.,
ab + ba = dad
(10a + b) + (10b + a) = dad
11(a + b) = dad
The sum a + b can not exceed 18 (Why?).
Is dad a multiple of 11?
Is dad less than 198?
Write all the 3-digit numbers which are multiples of 11 upto 198.
Find the values of a and d.
EXERCISE 16.1

16.5  Tests of Divisibility
In Class VI, you learnt how to check divisibility by the following divisors.
10, 5, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8, 9, 11.
You would have found the tests easy to do, but you may have wondered at the same
time why they work. Now, in this chapter, we shall go into the “why” aspect of the above.
16.5.1 Divisibility by 10
This is certainly the easiest test of all! We first look at some multiples of 10.
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ... ,
and then at some non-multiples of 10.
13, 27, 32, 48, 55, 69,
From these lists we see that if the ones digit of a number is 0, then the number is a
multiple of 10; and if the ones digit is not 0, then the number is not a multiple of 10. So, we
get a test of divisibility by 10.
Of course, we must not stop with just stating the test; we must also explain why it
“works”. That is not hard to do; we only need to remember the rules of place value.
Take the number. ... cba; this is a short form for
... + 100c + 10b + a
Here a is the one’s digit, b is the ten’s digit, c is the hundred’s digit, and so on. The
dots are there to say that there may be more digits to the left of c.
Since 10, 100, ... are divisible by 10, so are 10b, 100c, ... . And as for the number a
is concerned, it must be a divisible by 10 if the given number is divisible by 10. This is
possible only when a = 0.
Hence, a number is divisible by 10 when its one’s digit is 0.
16.5.2  Divisibility by 5
Look at the multiples of 5.
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,
C A B
C A B
PLAYING WITH NUMBERS  257
TRY THESE
TRY THESE
We see that the one’s digits are alternately 5 and 0, and no other digit ever
appears in this list.
So, we get our test of divisibility by 5.
If the ones digit of a number is 0 or 5, then it is divisible by 5.
Let us explain this rule. Any number ... cba can be written as:
... + 100c + 10b + a
Since 10, 100 are divisible by 10 so are 10b, 100c, ... which in turn, are divisible
by 5 because 10 = 2 × 5. As far as number a is concerned it must be divisible by 5 if the
number is divisible by 5. So a has to be either 0 or 5.
(The first one has been done for you.)
1. If the division N ÷ 5 leaves a remainder of 3, what might be the ones digit of N?
(The one’s digit, when divided by 5, must leave a remainder of 3. So the one’s digit
must be either 3 or 8.)
2. If the division N ÷ 5 leaves a remainder of 1, what might be the one’s digit of N?
3. If the division N ÷ 5 leaves a remainder of 4, what might be the one’s digit of N?
16.5.3  Divisibility by 2
Here are the even numbers.
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, ... ,
and here are the odd numbers.
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, ... ,
We see that a natural number is even if its one’s digit is
2, 4, 6, 8 or 0
A number is odd if its one’s digit is
1, 3, 5, 7 or 9
Recall the test of divisibility by 2 learnt in Class VI, which is as follows.
If the one’s digit of a number is 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 then the number is divisible by 2.
The explanation for this is as follows.
Any number cba can be written as 100c + 10b + a
First two terms namely 100c, 10b are divisible by 2 because 100 and 10 are divisible
by 2. So far as a is concerned, it must be divisible by 2 if the given number is divisible by
2. This is possible only when a = 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.
(The first one has been done for you.)
1. If the division N ÷ 2 leaves a remainder of 1, what might be the one’s digit of N?
(N is odd; so its one’s digit is odd. Therefore, the one’s digit must be 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9.)

2. If the division N ÷ 2 leaves no remainder (i.e., zero remainder), what might be the
one’s digit of N?
3. Suppose that the division N ÷ 5 leaves a remainder of 4, and the division N ÷ 2
leaves a remainder of 1. What must be the one’s digit of N?
16.5.4  Divisibility by 9 and 3
Look carefully at the three tests of divisibility found till now, for checking division by
10, 5 and 2. We see something common to them: they use only the one’s digit of the
given number; they do not bother about the ‘rest’ of the digits. Thus, divisibility
is decided just by the one’s digit. 10, 5, 2 are divisors of 10, which is the key
number in our place value.
But for checking divisibility by 9, this will not work. Let us take some number say 3573.
Its expanded form is: 3 × 1000 + 5 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 3
This is equal to 3 × (999 + 1) + 5 × (99 + 1) + 7 × (9 + 1) + 3
= 3 × 999 + 5 × 99 + 7 × 9 + (3 + 5 + 7 + 3)
... (1)
We see that the number 3573 will be divisible by 9 or 3 if (3 + 5 + 7 + 3) is divisible
by 9 or 3.
We see that 3 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 18 is divisible by 9 and also by 3. Therefore, the number
3573 is divisible by both 9 and 3.
Now, let  us consider the number 3576. As above, we get
3576 = 3 × 999 + 5 × 99 + 7 × 9 + (3 + 5 + 7 + 6)
... (2)
Since (3 + 5 + 7 + 6) i.e., 21 is not divisible by 9 but is divisible by 3,
therefore 3576 is not divisible by 9. However 3576 is divisible by 3. Hence,
(i) A number N is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Otherwise it is
not divisible by 9.
(ii) A number N is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Otherwise it is
not divisible by 3.
If the number is ‘cba’, then, 100c + 10b + a = 99c + 9b + (a + b + c)
divisible by 3 and 9
Hence, divisibility by 9 (or 3) is possible if a + b + c is divisible by 9 (or 3).
Example 4: Check the divisibility of 21436587 by 9.
Solution: The sum of the digits of 21436587 is 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 7 = 36.
This number is divisible by 9 (for 36 ÷ 9 = 4). We conclude that 21436587 is divisible by 9.
We can double-check:
21436587
= 2381843
(the division is exact).

Example 6: If the three digit number 24x is divisible by 9, what is the value of x?
Solution: Since 24x is divisible by 9, sum of  it’s digits, i.e., 2 + 4 + x should be
divisible by 9, i.e., 6 + x should be divisible by 9.
This is possible when 6 + x = 9 or 18, ....
But, since x is a digit, therefore, 6 + x = 9, i.e., x = 3.
1. You have seen that a number 450 is divisible by 10. It is also divisible by 2 and 5
which are factors of 10. Similarly, a number 135 is divisible 9. It is also divisible
by 3 which is a factor of 9.
Can you say that if a number is divisible by any number m, then it will also be
divisible by each of the factors of m?
2. (i)   Write a 3-digit number abc as 100a + 10b + c
= 99a + 11b + (a – b + c)
= 11(9a + b) + (a – b + c)
If the number abc is divisible by 11, then what can you say about
(a – b + c)?
Is it necessary that (a + c – b) should be divisible by 11?
(ii) Write a 4-digit number abcd as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d
= (1001a + 99b + 11c) – (a – b + c – d)
= 11(91a + 9b + c) + [(b + d) – (a + c)]
If the number abcd is divisible by 11, then what can you say about
[(b + d) – (a + c)]?
(iii) From (i) and (ii) above, can you say that a number will be divisible by 11 if
the difference between the sum of digits at its odd places and that of digits at
the even places is divisible by 11?
Example 7: Check the divisibility of 2146587 by 3.
Solution: The sum of the digits of 2146587 is 2 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 7 = 33. This
number is divisible by 3 (for 33 ÷ 3 = 11). We conclude that 2146587 is divisible by 3.

EXERCISE 16.2
1. If 21y5 is a multiple of 9, where y is a digit, what is the value of y?
2. If 31z5 is a multiple of 9, where z is a digit, what is the value of z?
You will find that there are two answers for the last problem. Why is this so?
3. If 24x is a multiple of 3, where x is a digit, what is the value of x?
(Since 24x is a multiple of 3, its sum of digits 6 + x is a multiple of 3; so 6 + x is one
of these numbers: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, ... . But since x is a digit, it can only be that
6 + x = 6 or 9 or 12 or 15. Therefore, x = 0 or 3 or 6 or 9. Thus, x can have any of
four different values.)
4. If 31z5 is a multiple of 3, where z is a digit, what might be the values of z?
