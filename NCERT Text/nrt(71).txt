Glossary     157
Agro-climatic
The climatic and land resource conditions
in totality which are crucial for the
development of agriculture and allied
economic conditions of a region.
Aquifer
A saturated geological unit (e.g. sands,
gravels, fractured rock) which can yield
water to wells at a sufficient rate to support
a well.
Artificial Recharge to Groundwater
Artificial Recharge to Groundwater means
the process by which groundwater
reservoir is augmented at a rate exceeding
that under natural condition of
replenishment.
Command Area
The area served by a canal system
through supply of water for irrigation and
other purposes.
Culturable command area
It refers to the culturable land irrigated by a
canal system. It is different from gross
command area. The later includes all the
area served by a canal system including
unculturatble.
Eco-development
The process of development of a region
by means of conservation and regeneration
of degraded ecosystem and ecological
sustainability.
Emigration
Movement of people from one place to
another usually from one country to another
with a purpose of earning, living, residing
and settling.
Extensive irrigation
A strategy of irrigation development where
the emphasis is on providing irrigation
water for a large area. Per unit area use of
water is low in this case.
Flow system or channel
A channel of canal where water flows under
the influence of gravity.
Groundwater
Groundwater means the water which exists
below the ground surface in the zone of
saturation and can be extracted through
wells or any other means or emerges as
springs and base flows in streams and
rivers.
Ground Water Table
The top of the zone in which all pore spaces
or fissures are totally filled with water.
Immigration
Movement of a person as a permanent
resident into another area, usually into a
foreign country.
Intrusive irrigation
A strategy of irrigation development where
per unit application of water is high.
Lift system or channel
A channel of canal where water is forced to
flow against the slope of land by upliftment.
Migration
Movement of the people for the specific
purpose from one place to another in the
country or to a foreign country.
Migration stream
Migration stream refers to a group of
migrants with the common origin and
destination.

GLOSSARY
Net migration or balance of migration
The difference of total numbers of persons
arrived in and left out the place. In other
words, it is sum of in migrants and immigrants
minus sum of out migrants and emigrants.  In
mathematical term it is defined as:
Net migration
(in migrants + immigrants) - (out migrants +
emigrants)
Rain Water Harvesting
Rain Water Harvesting is the technique of
collection and storage of rain water at
surface or in sub-surface aquifer.
Refugee
People who are forced to take shelter in
other country due to life threatening situation,
insecurity, war or violation of human rights
in their own country.
Remittance
All cash or kinds sent by the migrants to
their place of origin. Money order is one
form of remittance.
Transhuemance
The practice of seasonal migration where
the pastoral communities migrate to the
pastures along with their herds during
summer season. These communities return
to their permanent residence in winter.
Warebandi system
It is a system of equitable distribution of
water in the command area of canal outlet.
Watershed
A watershed is a natural geo-hydrological
unit of land, which collects water and drains
it through a common point by a system of
streams. Such a unit can be a small area of
a few hectares or it could be an area of
hundreds of  square kilometres like the
Ganga river basin.

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This
principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which
continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home
and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to
discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between
different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly
further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in
the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by
engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher secondary level,
Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor
M.H. Qureshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members
of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of
Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation
committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of
its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable
us to undertake further revision and refinement.

POPULATION
Distribution, Density, Growth
and Composition
The people are very important component of a
country. India is the second most populous
country after China in the world with its total
population of 1,028 million (2001). India’s
population is larger than the total population
of North America, South America and Australia
put together. More often, it is argued that such
a large population invariably puts pressure
on its limited resources and is also responsible
for many socio-economic problems in the
country.
How do you perceive the idea of India? Is
it simply a territory? Does this signify an
amalgam of people? Is it a territory
inhabited by people living under certain
institutions of governance?
In this chapter, we will discuss the
patterns of distribution, density, growth and
composition of India’s population.

Examine Fig. 1.1 and try to describe the
patterns of spatial distribution of population
shown on it. It is clear that India has a highly
uneven pattern of population distribution. The
percentage shares of population of the states
and Union Territories in the country (Appendix –
iA) show that Uttar Pradesh has the highest
population followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and
West Bengal.
Looking at the data in Appendix (i) and iA arrange the
Indian states and union territories according to their
sizes and population and find out :

2015-16
Population: Distribution, Density, Growth and Composition      3
States/UTs of large size and large population
States/UTs of large size but small population
States/UTs of smaller size but larger population
Check from the table (Appendix–iA) that U.P.,
Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra
Pradesh along with Tamil Nadu, Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat,
together account for about 76 per cent of the
total population of the country. On the other
hand, share of population is very small in the
states like Jammu & Kashmir (1.04%),
Arunachal Pradesh (0.11%) and Uttarakhand
(0.84%) inspite of theses  states having fairly
large geographical area.
Such an uneven spatial distribution of
population in India suggests a close relationship
between population and physical, socio-
economic and historical factors. As far as the
physical factors are concerned, it is clear that
climate along with terrain and availability of
water largely determines the pattern of the
population distribution. Consequently, we
observe that the North Indian Plains, deltas and
Coastal Plains have higher proportion of
population than the interior districts of southern
and central Indian States, Himalayas, some of
the north eastern and the western states.
However, development of irrigation (Rajasthan),
availability of mineral and energy resources
(Jharkhand) and development of transport
network (Peninsular States) have resulted in
moderate to high concentration of population
in areas which were previously very thinly
populated.
Among the socio-economic and historical
factors of distribution of population, important
ones are evolution of settled agriculture and
agricultural development; pattern of human
settlement; development of transport network,
industrialisation and urbanisation. It is
observed that the regions falling in the river
plains and coastal areas of India have remained
the regions of larger  population concentration.
Even though the uses of natural resources like
land and water in these regions have shown
the sign of degradation, the concentration of
population remains high because of an early
history of human settlement and development
of transport network. On the other hand, the
urban regions of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata,
Bangalore, Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai and
Jaipur have high concentration of population
due to industrial development and
urbanisation drawing a large numbers of
rural-urban migrants.

Density of population, is expressed as number
of persons per unit area. It helps in getting a
better understanding of the spatial distribution
of population in relation to land. The density of
population in India (2011) is 382 persons per
sq km. There has been a steady increase of more
than 200 persons per sq km over the last 50
years as the density of population increased
from 117 persons/ sq km in 1951 to 382
persons/sq km in 2011.
The data shown in Appendix (i)A give an
idea of spatial variation of population densities
in the country which ranges from as low as 17
persons per sq km in Arunachal Pradesh to
11,320 persons in the National Capital Territory
of Delhi. Among the northern Indian States,
Bihar (1106), West Bengal (1028) and and Uttar
Pradesh (829) have higher densities, while
Kerala (860) and Tamil Nadu (555) have higher
densities among the peninsular Indian states.
States like Assam, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh,
Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha have moderate
densities. The hill states of the Himalayan region
and North eastern states of India (excluding
Assam) have relatively low densities while the
Union Territories (excluding Andaman and
Nicobar islands) have very high densities of
population (Appendix–iA).
The density of population, as discussed
in the earlier paragraph, is a crude measure
of human and land relationship. To get a better
insight into the human-land ratio in terms of
pressure of population on total cultivable land,
the physiological and the agricultural densities
should be found out which are significant for
a country like India having a large agricultural
population.

Agricultural population includes cultivators
and agricultural labourers and their family
members.
With the help of data given in Appendix (ii), Calculate
the Physiological and Agricultural densities of
population of Indian States and Union Territories.
Compare them with density of population and see how
are these different?

Growth of population is the change in the
number of people living in a particular area
between two points of time. Its rate is expressed
in percentage. Population growth has two
components namely; natural and induced.
While the natural growth is analysed by
assessing the crude birth and death rates, the
induced components are explained by the
volume of inward and outward movement of
people in any given area. However, in the
present chapter, we will only discuss the
natural growth of India’s population.
The decadal and annual growth rates of
population in India are both very high and
steadily increasing over time. The annual
growth rate of India’s population is 1.64 per
cent (2011).

Population doubling time is the time taken
by any population to double  itself at its
current annual growth rate.
The growth rate of population in India over
the last one century has been caused by annual
birth rate and death rate and rate of migration
and thereby shows different trends. There are
four distinct phases of growth identified within
this period:
* Decadal growth rate:
where
P1 = population of the base year
P2 = population of the present year

Population: Distribution, Density, Growth and Composition      7
Phase I :
The period from 1901-1921 is
referred to as a period of stagnant
or stationary phase of growth of
India’s population, since in this
period growth rate was very low,
even recording a negative growth
rate during 1911-1921. Both the
birth rate and death rate were high
keeping the rate of increase low
(Appendix–iii). Poor health and
medical services, illiteracy of people
at large and inefficient distribution
system of food and other basic
necessities were largely responsible
for a high birth and death rates in
this period.
Phase II :
The decades 1921-1951 are
referred to as the period of steady
population growth. An overall
improvement in health and
sanitation throughout the country
brought down the mortality rate. At
the same time better transport and
communication system improved
distribution system. The crude
birth rate remained high in this
period leading to higher growth rate
than the previous phase. This is
impressive at the backdrop of Great
Economic Depression, 1920s and
World War II.
Phase III : The decades 1951-1981 are
referred to as the period of
population explosion in India,
which was caused by a rapid fall
in the mortality rate but a high
fertility rate of population in the
country. The average annual
growth rate was as high as 2.2 per
cent. It is in this period, after the
Independence, that developmental
activities were introduced through
a centralised planning process and
economy started showing up
ensuring the improvement of living
condition of people at large.
Consequently, there was a high
natural increase and higher growth
rate.
Besides,
increased
international migration bringing in
Tibetans, Bangladeshis, Nepalies
and even people from Pakistan
contributed to the high growth rate.
Phase IV : In the post 1981 till present, the
growth rate of country’s population
though remained high, has started
slowing down gradually (Table 1.1).
A downward trend of crude birth
rate is held responsible for such a
population growth. This was, in
turn, affected by an increase in the
mean age at marriage, improved
quality of life particularly education
of females in the country.
The growth rate of population is, however,
still high in the country, and it has been
projected by World Development Report that
population of India will touch 1,350 million by
2025.
The analysis done so far shows the average
growth rate, but the country also has wide
variation (Appendix–iv) in growth rates from one
area to another which is discussed below.

The growth rate of population during 1991-
2001 in Indian States and Union Territories
shows very obvious pattern.
The States like Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Puducherry,
and Goa show a low rate of growth not exceeding
20 per cent over the decade. Kerala registered
the lowest growth rate (9.4) not only in this group
of states but also in the country as a whole.
A continuous belt of states from west to
east in the north-west, north, and north central
parts of the country has relatively high growth
rate than the southern states. It  is in this belt
comprising Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,
Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, West Bengal,
Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand, the growth
rate on the average remained 20-25 per cent.
During 2001-2011, the growth rates of
almost all States and Union Territories have
registered a lower figure compared to the
previous decade, namely, 1991-2001. The
percentage decadal growth rates of the six most
populous States, namely, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra
2015-16
India : People and Economy
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have all fallen
during 2001-2011 compared to 1991-2001,
the fall being the lowest for Andhra Pradesh
(3.5% percentage points) and highest for
Maharashtra (6.7 percentage points). Tamil
Nadu (3.9 percentage points) and Puducherry
(7.1 percentage points) have registered some
increase during 2001-2011 over the previous
decade.
With the help of data given in Appendix i and iA, compare
the growth rate of population of different States/UTs
between 1990-2001 and 2001-2011.
Take the population growth data of the districts/selected
districts of your respective state for total male and female
population and represent them  with the help of
Composite Bar Graph.
An important aspect of population growth
in India is the growth of its adolescents. At
present the share of adolescents i.e., up to the
age group of 10-19 years is about 20.9 per cent
(2011), among which male adolescents
constitute 52.7 per cent and female adolescents
constitute 47.3 per cent. The adolescent
population, though, regarded as the youthful
population having high potentials, but at the
same time they are quite vulnerable if not guided
and  channelised properly. There are many
challenges for the society as far as these
adolescents are concerned, some of which are
lower age at marriage, illiteracy – particularly
female illiteracy, school dropouts, low intake of
nutrients, high rate of maternal mortality of
adolescent mothers, high rates of HIV/AIDS
infections, physical and mental disability or
retardedness, drug abuse and alcoholism, juvenile
delinquency and commitence of crimes, etc.
In view of these, the Government of India
has undertaken certain policies to impart
proper education to the adolescent groups so
that their talents are better channelised and
properly utilised. The National Youth Policy is
one example which has been designed to look
into the overall development of our large youth
and adolescent population.
The National Youth Policy of Government
of India, launched in 2003, stresses on an all-
round improvement of the youth and
adolescents enabling them to shoulder
responsibility
towards
constructive
development of the country. It also aims at
reinforcing the qualities of patriotism and
responsible citizenship.
The thrust of this policy is youth
empowerment in terms of their effective
participation in decision making and carrying
the responsibility of an able leader. Special
emphasis was given in empowering women and
girl child to bring parity in  the male-female
status. Moreover, deliberate efforts were made
to look into youth health, sports and recreation,
creativity and awareness about new innovations
in the spheres of science and technology.
It appears from the above discussion that
the growth rate of population is widely variant
over space and time in the country and also
highlights various social problems related to the
growth of population. However, in order to have
a better insight into the growth pattern of
population it is also necessary to look into the
social composition of population.

Population composition is a distinct field of
study within population geography with a vast
coverage of analysis of age and sex, place of
residence, ethnic characteristics, tribes,
language, religion, marital status, literacy and
education, occupational characteristics, etc. In
this section, the composition of Indian
population with respect to their rural-urban
characteristics, language, religion and pattern
of occupation will be discussed.
Rural – Urban Composition
Composition of population by their respective
places of residence is an important indicator of
social and economic characteristics. This becomes
even more significant for a country where about
68.8 per cent of its total population lives in village
(2011).
2015-16
Population: Distribution, Density, Growth and Composition      9
Compare the data given in Appendix (iv) and iv A
calculate the percentages of rural population of the
states in India and represent them cartographically on
a map of India.
Do you know that India has 640,867
villages according to the Census 2011 out of
which 597,608 (93.2 per cent) are inhabited
villages? However, the distribution of rural
population is not uniform throughout the
country. You might have noted that the states
like Bihar and Sikkim have very high
percentage of rural population. The states of
Goa and Maharashtra have only little over half
of their total population residing in villages.
The Union Territories, on the other hand,
have smaller proportion of rural population,
except Dadra and Nagar Haveli (53.38 per cent).
The size of villages also varies considerably. It
is less than 200 persons in the  hill states of
north-eastern India, Western Rajasthan and
Rann of Kuchchh and as high as 17 thousand
persons in the states of Kerala and in parts of
Maharashtra. A thorough examination of the
pattern of distribution of rural population of
India reveals that both at intra-State and inter-
State levels, the relative degree of urbanisation
and extent of rural-urban migration regulate
the concentration of rural population.
You have noted that contrary to rural
population, the proportion of urban population
(31.16 per cent) in India is quite low but it is
showing a much faster rate of growth over the
decades. The growth rate of urban population
has accelerated due to enhanced economic
development and improvement in health and
hygienic conditions.
The distribution of urban population too,
as in the case of total population, has a wide
variation throughout the country (Appendix–iv).
Compare the data of Appendix (iv) and iv A and identify
the states/UTs with very high and very low proportion of
urban population.
It is, however, noticed that in almost all
the states and Union Territories, there has been
a considerable increase of urban population.
This indicates both development of urban areas
in terms of socio-economic conditions and an
increased rate of rural-urban migration. The
rural-urban migration is conspicuous in the
case of urban areas along the main road links
and railroads in the North Indian Plains, the
industrial areas around Kolkata, Mumbai,
Bengaluru – Mysuru, Madurai – Coimbatore,
Ahmedabad – Surat, Delhi – Kanpur and
Ludhiana – Jalandhar. In the agriculturally
stagnant parts of the middle and lower Ganga
Plains, Telengana, non-irrigated Western
Rajasthan, remote hilly, tribal areas of north-
east, along the flood prone areas of Peninsular
India and along eastern part of Madhya
Pradesh, the degree of urbanisation has
remained low.
Linguistic Composition
India is a land of linguistic diversity. According
to Grierson (Linguistic Survey of India, 1903 –
1928) there were 179 languages and as many
as 544 dialects in the country. In the context of
modern India, there are about 22 scheduled
languages and a number of non-scheduled
languages. See how many languages appear
on a ten Rs note. Among the scheduled
languages, the speakers of Hindi have the
highest percentage. The smallest language
groups are Kashmiri and Sanskrit speakers.
However, it is noticed that the linguistic regions
in the country do not maintain a sharp and
distinct boundary, rather they gradually merge
and overlap in their respective border zones.
Linguistic Classification
The speakers of major Indian languages
belong to four language families, which have
their sub-families and branches or groups.
This can be better understood from Table 1.2.
Religious Composition
Religion is one of the most dominant forces
affecting the cultural and political life of the most
of Indians. Since religion virtually permeates
into almost all the aspects of people’s family and
community lives, it is important to study the
religious composition in detail.

The spatial distribution of religious
communities in the country (Appendix–v) shows
that there are certain states and districts having
large numerical strength of one religion, while
the same may be very negligibly represented in
other states.
Hindus are distributed as a major group in
many states (ranging from 70 - 90 per cent and
above) except the districts of states along Indo-
Bangladesh border, Indo-Pak border, Jammu &
Kashmir, Hill States of North-East and in scattered
areas of Deccan Plateau and Ganga Plain.

The Christian population is distributed
mostly in rural areas of the country. The main
concentration is observed along the Western
coast around Goa, Kerala and also in the hill
states of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland,
Chotanagpur area and Hills of Manipur.
Sikhs are mostly concentrated in relatively
small area of the country, particularly in the
states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi.
Jains and Buddhists, the smallest religious
groups in India have their concentration only
in selected areas of the country. Jains have
major concentration in the urban areas of
Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra, while the
Buddhists are concentrated mostly in
Maharashtra. The other areas of Buddhist
majority are Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh,
Ladakh in Jammu & Kashmir, Tripura, and
Lahul and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
The other religions of India include
Zoroastrians, tribal and other indigenous faiths
and beliefs. These groups are concentrated in
small pockets scattered throughout the country.
Composition of Working Population
The population of India according to their
economic status is divided into three groups,
namely; main workers, marginal workers and
non-workers.
It is observed that in India, the proportion
of workers (both main and marginal) is only 39.8
per cent (2011) leaving a vast majority of about
60 per cent as non-workers. This indicates an
economic status in which there is a larger
proportion of dependent population, further
indicating possible existence of large number of
unemployed or under employed people.
What is work participation rate?
The proportion of working population, of
the states and Union Territories show a
moderate variation from about 39.6 per cent in
Goa to about 49.9 per cent in Daman and Diu.
The states with larger percentages of workers
are Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Chhattisgarh,
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Arunachal
Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Meghalaya.
Among the Union Territories, Dadra and Nagar
Haveli and Daman and Diu have higher
participation rate. It is understood that, in the
context of a country like India, the work
participation rate tends to be higher in the areas
of lower levels of economic development since
number of manual workers are needed to
perform the subsistence or near subsistence
economic activities.
The occupational composition  (see box)
of India’s population (which actually means
engagement of an individual in farming,
manufacturing trade, services or any kind of
professional activities) shows a large proportion
of primary sector workers compared to
secondary and tertiary sectors. About 54.6 per
cent of total working population are cultivators
and agricultural labourers, whereas only 3.8%
of workers are engaged in household industries
and 41.6 % are other workers including non-
household industries, trade, commerce,
construction and repair and other services. As
far as the occupation of country’s male and
female population is concerned, male workers
out-number female workers in all the three
sectors (Fig.1.4 and Table 1.4).

Formal expression of religions on
landscape is manifested through sacred
structures, use of cemetries and
assemblages of plants and animals, groves
of trees for religious purposes. Sacred
structures are widely distributed throughout
the country. These may range from
inconspicuous village shrines to large Hindu
temples, monumental masjids or ornately
designed cathedrals in large metropolitan
cities. These temples, masjids, gurudwaras,
monastries and churches differ in size,
form, space – use and density, while
attributing a special dimension to the total
landscape of the area.

Occupational Categories
The 2001 Census has divided the working
population of India into four major categories:
1. Cultivators
2. Agricultural Labourers
3. Household Industrial Workers
4. Other Workers.
The number of female workers is relatively
high in primary sector, though in recent years
there has been some improvement in work
participation of women in secondary and
tertiary sectors.
It is important to note that the proportion
of workers in agricultural sector in India has
shown a decline over the last few decades (58.2%
in 2001 to 54.6% in 2011). Consequently, the
participation rate in secondary and tertiary sector
has registered an increase. This indicates a shift
of dependence of workers from farm-
based occupations to non-farm
based ones, indicating a sectoral shift
in the economy of the country.
The spatial variation of work
participation rate in different sectors
in the country (Appendix–v and vA)
is very wide. For instance, the states
like Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland
have very large shares of cultivators.
On the other hand states like Bihar,
Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal
and Madhya Pradesh have higher proportion of
agricultural labourers. The highly urbanised
areas like Delhi, Chandigarh and Puducherry
have a very large proportion of workers being
engaged in other services. This indicates not only
availability of limited farming land, but also large
scale urbanisation and industrialisation
requiring more workers in non-farm sectors.

MIGRATION
Types, Causes and
Consequences
Ram Babu, working as an engineer in Bhilai
Steel Plant, Chhattisgarh, was born in a small
village of district Bhojpur, Bihar.  At an early
age of twelve he moved to a nearby town Ara to
complete his intermediate level studies. He went
to Sindri, Jharkhand for his engineering degree
and he got a job at Bhilai, where he is living for
the last 31 years. His parents were illiterate and
the only source of their livelihood was meagre
income from agriculture. They spent their whole
life in that village.
Ram Babu has three children who got their
education up to the intermediate level at Bhilai
and then moved to different places for higher
education. First one studied at Allahabad and
Mumbai and is presently working in Delhi as a
scientist. The second child got her higher
education from different universities in India
and is now working in USA. The third one after
finishing her education settled at Surat after
marriage.
This is not a story of only Ram Babu and
his children but such movements are
increasingly becoming universal trend. People
have been moving from one village to another,
from villages to towns, from smaller towns to
bigger towns and from one country to another.
In your Book Fundamentals of Human
Geography you have already learnt about the
concept and definition of migration. Migration
has been an integral part and a very important
factor in redistributing population over time
and space. India has witnessed the waves of
migrants coming to the country from Central
and West Asia and also from Southeast Asia.
In fact, the history of India is a history of waves
of migrants coming and settling one after
another in different parts of the country. In the
words of a renowned poet Firaque Gorakhpuri;
SAR ZAMIN-E-HIND PAR AQWAM-E-ALAM KE
FIRAQUE
CARVAN BASTE GAYE, HINDOSTAN BANTA
(The carvans of people from all parts of the
world kept on coming and settling in India and
led to the formation of India.)
Similarly, large numbers of people from
India too have been migrating to places in search

of better opportunities specially to the countries
of the Middle-East, Western Europe, America,
Australia and East and South East Asia.
Indian Diaspora
During colonial period (British period)
millions of the indentured labourers were
sent to Mauritius, Caribbean islands
(Trinidad, Tobago and Guyana), Fiji and
South Africa by British from Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar; to Reunion Island, Guadeloupe,
Martinique and Surinam by French and
Dutch and by Portuguese from Goa, Daman
and Diu to Angola, Mozambique to work as
plantation workers. All such migrations were
covered under the time-bound contract
known as Girmit Act (Indian Emigration Act).
However, the living conditions of these
indentured labourers were not better than
the slaves.
The second wave of migrants ventured out into
the neighbouring countries in recent times as
professionals, artisans, traders and factory
workers, in search of economic opportunities
to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
Brunei and African countries, etc. and the
trend still continues. There was a steady
outflow of India’s semi-skilled and skilled labour
in the wake of the oil boom in West Asia in
the 1970s. There was also some outflow of
entrepreneurs, storeowners, professionals,
businessmen to Western Countries.
Third wave, of migrant was comprised
professionals like doctors, engineers (1960s
onwards), software engineers, management
consultants, financial experts, media
persons (1980s onwards), and others
migrated to countries such as USA, Canada,
UK, Australia, New Zealand and Germany,
etc. These professional enjoy the distinction
of being one of highly educated, the highest
earning and prospering groups. After
liberalisation, in the 90s education and
knowledge–based Indian emigration has
made Indian Diaspora one of the most
powerful diasporas in the world.
In all these countries, Indian diaspora has
been playing an important role in the
development of the respective countries.

You are familiar with Census in India. It contains
information about migration in the country.
Actually migration was recorded beginning
from the first Census of India conducted in
1881. This data were recorded on the basis of
place of birth. However, the first major
modification was introduced in 1961 Census
by bringing in two additional components viz;
place of birth i.e. village or town and duration
of residence (if born elsewhere). Further in
1971, additional information on place of last
residence and duration of stay at the place of
enumeration were incorporated. Information on
reasons for migration were incorporated in
1981 Census and modified in consecutive
Censuses.
In the Census the following questions are
asked on migration :
Is the person born in this village or
town? If no, then further information
is taken on rural/urban status of the
place of birth, name of district and state
and if outside India then name of the
country of birth.
Has the person come to this village or
town from elsewhere? If yes, then
further questions are asked about the
status (rural/urban) of previous place
of residence, name of district and state
and if outside India then name of the
country.
In addition, reasons for migration from the
place of last residence and duration of residence
in place of enumeration are also asked.
In the Census of India migration is
enumerated on two bases : (i) place of birth, if
the place of birth is different from the place of
enumeration (known as life-time migrant);
(ii) place of residence, if the place of last
residence is different from the place of
enumeration (known as migrant by place of last
residence). Can you imagine the proportion of
migrants in the population of India? As per
2001 census, out of 1,029 million people in the
country, 307 million (30 per cent) were reported
as migrants by place of birth. However, this
figure was 315 million (31 per cent) in case of
place of last residence.

Streams of Migration
A few facts pertaining to the internal
migration (within the country) and
international migration (out of the country
and into the country from other countries)
are presented here. Under the internal
The distribution of male and female
migrants in different streams of intra-state and
inter-state migration is presented in
Fig. 2.1 a and 2.1 b. It is clearly evident that
females predominate the streams of short
distance rural to rural migration in both types
of migration. Contrary to this, men predominate
the rural to urban stream of inter-state
migration due to economic reasons.
Apart from these streams of internal
migration, India also experiences immigration
from and emigration to the neighbouring
countries. Table 2.1 presents the details of
migrants from neighbouring countries. Indian
migration, four streams are identified: (a)

315 million migrants, enumerated on the
basis of the last residence, 98 million had
changed their place of residence in the last
ten years. Out of these, 81 million were intra-
state migrants. The stream was dominated
by female migrants. Most of these were
migrants related to marriage.
Census 2001 has recorded that more than 5
million person have migrated to India from
other countries. Out of these, 96 per cent came
from the neighbouring countries: Bangladesh
(3.0 million) followed by Pakistan (0.9 million)
and Nepal (0.5 million). Included in this are 0.16
million refugees from T ibet, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and
Myanmar. As far as emigration from India is
concerned it is estimated that there are around
20 million people of Indian Diaspora, spread
across 110 countries.

Spatial Variation in Migration
Some states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and
Haryana attract migrants from other states such
as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, etc. (see Appendix–vii for
detail). Maharashtra occupied first place in the
list with 2.3 million net in-migrants, followed by
Delhi, Gujarat and Haryana. On the other hand,
Uttar Pradesh (-2.6 million) and Bihar
(-1.7 million) were the states, which had the largest
number of net out-migrants from the state.
Among the  urban agglomeration (UA),
Greater Mumbai received the higher number of
in migrants. Intra-states migration constituted
the largest share in it. These differences are
largely due to the size of the state in which these
Urban Agglomeration are located.

Statewise in-migration and out-migration data are given

Causes of Migration
People, generally are emotionally attached to
their place of birth. But millions of people leave
their places of birth and residence. There could
be variety of reasons. These reasons can be put
into two broad categories : (i) push factor, these
cause people to leave their place of residence or
origin; and (ii) pull factors, which attract the
people from different places.
In India people migrate from rural to urban
areas mainly due to poverty, high population
pressure on the land, lack of basic infrastructural
facilities like health care, education, etc. Apart
from these factors, natural disasters such as,
flood, drought, cyclonic storms, earthquake,
The four stories describe different situations of migrants.

tsunami, wars and local conflicts also give extra
push to migrate. On the other hand, there are
pull factors which attract people from rural areas
to cities. The most important pull factor for
majority of the rural migrants to urban areas is
the better opportunities, availability of regular
work and relatively higher wages. Better
opportunities for education, better health
facilities and sources of entertainment, etc. are
also quite important pull factors.
Examine the reasons for migration for
males and females separately in Fig. 2.2. On
the basis of the figures, it can be seen that
reason for migration of males and females are
different. For example, work and employment
have remained the main cause for male
migration (38 per cent) while it is only three per
cent for the females. Contrary to this, about 65
per cent of females move out from their parental
houses following their marriage. This is the
most important cause in the rural areas of India
except in Meghalaya where reverse is the case.
Why is the female marriage migration law
in Meghalaya different?
In comparison to these marriage migration
of the male, is only 2 per cent in the country.
Consequences of Migration
Migration is a response to the uneven
distribution of opportunities over space. People
tend to move from place of low opportunity and
low safety to the place of higher opportunity
and better safety. This, in turn, creates both
benefits and problems for the areas, people
migrate from and migrate to. Consequences can
be observed in economic, social, cultural,
political and demographic terms.
Economic Consequences
A major benefit for the source region is the
remittance sent by migrants. Remittances from
the international migrants are one of the major
sources of foreign exchange. In 2002, India
received US$ 11 billion as remittances from
international migrants. Punjab, Kerala and
Tamil Nadu receive very significant amount
from their international migrants. The amount
of remittances sent by the internal migrants is
very meagre as compared to international
migrants, but it plays an important role in the
growth of economy of the source area.
Remittances are mainly used for food,
repayment of debts, treatment, marriages,
children’s education, agricultural inputs,
construction of houses, etc. For thousands of
the poor villages of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa,
Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, etc.
remittance works as life blood for their economy.
Migration from rural areas of Eastern Uttar
Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa
to the rural areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western
Uttar Pradesh accounted for the success of their
green revolution strategy for agricultural
development. Besides this, unregulated
migration to the metropolitan cities of India has
caused overcrowding. Development of slums in
industrially developed states such as
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu
and Delhi is a negative consequence of
unregulated migration within the country.
Can you name some other positive and
negative consequences of migration?
Demographic Consequences
Migration leads to the redistribution of the
population within a country. Rural urban
migration is one of the important factors
contributing to the population growth of cities.
Age and skill selective out migration from the
rural area have adverse effect on the rural
demographic structure. However, high out
migration from Uttaranchal, Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh and Eastern Maharashtra
have brought serious imbalances in age and
sex composition in these states. Similar
imbalances are also brought in the recipients
states. What is the cause of imbalance in sex
ratio in the place of origin and destination of
the migrants?
Social Consequences
Migrants act as agents of social change. The
new ideas related to new technologies, family

planning, girl’s education, etc. get diffused from
urban to rural areas through them.
Migration leads to intermixing of people
from diverse cultures. It has positive
contribution such as evolution of composite
culture and breaking through the narrow
considerations and widens up the mental
horizon of the people at large. But it also has
serious negative consequences such as
anonimity, which creates social vacuum and
sense of dejection among individuals.
Continued feeling of dejection may motivate
people to fall in the trap of anti-social activities
like crime and drug abuse.
Environmental Consequences
Overcrowding of people due to rural-urban
migration has put pressure on the existing
social and physical infrastructure in the urban
areas. This ultimately leads to unplanned
growth of urban settlement and formation of
slums shanty colonies.
Apart from this, due to over-exploitation
of natural resources, cities are facing the acute
problem of depletion of ground water, air
pollution, disposal of sewage and management
of solid wastes.
Others
Migration (even excluding the marriage
migration) affects the status of women directly
or indirectly. In the rural areas, male selective
out migration leaving their wives behind puts
extra physical as well mental pressure on the
women. Migration of ‘women’ either for
education or employment enhances their
autonomy and role in the economy but also
increases their vulnerability.
If remittances are the major benefits of
migration from the point of view of the source
region, the loss of human resources
particularly highly skilled people is the most
serious cost. The market for advanced skills
has become truly a global market and the
most dynamic industrial economies are
admitting and recruiting significant
proportions of the highly trained professionals
from poor regions. Consequently, the existing
underdevelopment in the source region gets
reinforced.

H U M A N
DEVELOPMENT
Sixty years ago, Rekha was born in a family of
small farmer in Uttarakhand. She helped her
mother in household chores. While her brothers
went to school, she did not receive any
education. She was dependent on her in laws
after she was widowed immediately after
marriage. She could not be economically
independent and faced neglect. Her brother
helped her to migrate to Delhi.
For the first time, she travelled by bus and
train and was exposed to a large city like Delhi.
After a while, the same city which attracted her
with its buildings, roads, avenues and facilities
and amenities disillusioned her.
With greater familiarity of the city, she
could comprehend the paradoxes. The jhuggi
and slum clusters, traffic jams, congestion,
crimes, poverty, small children begging on
traffic lights, people sleeping on footpaths,
polluted water and air revealed another face of
development. She used to think whether
development and under-development coexist?
Whether development help some segments of
population more than the other? Does
development create haves and have nots? Let
us examine these paradoxes and try to
understand the phenomena.
Of all the paradoxes of our times
mentioned in the story, development is the most
significant one. Development of a few regions,
individuals brought about in a short span of
time leads to poverty and malnutrition for many
along with large scale ecological degradation.
Is development class biased?
Apparently,
believed
“Development is freedom” which is often
associated with modernisation, leisure, comfort
and affluence. In the present context,
computerisation, industrialisation, efficient
transport and communication network, large
education system, advanced and modern
medical facilities, safety and security of
individuals, etc. are considered as the symbols
of development. Every individual, community
and government measures its performance or
levels of development in relation to the
availability and access to some of these things.
But, this may be partial and one-sided view of
development. It is often called the western or
euro-centric view of development. For a

existence of our society. Consequently, the poor
are being subjected to three inter-related
processes of declining capabilities; i.e. (1) social
capabilities – due to displacement and
weakening social ties (social capital),
(2) environmental capabilities – due to pollution
and, (3) personal capabilities – due to
increasing incidence of diseases and accidents.
This, in turn, has adverse effects on their quality
of life and human development.
Based on the above experiences, it can be
said that the present development has not been
able to address the issues of social injustice,
regional imbalances and environmental
degradation. On the contrary, it is being widely
considered as the prime cause of the social
distributive injustices, deterioration in the
quality of life and human development,
ecological crisis and social unrest. Does
development create, reinforce and perpetuate
these crises? Thus, it was thought to take up
human development as a separate issue against
the prevalent western views of development
which considers development as the remedy to
all the ills including human development,
regional disparities and environmental crisis.
Concerted efforts were made to look at
development critically at various times in the
past. But, most systematic effort towards this
was the publication of the First Human
Development Report by United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990.
Since then, this organisation has been bringing
out World Human Development Report every
year. This report does not only define human
development, make amendments and changes
its indicators but also ranks all the countries
postcolonial country like India, colonisation,
marginalisation, social discrimination and
regional disparity, etc. show the other face of
development.
Thus, for India, development is a mixed
bag of opportunities as well as neglect and
deprivations. There are a few areas like the
metropolitan centres and other developed
enclaves that have all the modern facilities
available to a small section of its population. At
the other extreme of it, there are large rural
areas and the slums in the urban areas that do
not have basic amenities like potable water,
education and health infrastructure available
to majority of this population. The situation is
more alarming if one looks at the distribution
of the development opportunities among
different sections of our society. It is a well-
established fact that majority of the scheduled
castes, scheduled tribes, landless agricultural
labourers, poor farmers and slums dwellers, etc.
are the most marginalised lot. A large segment
of female population is the worst sufferers
among all.  It is also equally true that the relative
as well as absolute conditions of the majority
of these marginalised sections have worsened
with the development happening over the years.
Consequently, vast majority of people are
compelled to live under abject poverty and sub-
human conditions.
There is yet another inter-related aspect
of development that has direct bearings on the
deteriorating human conditions. It pertains to
the environmental pollution leading to
ecological crisis. Air, soil, water and noise
pollutions have not only led to the ‘tragedy of
commons’ but these have also threatened the
What is Human Development?
“Human development is a process of enlarging the range of people’s choices, increasing their
opportunities for education, health care, income and empowerment and covering the full range of
human choices from a sound physical environment to economic, social  and political freedom.”
Thus, enlarging the range of people’s choices is the most significant aspect of human development.
People’s choices may involve a host of other issues, but, living a long and healthy life, to be educated
and have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living including political freedom,
guaranteed human rights and personal self-respect, etc. are considered some of the non-negotiable
aspects of the human development.

of the world based on the calculated scores.
According to the Human Development Report
1993, “progressive democratisation and
increasing empowerment of people are seen as
the minimum conditions for human
development”. Moreover, it also mentions that
“development must be woven around people,
not the people around development” as was the
case previously.
You have already studied the concepts,
indicators and approaches to human
development and methods of calculating the
index in your book, “Fundamentals of Human
Geography.” In this chapter, let us try to
understand the applicability of these concepts
and indicators to India.
Human Development in India
Human Development in India
Human Development in India
Human Development in India
Human Development in India
India with a population of over 1.09 billion is
ranked 127 among 172 countries of the world
in terms of the Human Development Index
(HDI). With the composite HDI value of O.602
India finds herself grouped with countries
showing medium human development
(UNDP 2005).
Low scores in the HDI is a matter of serious
concern but, some reservations have been
expressed about the approach as well as
indicators selected to calculate the index values
and ranking of the states/countries. Lack of
sensitivity to the historical factors like
colonisation, imperialism and neo-imperialism,
socio-cultural factors like human rights
violation, social discrimination on the basis of
race, religion, gender and caste, social problems
like crimes, terrorism, and war and political
factors like nature of the state, forms of the
government (democracy or dictatorship) level
of empowerment are some factors that are very
crucial in determining the nature of human
development. These aspects have special
significance in case of India and many other
developing countries.
Using the indicators selected by the UNDP,
the Planning Commission of India also
prepared the Human Development Report for
India. It used states and the Union Territories
as the units of analysis. Subsequently, each
state government also started preparing the
state level Human Development Reports, using
districts as the units of analysis. Although, the
final HDI by the Planning Commission of India
has been calculated by taking the three
indicators as discussed in the book entitled,
“Fundamentals of Human Geography”, yet,
this report also discussed other indicators like
economic attainment, social empowerment,
social distributive justice, accessibility, hygiene
and various welfare measures undertaken by
the state. Some of the important indicators have
been discussed in the following pages.
Indicators of Economic Attainments
Rich resource base and access to these
resources by all, particularly the poor, down
trodden and the marginalised is the key to
productivity, well-being and human
development. Gross National Product (GNP)
and its per capita availability are taken as
measures to assess the resource base/
endowment of any country. For India, it is
estimated that its GDP was Rs. 3200 thousand
crores (at current Price) and accordingly, per
capita income was Rs. 20,813 at current prices.
Apparently, these figures indicate an impressive

performance but, prevalence of poverty,
deprivation, malnutrition, illiteracy, various
types of prejudices and above all social
distributive injustices and large-scale regional
disparities belie all the so-called economic
achievements.
There are a few developed States like
Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and
Delhi that have per capita income more than
Rs. 4,000 (figure at 1980-81 prices) per year
and there are a large number of poorer States
like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya
Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, etc.
which have recorded per capita income less
than Rs. 2,000. Corresponding to these
disparities, the developed states have higher per
capita consumption expenditure as compared
to the poorer states. It was estimated to be more
than Rs. 690 per capita per month in States
like Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra and
Gujarat and below Rs. 520 per capita per
month in States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, etc. These
variations are indicative of some other deep-
seated economic problems like poverty,
unemployment and under-employment.
The disaggregated data of poverty for
the states show that there are States like
Orissa and Bihar which have recorded more
than 40 per cent of their population living
below the poverty line. The States of Madhya
Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal
Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland have more
than 30 per cent of their population below
poverty line. “Poverty is a state of
deprivation. In absolute terms it reflects the
inability of an individual to satisfy certain
basic needs for a sustained, healthy and
reasonably productive living.” Employment
rate for educated youth is 25 per cent. Jobless

of the important reasons for higher incidences
of poverty in India.
Indicators of a Healthy Life
Indicators of a Healthy Life
Indicators of a Healthy Life
Indicators of a Healthy Life
Indicators of a Healthy Life
Life free from illness and ailment and living a
reasonably long life span are indicative of a
healthy life. Availability of pre and post natal
health care facilities in order to reduce infant
mortality and post delivery deaths among
mothers, old age health care, adequate nutrition
and safety of individual are some important
measures of a healthy and reasonably long life.
India has done reasonably well in some of the
health indicators like decline in death rate from
25.1 per thousand in 1951 to 8.1 per thousand
in 1999 and infant mortality from 148 per
thousand to 70 during the same period.
Similarly, it also succeeded in increasing life
expectancy at birth from 37.1 years to 62.3
years for males and 36.2 to 65.3 years for
females from 1951 to 1999. Though, these are
great achievements, a lot needs to be done.
Similarly, it has also done reasonably well in
bringing down birth rate from 40.8 to 26.1
during the same years, but it still is much higher
than many developed countries.
The situation is more alarming when seen
in the context of gender specific and rural and
urban health indicators. India has recorded
declining female sex ratio. The findings of 2001
Census of India are very disturbing particularly
in case of child sex ratio between 0-6 age
groups. The other significant features of the
report are, with the exception of Kerala, the
child sex ratio has declined in all the states
and it is the most alarming in the developed
state of Haryana and Punjab where it is
below 800 female children per thousand
male children. What factors are responsible for
it? Is it the social attitude or scientific methods
of sex-determination?
Indicators of Social Empowerment
“Development is freedom”. Freedom from
hunger, poverty, servitude, bondage,
ignorance, illiteracy and any other forms of
domination is the key to human development.
Freedom in real sense of the term is possible
only with the empowerment and participation
of the people in the exercise of their capabilities
and choices in the society. Access to knowledge
about the society and environment are

while female literacy is 54.16 per cent.
Total literacy as well as female literacy
is higher than the national average in

There are wide regional disparities in
literacy rate across the states of India.
There is a state like Bihar which has
very low (47.53 per cent) literacy and
there are states like Kerala and
Mizoram which have literacy rates of
90.92 and 88.49 per cent respectively.
Apart from the spatial variations,
percentage of literates in the rural areas and
among the marginalised sections of our society
such as females, scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes, agricultural labourers, etc. is very low.
It is worth mentioning here that though, there
has been improvement in the percentage of
literates among the marginalised section yet the
gap between the richer and the marginalised
sections of the population has increased over
the years.

taking states and union territories as the unit
of analysis.
India has been placed among the
countries
showing
medium
human
development. What is the rank of India among
the 172 countries of the world? As indicated
in table 3.4 Kerala with the composite index
value of 0.638 is placed at the top rank
followed by Punjab (0.537), Tamil Nadu (0.531)
Maharashtra (0.523) and Haryana (0.509). As
expected, states like Bihar (0.367), Assam
(0.386), Uttar Pradesh (0.388), Madhya
Pradesh (0.394) and Orissa (0.404) are at the
bottom among the 15 major states in India.
There are several socio-political, economic
and historical reasons for such a state of
affairs. Kerala is able to record the highest value
in the HDI largely due to its impressive
performance in achieving near hundred per
cent literacy (90.92 per cent) in 2001. In a
different scenario the states like Bihar, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, Assam and Uttar Pradesh
have very low literacy. For example, total
literacy rate for Bihar was as low as 60.32 per
cent during the same year. States showing
higher total literacy rates have less gaps
between the male and female literacy rates. For
Kerala, it is 6.34 per cent, while it is 26.75 per
cent in Bihar and 25.95 per cent in Madhya
Pradesh.

Human Development
Apart from the educational attainment, the
levels of economic development too play
significant impacts on HDI. Economically
developed states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu
and Punjab and Haryana have higher value of
HDI as compared to states like Assam, Bihar,
Madhya Pradesh, etc.
Regional distortions and social
disparities which developed during the
colonial period continue to play an important
role in the Indian economy, polity and society.
The Government of India has made concerted
efforts to institutionalise the balanced
development with its main focus on social
distributive justice through planned
development. It has made significant
achievements in most of the fields but, these
are still below the desired level.

Development in general and human
development in particular is a complex concept
used in social sciences. It is complex because
for ages it was thought that development is a
substantive concept and once it is achieved it
will address all the socio-cultural and
environmental ills of the society. Though,
development has brought in significant
improvement in the quality of life in more than
one way but increasing regional disparities,
social inequalities, discriminations, deprivations,
displacement of people, abuse of human rights
and undermining human values and
environmental degradation have also increased.

India : People and Economy
Development Report 1993, tried to amend some
of the implicit biases and prejudices which were
entrenched in the concept of development.
People’s participation and their security were the
major issues in the Human Development Report
of 1993. It also emphasised on progressive
democratisation and increasing empowerment
of people as minimum conditions for human
development. The report recognised greater
constructive role of ‘Civil Societies’ in bringing
about peace and human development. The civil
society should work for building up opinion for
reduction in the military expenditure, de-
mobilisation of armed forces, transition from
defence to production of basic goods and services
and particularly disarmament and reduction in
the nuclear warheads by the developed
countries. In a nuclearised world, peace and
well-being are major global concerns.
At the other extreme of this approach lie
the views expressed by the Neo-Malthusians,
environmentalists and radical ecologists. They
believe that for a happy and peaceful social life
proper balance between population and
resources is a necessary condition. According
to these thinkers, the gap between the resources
and population has widened after eighteenth
century. There have been marginal expansion
in the resources of the world in the last three
hundred years but there has been phenomenal
growth in the human population. Development
has only contributed in increasing the multiple
uses of the limited resources of the world while
there has been enormous increase in the demand
for these resources. Therefore, the prime task
before any development activity is to maintain
parity between population and resources.
Scholar like Sir Robert Malthus was the first
one to voice his concern about the growing
scarcity of resources as compared to the human
population. Apparently this argument looks
logical and convincing, but a critical look will
reveal certain intrinsic flaws such as resources
are not a neutral category. It is not the
availability of resources that is as important as
their social distribution. Resources everywhere
are unevenly distributed. Rich countries and
people have access to large resource baskets
while the poor find their resources shrinking.
Moreover, unending pursuit for the control of
more and more resources by the powerful and
use of the same for exhibiting ones prowess  is
the prime cause of conflicts as well as the
apparent contradictions between population-
resource and development.
Indian culture and civilisation have been
very sensitive to the issues of population,
resource and development for a long time. It
would not be incorrect to say that the ancient
scriptures were essentially concerned about the
balance and harmony among the elements of
nature. Mahatma Gandhi in the recent times
advocated the reinforcement of the harmony and
balance between the two. He was quite
apprehensive about the on-going development
particularly the way industrialisation has
institutionalised the loss of morality, spirituality,
self-reliance, non-violence and mutual co-
operation and environment. In his opinion,
austerity for individual, trusteeship of social
wealth and non-violence are the key to attain
higher goals in the life of an individual as well as
that of a nation. His views were also re-echoed
in the Club of Rome Report “Limits to Growth”
(1972), Schumacher’s book “Small is
Beautiful” (1974), Brundtland Commission’s
Report “Our Common Future” (1987) and
finally in the “Agenda-21 Report of the Rio
Conference” (1993).

HUMAN
SETTLEMENTS
Human Settlement means cluster of dwellings
of any type or size where human beings live.
For this purpose, people may erect houses and
other structures and command some area or
territory as their economic support-base. Thus,
the process of settlement inherently involves
grouping of people and apportioning of territory
as their resource base.
Settlements vary in size and type. They
range from a hamlet to metropolitan cities. With
size, the economic character and social structure
of settlements changes and so do its ecology and
technology. Settlements could be small and
sparsely spaced; they may also be large and
closely spaced. The sparsely located small
settlements are called villages, specialising in
agriculture or other primary activities. On the
other hand, there are fewer but larger settlements
which are termed as urban settlements
specialising in secondary and tertiary activities.
The basic differences between rural and urban
settlements are as follows :
The rural settlements derive their life
support or basic economic needs from
land based primary economic activities,
whereas, urban settlements, depend on
processing of raw materials and
manufacturing of finished goods on the
one hand and a variety of services on the
other.
Cities act as nodes of economic growth,
provide goods and services not only to
urban dwellers but also to the people of
the rural settlements in their hinterlands
in return for food and raw materials. This
functional relationship between the urban
and rural settlements takes place through
transport and communication network.
Rural and urban settlements differ in
terms of social relationship, attitude and
outlook. Rural people are less mobile and
therefore, social relations among them are
intimate. In urban areas, on the other
hand, way of life is complex and fast, and
social relations are formal.

Semi-Clustered Settlements
Semi-clustered or fragmented settlements may
result from tendency of clustering in a
restricted area of dispersed settlement. More
often such a pattern may also result from
segregation or fragmentation of a large compact
village. In this case, one or more sections of
the village society choose or is forced to live a
little away from the main cluster or village. In
such cases, generally, the land-owning and
dominant community occupies the central part
of the main village, whereas people of lower
strata of society and menial workers settle on
the outer flanks of the village. Such settlements
are widespread in the Gujarat plain and some
parts of Rajasthan.
distance. In India compact or clustered village
of a few hundred houses is a rather universal
feature, particularly in the northern plains.
However, there are several areas, which have
other forms of rural settlements. There are
various factors and conditions responsible for
having different types of rural settlements in
India. These include: (i) physical features –
nature of terrain, altitude, climate and
availability of water (ii) cultural and ethenic
factors – social structure, caste and religion
(iii) security factors – defence against thefts and
robberies. Rural settlements in India can
broadly be put into four types:
•  Clustered, agglomerated or nucleated,
•  Semi-clustered or fragmented,
•  Hamleted, and
•  Dispersed or isolated.
Clustered Settlements
The clustered rural settlement is a compact or
closely built up area of houses. In this type of
village the general living area is distinct and
separated from the surrounding farms, barns
and pastures. The closely built-up area and its
intervening streets present some recognisable
pattern or geometric shape, such as
rectangular, radial, linear, etc. Such settlements
are generally found in fertile alluvial plains and
in the northeastern states. Sometimes, people
live in compact village for security or defence
reasons, such as in the Bundelkhand region of
central India and in Nagaland. In Rajasthan,
scarcity of water has necessitated compact
settlement for maximum utilisation of available
water resources.
Hamleted Settlements
Sometimes settlement is fragmented into several
units physically separated from each other
bearing a common name. These units are locally
called panna, para, palli, nagla, dhani, etc. in
various parts of the country. This segmentation
of a large village is often motivated by social
and ethnic factors. Such villages are more
frequently found in the middle and lower Ganga
plain, Chhattisgarh and lower valleys of the
Himalayas.
Dispersed Settlements
Dispersed or isolated settlement pattern in India
appears in the form of isolated huts or hamlets
of few huts in remote jungles, or on small hills

Ancient Towns
There are number of towns in India having
historical background spanning over 2000
years. Most of them developed as religious and
cultural centres. Varanasi is one of the important
towns among these. Prayag (Allahabad),
Pataliputra (Patna), Madurai are some other
examples of ancient towns in the country.
Medieval Towns
About 100 of the existing towns have their roots
in the medieval period. Most of them developed
as headquarters of principalities and kingdoms.
These are fort towns which came up on the
ruins of ancient towns. Important among them
are Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Agra
and Nagpur.
Modern Towns
The British and other Europeans have
developed a number of towns in India.
Starting their foothold on coastal locations,
they first developed some trading ports such
as Surat, Daman, Goa, Pondicherry, etc. The
British later consolidated their hold around
three principal nodes – Mumbai (Bombay),
Chennai (Madras), and Kolkata (Calcutta) –
and built them in the British style. Rapidly
with farms or pasture on the slopes. Extreme
dispersion of settlement is often caused by
extremely fragmented nature of the terrain and
land resource base of habitable areas. Many
areas of Meghalaya, Uttaranchal, Himachal
Pradesh and Kerala have this type of settlement.
Urban Settlements

Urban Settlements
Unlike rural settlements, urban settlements
are generally compact and larger in size.
They are engaged in a variety of non-
agricultural, economic and administrative
functions. As mentioned earlier, cities are
functionally linked to rural areas around
them. Thus, exchange of goods and services
is performed sometimes directly and
sometimes through a series of market towns
and cities. Thus, cities are connected directly
as well as indirectly with the villages and also
with each other. You can see the definition
of towns in Chapter 10 of the book,
“Fundamentals of Human Geography.”
Evolution of Towns in India
Towns flourished since prehistoric times in
India. Even at the time of Indus valley
civilisation, towns like Harappa and
Mohanjodaro were in existence. The following
period has witnessed evolution of towns. It
continued with periodic ups and downs until
the arrival of Europeans in India in the
eighteenth century. On the basis of their
evolution in different periods, Indian towns may
be classified as:
• Ancient towns, • Medieval towns, and
• Modern towns.

through control over the princely states, they
established their administrative centres, hill-
towns as summer resorts, and added new civil,

administrative and military areas to them.
Towns based on modern industries also
evolved after 1850. Jamshedpur can be cited
as an example.
After independence, a large number of
towns have been developed as administrative
headquarters, e.g. Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar,
Gandhinagar, Dispur, etc. and industrial
centres such as Durgapur, Bhilai, Sindri,
Barauni. Some old towns also developed
as satellite towns around metropolitan
cities such as Ghaziabad, Rohtak, Gurgaon
around Delhi. With increasing investment
in rural areas, a large number of medium
and small towns have developed all over
the country.
Urbanisation in India

Urbanisation in India
The level of urbanisation is measured in
terms of percentage of urban population to
total population. The level of urbanisation in
India in 2001 was 28 per cent, which is quite
low in comparison to developed countries.
Total urban population has increased eleven
fold during twentieth century. Enlargement
of urban centres and emergence of new towns
have played a significant role in the growth
of urban population and urbanisation in the
country. (Table 4.1). But the growth rate of
urbanisation has slowed down during last
two decades.
Classification of Towns on the basis of
Population Size
Census of India classifies urban centres into
six classes as presented in Table 4.2. Urban
centre with population of more than one lakh
is called a city or class I town. Cities
accommodating population size between one
to five million are called metropolitan cities and
more than five million are mega cities. Majority
of metropolitan and mega cities are urban
agglomerations. An urban agglomeration may
consist of any one of the following three

combinations: (i) a town and its adjoining
urban outgrowths, (ii) two or more
contiguous towns with or without their
outgrowths, and (iii) a city and one or more
adjoining towns with their outgrowths
together forming a contiguous spread.
Examples of urban outgrowth are railway
colonies, university campus, port area,
military cantonment, etc. located within the
revenue limits of a village or villages
contiguous to the town or city.
It is evident from Table 4.2 that more than
60 per cent of urban population in India lives
in Class I towns. Out of 423 cities, 35 cities/
urban agglomerations are metropolitan cities
(Fig.4.6). Six of them are mega cities with
population over five million each. More than
one-fifth (21.0%) of urban population lives in
these mega cities.
Among them, Greater Mumbai is the
largest agglomeration with 16.4 million
people. Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore
and Hyderabad are other mega cities in the
country.
Functional Classification of Towns
Apart from their role as central or nodal places,
many towns and cities perform specialised
services. Some towns and cities specialise in
certain functions and they are known for
some specific activities, products or services.
However, each town performs a number of
functions. On the basis of dominant or
specialised functions, Indian cities and towns
can be broadly classified as follows:

Administrative towns and cities
Towns supporting administrative headquarters
of higher order are administrative towns, such
as Chandigarh, New Delhi, Bhopal, Shillong,
Guwahati, Imphal, Srinagar, Gandhinagar,
Jaipur Chennai, etc.
Industrial towns
Industries constitute prime motive force of these
cities such as Mumbai, Salem, Coimbatore,
Modinagar, Jamshedpur, Hugli, Bhilai, etc.
Transport Cities
They may be ports primarily engaged in export
and import activities such as Kandla, Kochchi,
Kozhikode, Vishakhapatnam, etc. or hubs of
inland transport such as Agra, Dhulia, Mughal
Sarai, Itarsi, Katni, etc.
Commercial towns
Towns and cities specialising in trade and
commerce are kept in this class. Kolkata,
Saharanpur, Satna, etc. are some examples.
Mining towns
These towns have developed in mineral rich
areas such as Raniganj, Jharia, Digboi,
Ankaleshwar, Singrauli, etc.
Garrisson Cantonment towns
These towns emerged as garrisson towns such
as Ambala, Jalandhar, Mhow, Babina,
Udhampur, etc.

The cities are not static in their function. The
functions change due to their dynamic nature.

metropolises become multifunctional wherein
industry, business, administration, transport,

LAND RESOURCES
AND AGRICULTURE
You must have observed that the land around
you is put to different uses. Some land is
occupied by rivers, some may have trees and
on some parts roads and buildings have been
built. Different types of lands are suited to
different uses. Human beings thus, use land
as a resource for production as well as residence
and recreation. Thus, the building of your
school, roads on which you travel, parks in
which you play, fields in which crops are grown
and the pastures where animals graze represent
different uses to which land is put.
Land Use Categories

Land Use Categories
Land-use records are maintained by land
revenue department. The land use categories
add up to reporting area, which is somewhat
different from the geographical area. The
Survey of India is responsible for measuring
geographical area of administrative units in
India. Have you ever used a map prepared by
Survey of India? The difference between the two
concepts are that while the former changes
somewhat depending on the estimates of the
land revenue records, the latter does not change
and stays fixed as per Survey of India
measurements. You may be familiar with land
use categories as they are also included in your
Social Science textbook of Class X.
The land-use categories as maintained in
the Land Revenue Records are as follows :
Forests : It is important to note that
area under actual forest cover is
different from area classified as forest.
The latter is the area which the
Government has identified and
demarcated for forest growth. The land
revenue records are consistent with
the latter definition. Thus, there may
be an increase in this category without
any increase in the actual forest cover.
Land put to Non-agricultural Uses :
Land under settlements (rural and
urban), infrastructure (roads, canals,
etc.), industries, shops, etc. are
included in this category. An expansion
in the secondary and tertiary activities
2015-16
would lead to an increase in this
category of land-use.
(iii) Barren and Wastelands : The land
which may be classified as a
wasteland such as barren hilly
terrains, desert lands, ravines, etc.
normally cannot be brought under
cultivation with the available
technology.
(iv) Area under Permanent Pastures and
Grazing Lands : Most of this type land
is owned by the village ‘Panchayat’ or
the Government. Only a small
proportion of this land is privately
owned. The land owned by the village
panchayat comes under ‘Common
Property Resources’.
Area under Miscellaneous Tree
Crops and Groves(Not included is
Net sown Area) : The land under
orchards and fruit trees are included
in this category. Much of this land is
privately owned.
(vi) Culturable Waste-Land : Any land
which is left fallow (uncultivated) for
more than five years is included in this
category. It can be brought under
cultivation after improving it through
reclamation practices.
(vii) Current Fallow : This is the land
which is left without cultivation for one
or less than one agricultural year.
Fallowing is a cultural practice adopted
for giving the land rest. The land
recoups the lost fertility through natural
processes.
(viii) Fallow other than Current Fallow :
This is also a cultivable land which is
left uncultivated for more than a year
but less than five years. If the land is
left uncultivated for more than five
years, it would be categorised as
culturable wasteland.
(ix) Net Area Sown  : The physical
extent of land on which crops are
sown and harvested is known as net
sown area.
Land-use Changes in India
Land-use Changes in India
Land-use Changes in India
Land-use Changes in India
Land-use Changes in India
Land-use in a region, to a large extent, is
influenced by the nature of economic
activities carried out in that region. However,
while economic activities change over time,
land, like many other natural resources, is
fixed in terms of its area. At this stage, one
needs to appreciate three types of changes
that an economy undergoes, which affect
land-use.
The size of the economy (measured
in terms of value for all the goods and
services produced in the economy)
grows over time as a result of
increasing population, change in
income levels, available technology
and associated factors. As a result, the
pressure on land will increase with
time and marginal lands would come
under use.
Secondly, the composition of the
economy would undergo a change over
time. In other words, the secondary and
the tertiary sectors usually grow much
faster than the primary sector, specifically
the agricultural sector. This type of
change is common in developing
countries like India. This process would
result in a gradual shift of land from
agricultural uses to non-agricultural
uses. You would observe that such
changes are sharp around large urban
areas. The agricultural land is being used
for building purposes.
(iii)
Thirdly, though the contribution of the
agricultural activities reduces over time,
the pressure on land for agricultural
activities does not decline. The reasons
for continued pressure on agricultural
land are:
In developing countries, the
share of population dependent
on agriculture usually declines
much more slowly compared to
the decline in the sector’s share
in GDP.
(b) The number of people that the
agricultural sector has to feed is
increasing day by day.

India : People and Economy
Compare the change in shares of primary, secondary
and tertiary sectors in GDP between 1960-61 and 1999-
2000 with the changes of land-use between 1960-61
and 2008-09 using Appendix (vii) Tables 1 and 2.
India has undergone major changes within
the economy over the past four or five decades,
and this has influenced the land-use changes
in the country. These changes between 1960-
61 and 2008-09 have been shown in Fig. 5.1.
There are two points that you need to remember
before you derive some meaning from this
figure. Firstly, the percentages shown in the
figure have been derived with respect to the
reporting area. Secondly, since even the
reporting area has been relatively constant over
the years, a decline in one category usually
leads to an increase in some other category.
Four categories have undergone increases,
while four have registered declines. Share of
area under forest, area under non-agricultural
uses, current fallow lands and net area sown
have shown an increase. The following
observations can be made about these
increases:
The rate of increase is the highest in case
of area under non-agricultural uses. This
is due to the changing structure of
Indian economy, which is increasingly
depending on the contribution from
industrial and services sectors and
expansion of related infrastructural
facilities. Also, an expansion of area
under both urban and rural settlements
has added to the increase. Thus, the area
under non-agricultural uses is
increasing at the expense of wastelands
and agricultural land.
The increase in the share under forest,
as explained before, can be accounted
for by increase in the demarcated area
under forest rather than an actual
increase in the forest cover in the country.
(iii)
The increase in the current fallow cannot
be explained from information
pertaining to only two points. The trend
of current fallow fluctuates a great deal
over years, depending on the variability
of rainfall and cropping cycles.
The increase in net area sown is a recent
phenomenon due to use of culturable
waste land for agricultural pupose.
Before which it was registering a slow
decrease. There are indications that
most of the decline had occurred due to
the increases in area under non-
agricultural use. (Note : the expansion
of building activity on agricultural land
in your village and city).
Note : Categories (iv) and (v) of Section I have been clubbed together in the graph.
Fig. 5.1
2015-16
Land  Resources and  Agriculture      43
The four categories that have registered a
decline are barren and wasteland, culturable
wasteland, area under pastures and tree crops
and fallow lands.
The following explanations can be given
for the declining trends:
As the pressure on land increased, both
from the agricultural and non-
agricultural sectors, the wastelands and
culturable wastelands have witnessed
decline over time.
The decline in land under pastures and
grazing lands can be explained by
pressure from agricultural land. Illegal
encroachment due to expansion of
cultivation on common pasture lands is
largely responsible for this decline.
What is the difference between actual increase and
rate of increase? Work out the actual increase and
rate of increases for all the land use categories between
1960-61 and 2008-09 from the data given in the Appendix
(vii) (Table 1). Explain the results.
Note for Teacher
For calculating actual increase, the difference of the
land-use categories should be worked out over the two
periods.
For deriving the rate of increase, simple growth rate i.e.
(difference of values between the two time points i.e.
value of terminal year minus base year / base year or
1960-61 value) should be used, e.g.

Land, according to its ownership can broadly
be classified under two broad heads – private
land and common property resources (CPRs).
While the former is owned by an individual or a
group of individuals, the latter is owned by the
state meant for the use of the community. CPRs
provide fodder for the livestock and fuel for the
households along with other minor forest
products like fruits, nuts, fibre, medicinal
plants, etc. In rural areas, such land is of
particular relevance for the livelihood of the
landless and marginal farmers and other
weaker sections since many of them depend on
income from their livestock due to the fact that
they have limited access to land. CPRs also are
important for women as most of the fodder and
fuel collection is done by them in rural areas.
They have to devote long hours in collecting fuel
and fodder from a degraded area of CPR.
CPRs can be defined as community’s natural
resource, where every member has the right of
access and usage with specified obligations,
without anybody having property rights over
them. Community forests, pasture lands, village
water bodies and other public spaces where a
group larger than a household or family unit
exercises rights of use and carries responsibility
of management are examples of CPRs.

Land resource is more crucial to the livelihood
of the people depending on agriculture:
Agriculture is a purely land based
activity unlike secondary and tertiary
activities. In other words, contribution
of land in agricultural output is more
compared to its contribution in the
outputs in the other sectors. Thus, lack
of access to land is directly correlated
with incidence of poverty in rural areas.
Quality of land has a direct bearing on
the productivity of agriculture, which is
not true for other activities.
(iii)
In rural areas, aside from its value as a
productive factor, land ownership has
a social value and serves as a security
for credit, natural hazards or life
contingencies, and also adds to the social
status.
An estimation of the total stock of
agricultural land resources (i.e. total cultivable
land) can be arrived at by adding up net sown
area, all fallow lands and culturable wasteland.
It may be observed from Table 5.1 that over the
years, there has been a marginal decline in the
available total stock of cultivable land as a
percentage to total reporting area. There has been
a greater decline of cultivated land, in spite of a
corresponding decline of cultivable wasteland.
2015-16
India : People and Economy
It is clear from the above discussion that
the scope for bringing in additional land under
net sown area in India is limited. There is, thus,
an urgent need to evolve and adopt land-saving
technologies. Such technologies can be classified
under two heads – those which raise the yield
of any particular crop per unit area of land and
those which increase the total output per unit
area of land from all crops grown over one
agricultural year by increasing land-use
intensity. The advantage of the latter kind of
technology is that along with increasing output
from limited land, it also increases the demand
for labour significantly. For a land scarce but
labour abundant country like India, a high
cropping intensity is desirable not only for fuller
utilisation of land resource, but also for
reducing unemployment in the rural economy.
The cropping intensity (CI) is calculated as
follows :
Cropping Intensity in percentage
Cropping Seasons in India
There are three distinct crop
seasons in the northern and
interior parts of country, namely
kharif, rabi and zaid.  The kharif
season largely coincides with
Southwest Monsoon under which
the cultivation of tropical crops
such as rice, cotton, jute, jowar,
bajra and tur is possible. The rabi
season begins with the onset of
winter in October-November and
ends in March-April.  The low
temperature conditions during
this season facilitate the cultivation of temperate
and subtropical crops such as wheat, gram and
mustard. Zaid is a short duration summer
cropping season beginning after harvesting of
rabi crops. The cultivation of watermelons,
cucumbers, vegetables and fodder crops during
this season is done on irrigated lands. However,
this type of distinction in the cropping season
does not exist in southern parts of the country.
Here, the temperature is high enough to grow
tropical crops during any period in the year
provided the soil moisture is available.
Therefore, in this region same crops can be
grown thrice in an agricultural year provided
there is sufficient soil moisture.
Types of Farming
On the basis of main source of moisture for
crops, the farming can be classified as irrigated
and rainfed (barani).  There is difference in the
nature of irrigated farming as well based on
objective of irrigation, i.e. protective or
productive. The objective of protective irrigation

is to protect the crops from adverse effects of soil
moisture deficiency which often means that
irrigation acts as a supplementary source of water
over and above the rainfall.  The strategy of this
kind of irrigation is to provide soil moisture to
maximum possible area.  Productive irrigation is
meant to provide sufficient soil moisture in the
cropping season to achieve high productivity.  In
such irrigation the water input per unit area of
cultivated land is higher than protective irrigation.
Rainfed farming is further classified on the basis
of adequacy of soil moisture during cropping
season into dryland and wetland farming. In
India, the dryland farming is largely confined
to the regions having annual rainfall less than 75
cm.  These regions grow hardy and drought
resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, moong, gram
and guar (fodder crops) and practise various
measures of soil moisture conservation and rain
water harvesting.  In wetland farming, the
rainfall is in excess of soil moisture requirement
of plants during rainy season. Such regions may
face flood and soil erosion hazards.  These areas
grow various water intensive crops such as rice,
jute and sugarcane and practise aquaculture in
the fresh water bodies.
Foodgrains
The importance of foodgrains in Indian
agricultural economy may be gauged from the
fact these crops occupy about two-third of total
cropped area in the country. Foodgrains are
dominant crops in all parts of the country
whether they have subsistence or commercial
agricultural economy. On the basis of the
structure of grain the foodgrains are classified
as cereals and pulses.
Cereals
The cereals occupy about 54 per cent of total
cropped area in India.  The country produces
about 11 per cent cereals of the world and ranks
third in production after China and U.S.A.  India
produces a variety of cereals, which are
classified as fine grains (rice, wheat) and coarse
grains (jowar, bajra, maize, ragi), etc. Account
of important cereals has been given in the
following paragraphs :
Rice is a staple food for the overwhelming
majority of population in India. Though, it is
considered to be a crop of tropical humid areas,
it has about 3,000 varieties which are grown in
different agro-climatic regions. These are
successfully grown from sea level to about
2,000 m altitude and from humid areas in
eastern India to dry but irrigated areas of
Punjab, Haryana, western U.P. and northern
Rajasthan. In southern states and West Bengal
the climatic conditions allow the cultivation of
two or three crops of rice in an agricultural year.
In West Bengal farmers grow three crops of rice
called ‘aus’, ‘aman’ and ‘boro’.  But in
Himalayas and northwestern parts of the
country, it is grown as a kharif crop during
southwest Monsoon season.
India contributes 21.6 per cent of rice
production in the world and ranked second
after China in 2008-09.  About one-fourth of
the total cropped area in the country is under
rice cultivation. West Bengal, Punjab and
Uttar Pradesh were the leading rice producing
states in the country in 2009-10.  The yield level
of rice is high in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Haryana,
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal and
Kerala.  In the first four of these states almost the
entire land under rice cultivation is irrigated.
Punjab and Haryana are not traditional rice
growing areas. Rice cultivation in the irrigated
areas of Punjab and Haryana was introduced
in 1970s following the Green Revolution.
Genetically improved varieties of seed, relatively
high usage of fertilisers and pesticides and lower
levels of susceptibility of the crop to pests due

to dry climatic conditions are responsible for
higher yield of rice in this region.  The yield of
this crop is very low in rainfed areas of Madhya
Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.
Wheat
Wheat is the second most important cereal crop
in India after rice. India produces about 12 per
cent of total wheat production of world. It is
primarily a crop of temperate zone.  Hence, its
cultivation in India is done during winter i.e.
rabi season. About 85 per cent of total area
under this crop is concentrated in north and
central regions of the country i.e. Indo-Gangetic
Plain, Malwa Plateau and Himalayas up to
2,700 m altitude. Being a rabi crop, it is mostly
grown under irrigated conditions.  But it is a
rainfed crop in Himalayan highlands and parts
of Malwa plateau in Madhya Pradesh.
About 14 per cent of the total cropped area
in the country is under wheat cultivation. Uttar
Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh are five leading wheat
producing states.  The yield level of wheat is
very high (above 4,000 k.g. per ha) in Punjab
and Haryana whereas, Uttar Pradesh,
Rajasthan and Bihar have moderate yields. The
states like Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh
and Jammu and Kashmir growing wheat under
rainfed conditions have low yield.
Jowar
The coarse cereals together occupy about
16.50 per cent of total cropped area in the
country. Among these, jowar or sorghum alone
accounts for about 5.3 per cent of total
cropped area. It is main food crop in semi-arid
areas of central and southern India.
Maharashtra alone produces more than half
of the total jowar production of the country.
Other leading producer states of jowar are
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh
and Telangana.  It is sown in both kharif and
rabi seasons in southern states. But it is a
kharif crop in northern India where it is mostly
grown as a fodder crop. South of Vindhyachal
it is a rainfed crop and its yield level is very
low in this region.
Bajra
Bajra is sown in hot and dry climatic conditions
in northwestern and western parts of the
country. It is a hardy crop which resists frequent
dry spells and drought in this region.  It is
cultivated alone as well as part of mixed
cropping. This coarse cereal occupies about 5.2
per cent of total cropped area in the country.
Leading producers of bajra are the states of
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan
and Haryana. Being a rainfed crop, the yield level
of this crop is low in Rajasthan and fluctuates a
lot from year to year.  Yield of this crop has
increased during recent years in Haryana and
Gujarat due to introduction of drought resistant
varieties and expansion of irrigation under it.
Maize
Maize is a food as well as fodder crop grown
under semi-arid climatic conditions and over
inferior soils.  This crop occupies only about
3.6 per cent of total cropped area.  Maize
cultivation is not concentrated in any specific
region. It is sown all over India except eastern
and north-eastern regions.  The leading
producers of maize are the states of Madhya
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,
Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  Yield
level of maize is higher than other coarse cereals.
It is high in southern states and declines
towards central parts.
Pulses
Pulses are a very important ingredient of
vegetarian food as these are rich sources of
proteins. These are legume crops which
increase the natural fertility of soils through
nitrogen fixation. India is a leading producer of
pulses and accounts for about one-fifth of the
total production of pulses in the world. The
cultivation of pulses in the country is largely
concentrated in the drylands of Deccan and
central plateaus and northwestern parts of the
country. Pulses occupy about 11 per cent of
the total cropped area in the country. Being the
rainfed crops of drylands, the yields of pulses
are low and fluctuate from year to year. Gram
and tur are the main pulses cultivated in India.

Gram is cultivated in subtropical areas. It is
mostly a rainfed crop cultivated during rabi
season in central, western and northwestern parts
of the country. Just one or two light showers or
irrigations are required to grow this crop
successfully. It has been displaced from the
cropping pattern by wheat in Haryana, Punjab
and northern Rajasthan following the green
revolution. At present, gram covers only about
2.8 per cent of the total cropped area in the
country. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and
Rajasthan are the main producers of this pulse
crop. The yield of this crop continues to be low
and fluctuates from year to year even in irrigated
areas.
Tur (Arhar)
Tur is the second important pulse crop in the
country. It is also known as red gram or pigeon
pea. It is cultivated over marginal lands and
under rainfed conditions in the dry areas of
central and southern states of the country.  This
crop occupies only about 2 per cent of total
cropped area of India. Maharashtra alone
contributes about one-third of the total
production of tur. Other leading producer states
are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and
Madhya Pradesh. Per hectare output of this crop
is very low and its performance is inconsistent.
Differentiate between different foodgrains. Mix grains of
various kinds and separate cereals from pulses. Also,
separate fine from coarse cereals.
Oilseeds
The oilseeds are produced for extracting edible
oils. Drylands of Malwa plateau, Marathwada,
Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, Rayalseema
region of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
plateau are oilseeds growing regions of India.
These crops together occupy about 14 per cent
of total cropped area in the country.
Groundnut, rapeseed and mustard, soyabean
and sunflower are the main oilseed crops grown
in India.
Groundnut
India produces about 18.8 per cent of the total
groundnut production in the world (2008-09).
It is largely a rainfed kharif crop of drylands.
But in southern India, it is cultivated during rabi
season as well.  It covers about 3.6 per cent of
total cropped area in the country. Gujarat, Tamil
Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka
and Maharashtra are the leading producers.
Yield of groundnut is comparatively high in
Tamil Nadu where it is partly irrigated.  But its
yield is low in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka.
Rapeseed and Mustard
Rapeseed and mustard comprise several oilseeds
as rai, sarson, toria and taramira.  These are
subtropical crops cultivated during rabi season
in north-western and central parts of India.
These are frost sensitive crops and their yields
fluctuate from year to year.  But with the
expansion of irrigation and improvement in seed
technology, their yields have improved and
stabilised to some extent. About two-third of the
cultivated area under these crops is irrigated.
These oilseeds together occupy only 2.5 per cent
of total cropped area in the country. Rajasthan
contributes about one-third production while
other leading producers are Uttar Pradesh,
Haryana, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
Yields of these crops are comparatively high in
Haryana and Rajasthan.
Other Oilseeds
Soyabean and sunflower are other important
oilseeds grown in India.  Soyabean is mostly
grown in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Land  Resources and  Agriculture      51
These two states together produce about 90 per
cent of total output of soyabean in the country.
Sunflower cultivation is concentrated in
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and
adjoining areas of Maharashtra. It is a minor
crop in northern parts of the country where its
yield is high due to irrigation.
Fibre Crops
These crops provide us fibre for preparing cloth,
bags, sacks and a number of other items.
Cotton and jute are two main fibre crops grown
in India.
Cotton
Cotton is a tropical crop grown in kharif season
in semi-arid areas of the country.  India lost a
large proportion of cotton growing area to
Pakistan during partition.  However, its acreage
has increased considerably during the last 50
years.  India grows both short staple (Indian)
cotton as well as long staple (American) cotton
called ‘narma’ in north-western parts of the
country. Cotton requires clear sky during
flowering stage.
in south. Leading producers of this crop are
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh,
Punjab and Haryana. Per hectare output of
cotton is high under irrigated conditions in
north-western region of the country.  Its yield
is very low in Maharashtra where it is grown
under rainfed conditions.
Jute is used for making coarse cloth, bags, sacks
and decorative items.  It is a cash crop in West
Bengal and adjoining eastern parts of the
country.  India lost large jute growing areas to
East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during partition. At
present, India produces about three-fifth of jute
production of the world. West Bengal accounts
for about three-fourth of the production in the
country.  Bihar and Assam are other jute growing
areas. Being concentrated only in a few states,
this crop accounts for only about 0.5 per cent of
total cropped area in the country.
Other Crops
Sugarcane, tea and coffee are other important
crops grown in India.
Sugarcane
Sugarcane is a crop of tropical areas.  Under
rainfed conditions, it is cultivated in sub-humid
and humid climates. But it is largely an irrigated
crop in India. In Indo-Gangetic plain, its
cultivation is largely concentrated in Uttar
Pradesh. Sugarcane growing area in western
India is spread over Maharashtra and Gujarat.
India ranks fourth in the world in the
production of cotton after China, U.S.A. and
Pakistan and accounts for about 8.3 per cent
of production of cotton in the world.  Cotton
occupies about 4.7 per cent of total cropped
area in the country. There are three cotton
growing areas, i.e. parts of Punjab, Haryana and
northern Rajasthan in north-west, Gujarat and
Maharashtra in the west and plateaus of
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu

Land  Resources and  Agriculture      53
In southern India, it is cultivated in irrigated
tracts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana
and Andhra Pradesh.
India was the second largest producer of
sugarcane after Brazil in 2008-09. It accounts
for about 23 per cent of the world production
of sugarcane.  But it occupies only 2.4 per cent
of total cropped area in the country. Uttar
Pradesh produces about two-fifth of sugarcane
of the country.  Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil
Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are other
leading producers of this crop where yield level
of sugarcane is high. Its yield is low in northern
India.
Tea is a plantation crop used as beverage. Black
tea leaves are fermented whereas green tea leaves
are unfermented. Tea leaves have rich content of
caffeine and tannin. It is an indigenous crop of
hills in northern China. It is grown over
undulating topography of hilly areas and well-
drained soils in humid and sub-humid tropics
and sub-tropics. In India, tea plantation started
in 1840s in Brahmaputra valley of Assam which
still is a major tea growing area in the country.
Later on, its plantation was introduced in the
sub-Himalayan region of West Bengal (Darjiling,
Jalpaiguri and Cooch Bihar districts).  Tea is also
cultivated on the lower slopes of Nilgiri and
after Sri Lanka and China. Assam accounts for
about 53.2 per cent of the total cropped area and
contributes more than half of total production of
tea in the country. West Bengal and Tamil Nadu
are the other leading producers of tea.
Coffee
Coffee is a tropical plantation crop. Its seeds
are roasted, ground and are used for preparing
a beverage. There are three varieties of coffee
i.e. arabica, robusta and liberica. India mostly
grows superior quality coffee, arabica, which
is in great demand in International market. But
India produces only about 3.2 per cent coffee
of the world and ranks seventh after Brazil,
Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, Ethopia and
Mexico in 2008-09. Coffee is cultivated in the
highlands of Western Ghats in Karnataka,
Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Karnataka alone
accounts for more than two-third of total
production of coffee in the country.
Agricultural Development in India

Agricultural Development in India
Agriculture continues to be an important sector
of Indian economy. In 2001 about 53 per cent
population of the country was dependent on it.
The importance of agricultural sector in India
can be gauged from the fact that about 57 per
cent of its land is devoted to crop cultivation,
whereas, in the world, the corresponding share
is only about 12 per cent. In spite of this, there
is tremendous pressure on agricultural land
in India, which is reflected from the fact that
the land-human ratio in the country is only 0.31
ha which is almost half of that of the world as a
whole (0.59 ha). Despite various constraints,
Indian agriculture has marched a long way
since Independence.
Strategy of Development
Indian agricultural economy was largely
subsistence in nature before Independence.  It
had dismal performance in the first half of
twentieth century. This period witnessed severe
droughts and famines.  During partition about
one-third of the irrigated land in undivided
India went to Pakistan. This reduced the
proportion of irrigated area in Independent

Cardamom hills in Western Ghats. India is a
leading producer of tea and accounts for about
28 per cent of total production in the world.
India’s share in the international market of tea
has declined substantially. At present, it ranks
third among tea exporting countries in the world

India. After Independence, the immediate goal
of the Government was to increase foodgrains
production by (i) switching over from cash
crops to food crops; (ii) intensification of
cropping over already cultivated land; and (iii)
increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable
and fallow land under plough. Initially, this
strategy helped in increasing foodgrains
production. But agricultural production
stagnated during late 1950s. To overcome this
problem, Intensive Agricultural District
Programme (IADP) and Intensive Agricultural
Area Programme (IAAP) were launched. But two
consecutive droughts during mid-1960s
resulted in food crisis in the country.
Consequently, the foodgrains were imported
from other countries.
New seed varieties of wheat (Mexico) and
rice (Philippines) known as high yielding
varieties (HYVs) were available for cultivation
by mid-1960s. India took advantage of this and
introduced package technology comprising
HYVs, along with chemical fertilizers in irrigated
areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Assured
supply of soil moisture through irrigation was
a basic pre-requisite for the success of this new
agricultural technology. This strategy of
agricultural development paid dividends
instantly and increased the foodgrains
production at very fast rate. This spurt of
agricultural growth came to be known as
‘Green Revolution’. This also gave fillip to the
development of a large number of agro-inputs,
agro-processing industries and small-scale
industries. This strategy of agricultural
development made the country self-reliant in
foodgrain production. But green revolution was
initially confined to irrigated areas only.  This
led to regional disparities in agricultural
development in the country till the seventies,
after which the technology spread to the Eastern
and Central parts of the country.
The Planning Commission of India
focused its attention on the problems of
agriculture in rainfed areas in 1980s.  It
initiated agro-climatic planning in 1988 to
induce regionally balanced agricultural
development in the country. It also emphasised
the need for diversification of agriculture and
harnessing of resources for development of
dairy farming, poultry, horticulture, livestock
rearing and aquaculture.
Initiation of the policy of liberalisation and
free market economy in 1990s is likely to
influence the course of development of Indian
agriculture. Lack of development of rural
infrastructure, withdrawal of subsidies and
price support, and impediments in availing of
the rural credits may lead to inter-regional and
inter-personal disparities in rural areas.
Growth of Agricultural Output and Technology
There has been a significant increase in
agricultural output and improvement in
technology during the last fifty years.
Production and yield of many crops
such as rice and wheat has increased at
an impressive rate. Among the other
crops, the production of sugarcane,
oilseeds and cotton has also increased
appreciably. India ranked first in the
production of pulses and jute in
2008-09. It is the second largest-
producer of rice, wheat, groundnut,
sugarcane and vegetables.
Expansion of irrigation has played a very
crucial role in enhancing agricultural
output in the country. It provided basis
for introduction of modern agricultural
technology such as high yielding varieties
of seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and
farm machinery. The net irrigated area in
the country has increased from 20.85 to
54.66 million ha over the period 1950-51
to 2000-01. Over these 50 years, area
irrigated more than once in an agricultural
year has increased from 1.71 to 20.46
million ha.
Modern agricultural technology has
diffused very fast in various areas of the
country. Consumption of chemical
fertilizers has increased by 15 times since
mid-sixties. In 2001-02, per hectare
consumption of chemical fertilizers in India
was 91 kg which was equal to its average
consumption in the world (90 kg). But in
the irrigated areas of Punjab and Haryana,

Low productivity
The yield of the crops in the country is low in
comparison to the international level. Per
hectare output of most of the crops such as
rice, wheat, cotton and oilseeds in India is
much lower than that of U.S.A., Russia and
Japan. Because of the very high pressure on
the land resources, the labour productivity
in Indian agriculture is also very low in
comparison to international level. The vast
rainfed areas of the country, particularly
drylands which mostly grow coarse cereals,
pulses and oilseeds have very low yields.
Why is agricultural productivity low in dry
regions?
Constraints of Financial Resources and
Indebtedness
The inputs of modern agriculture are very
expensive. This resource intensive approach has
become unmanageable for marginal and small
farmers as they have very meagre or no saving
to invest in agriculture. To tide over these
difficulties, most of such farmers have resorted
to availing credit from various institutions and
money lenders. Crop failures and low returns
from agriculture have forced them to fall in the
trap of indebtedness.
What are the implications of severe
indebtedness? Do you feel that the recent
incidents of farmers’ suicides in different
states of the country are the result of
indebtedness?
Lack of Land Reforms
Indian peasantry had been exploited for a
long time as there had been unequal
distribution of land. Among the three
revenue systems operational during British
period i.e. Mahalwari, Ryotwari and
Zamindari, the last one was most exploitative
for the peasants. After independence, land
reforms were accorded priority, but these
the consumption of chemical fertilizers per
unit area is three to four times higher than
that of the national average. Since the high
yielding varieties are highly susceptible to
pests and diseases, the use of pesticides
has increased significantly since 1960s.

The nature of problems faced by Indian
agriculture varies according to agro-ecological
and historical experiences of its different regions.
Hence, most of the agricultural problems in the
country are region specific. Yet, there are some
problems which are common and range from
physical constraints to institutional hindrances.
A detailed discussion on these problems follows:
Dependence on Erratic Monsoon
Irrigation covers only about 33 per cent of the
cultivated area in India. The crop production
in rest of the cultivated land directly depends
on rainfall. Poor performance of south-west
Monsoon also adversely affects the supply of
canal water for irrigation. On the other hand,
the rainfall in Rajasthan and other drought
prone areas is too meagre and highly unreliable.
Even the areas receiving high annual rainfall
experience considerable fluctuations. This
makes them vulnerable to both droughts and
floods. Drought is a common phenomenon in
the low rainfall areas which may also experience
occasional floods. The flash floods in drylands
of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan in
2006 are examples of this phenomenon.
Droughts and floods continue to be twin menace
in Indian agriculture.
2015-16

reforms were not implemented effectively due
to lack of strong political will. Most of the state
governments avoided taking politically tough
decisions which went against strong political
lobbies of landlords. Lack of implementation
of land reforms has resulted in continuation
of inequitous distribution of cultivable land
which is detrimental to agricultural
development.
Small Farm Size and Fragmentation of
Landholdings
There are a large number of marginal and small
farmers in the country. More than 60 per cent
of the ownership holdings have a size smaller
than one (ha). Furthermore, about 40 per cent
of the farmers have operational holding size
smaller than 0.5 hectare (ha).  The average size
of land holding is shrinking further under
increasing population pressure. Furthermore,
in India, the land holdings are mostly
fragmented. There are some states where
consolidation of holding has not been carried
out even once. Even the states where it has been
carried out once, second consolidation is
required as land holdings have fragmented
again in the process of division of land among
the owners of next generations. The small size
fragmented landholdings are uneconomic.
Lack of Commercialisation
A large number of farmers produce crops for
self-consumption. These farmers do not have
enough land resources to produce more than
their requirement. Most of the small and
marginal farmers grow foodgrains, which are

Vast Under-employment
There is a massive under-employment in the
agricultural sector in India, particularly in the
un-irrigated tracts. In these areas, there is a
seasonal unemployment ranging from 4 to 8
months. Even in the cropping season work is
not available throughout, as agricultural
operations are not labour intensive. Hence, the
people engaged in agriculture do not have the
opportunity to work round the year.
Degradation of Cultivable Land
One of the serious problems that arises out of
faulty strategy of irrigation and agricultural
development is degradation of land resources.
This is serious because it may lead to
depletion of soil fertility. The situation is
particularly alarming in irrigated areas. A large
tract of agricultural land has lost its fertility
due to alkalisation and salinisation of soils and
waterlogging. Alkalinity and salinity have
already affected about 8 million ha land.
Another 7 million ha land in the country has
lost its fertility due to waterlogging. Excessive
use of chemicals such as insecticides and
pesticides has led to their concentration in toxic
amounts in the soil profile. Leguminous crops
have been displaced from the cropping pattern
in the irrigated areas and duration of fallow
has substantially reduced owing to multiple
cropping. This has obliterated the process of
natural fertilization such as nitrogen fixation.
Rainfed areas in humid and semi-arid tropics
also experience degradation of several types
like soil erosion by water and wind erosion
which are often induced by human activities.

WATER RESOURCES
Do you think that what exists today will
continue to be so, or the future is going to be
different in some respects? It can be said with
some certainty that the societies will witness
demographic transition, geographical shift of
population, technological advancement,
degradation of environment and water scarcity.
Water scarcity is possibly to pose the greatest
challenge on account of its increased demand
coupled with shrinking supplies due to over
utilisation and pollution. Water is a cyclic
resource with abundant supplies on the globe.
Approximately, 71 per cent of the earth’s
surface is covered with it but fresh water
constitutes only about 3 per cent of the total
water.  In fact, a very small proportion of fresh
water is effectively available for human use. The
availability of fresh water varies over space and
time. The tensions and disputes on sharing and
control of this scare resource are becoming
contested issues among communities, regions,
and states. The assessment, efficient use and
conservation of water, therefore, become
necessary to ensure development.  In this
chapter, we shall discuss water resources in
India, its geographical distribution, sectoral
utilisation, and methods of its conservation and
management.
Water Resources of India

Water Resources of India
Water Resources of India
India accounts for about 2.45 per cent of world’s
surface area, 4 per cent of the world’s water
resources and about 16 per cent of world’s
population. The total water available from
precipitation in the country in a year is about
4,000 cubic km. The availability from surface
water and replenishable groundwater is 1,869
cubic km. Out of this only 60 per cent can be
put to beneficial uses. Thus, the total utilisable
water resource in the country is only 1,122
cubic km.
Surface Water Resources
There are four major sources of surface water.
These are rivers, lakes, ponds, and tanks. In
the country, there are about 10,360 rivers
and their tributaries longer than 1.6 km each.
The mean annual flow in all the river basins
in India is estimated to be 1,869 cubic km.
2015-16
harnessed, but it is yet to be done in the
Brahmaputra and the Ganga basins.
Groundwater Resources
The total replenishable groundwater
resources in the country are about 432 cubic
km. Table 6.1 shows that the Ganga and the
Brahamaputra basins, have about 46 per
cent of the total replenishable groundwater
resources. The level of groundwater
utilisation is relatively high in the river basins
lying in north-western region and parts of
south India.
The groundwater utilisation is very high
in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan,
and Tamil Nadu. However, there are States like
Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Kerala, etc., which utilise
only a small proportion of their groundwater
potentials. States like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Tripura and Maharashtra are utilising
their ground water resources at a moderate
rate. If the present trend continues, the
However, due to topographical, hydrological
and other constraints, only about 690 cubic
km (32 per cent) of the available surface water
can be utilised. Water flow in a river depends
on size of its catchment area or river basin
and rainfall within its catchment area. You
have studied in your Class XI textbook “India
: Physical Environment” that precipitation in
India has very high spatial variation, and it is
mainly concentrated in Monsoon season. You
also have studied in the textbook that some
of the rivers in the country like the Ganga,
the Brahmaputra, and the Indus have huge
catchment areas. Given that precipitation is
relatively high in the catchment areas of the
Ganga, the Brahmaputra and the Barak
rivers, these rivers, although account for only
about one-third of the total area in the
country, have 60 per cent of the total surface
water resources. Much of the annual water
flow in south Indian rivers like the Godavari,
the Krishna, and the Kaveri has been

Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal have vast
surface water resources in these lagoons and
lakes.  Although, water is generally brackish in
these water-bodies, it is used for fishing and
irrigating certain varieties of paddy crops,
coconut, etc.
Water Demand and Utilisation
India has traditionally been an agrarian
economy, and about two-third of its population
have been dependent on agriculture. Hence,
development of irrigation to increase agricultural
production has been assigned a very high
priority in the Five Year Plans, and multipurpose
river valleys projects like the Bhakra-Nangal,
Hirakud, Damodar Valley, Nagarjuna Sagar,
Indira Gandhi Canal Project, etc. have been taken
up. In fact, India’s water demand at present is
dominated by irrigational needs.
As shown in Fig. 6.2 and 6.3, agriculture
accounts for most of the surface and ground
water utilisation, it accounts for 89 per cent of
the surface water and 92 per cent of the
groundwater utilisation. While the share of
industrial sector is limited to 2 per cent of the
surface water utilisation and 5 per cent of the
ground-water, the share of domestic sector is
higher (9 per cent) in surface water utilisation
as compared to groundwater. The share of

Lagoons and Backwaters
India has a vast coastline and the coast is very
indented in some states. Due to this, a number
of lagoons and lakes have formed. The States like
Fig. 6.3 : Sectoral Usage of Groundwater

India : People and Economy
agricultural sector in total water utilisation is
much higher than other sectors. However, in
future, with development, the shares of
industrial and domestic sectors in the country
are likely to increase.
Demand of Water for Irrigation
In agriculture, water is mainly used for
irrigation. Irrigation is needed because of
spatio-temporal variability in rainfall in the
country. The large tracts of the country are
deficient in rainfall and are drought prone.
North-western India and Deccan plateau
constitute such areas. Winter and summer
seasons are more or less dry in most part of
the country. Hence, it is difficult to practise
agriculture without assured irrigation during
dry seasons. Even in the areas of ample
rainfall like West Bengal and Bihar, breaks
in monsoon or its failure creates dry spells
detrimental for agriculture. Water need of
certain crops also makes irrigation necessary.
For instance, water requirement of rice,
sugarcane, jute, etc. is very high which can
be met only through irrigation.
Provision of irrigation makes multiple
cropping possible. It has also been found that
irrigated lands have higher agricultural
productivity than unirrigated land. Further, the
high yielding varieties of crops need regular
moisture supply, which is made possible only
by a developed irrigation systems. In fact, this
is why that green revolution strategy of
agriculture development in the country has
largely been successful in Punjab, Haryana and
western Uttar Pradesh.

In Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar

are grown mainly with the help of irrigation in
these states. Of the total net irrigated area 76.1
per cent in Punjab and 51.3 per cent in Haryana
are irrigated through wells and tube wells. This
shows that these states utilise large proportion
of their ground water potential which has
resulted in ground water depletion in these
states. The share of area irrigated through wells
and tube wells is also very high in the states
given in table 6.2.
What is the pattern of well and Tube-well
irrigation discernible from the above table?
What are the implications of using ground
water in drought prone area of Rajasthan,
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu?
The over-use of ground water resources
has led to decline in ground water table in these
states. In fact, over withdrawals in some states
like Rajasthan, and Maharashtra has increased
fluoride concentration in ground-water, and this
practice has led to increase in concentration of
arsenic in parts of West Bengal and Bihar.
Intensive irrigation in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar
Pradesh is increasing salinity in the soil and depletion
of ground water irrigation. Discuss its likely impacts on
agriculture.
Emerging Water Problems
The per capita availability of water is dwindling
day by day due to increase in population. The
available water resources are also getting
polluted with industrial, agricultural and
domestic effluents, and this, in turn, is further
limiting the availability of usable water
resources.

Deterioration of Water Quality
Water quality refers to purity of water, or water
without unwanted foreign substances. Water
gets polluted by foreign matters such as micro-
organisms, chemicals, industrial and other
wastes.  Such matters deteriorate the quality of
water and render it unfit for human use. When
toxic substances enter lakes, streams, rivers,
ocean and other water bodies, they get dissolved
or lie suspended in water. This results in pollution
of water whereby quality of water deteriorates
affecting aquatic systems. Sometimes, these
pollutants also seep down and pollute
groundwater.  The Ganga and the Yamuna are
the two highly polluted rivers in the country.
Find out which are the major towns/cities located on
the bank of the Ganga and its tributaries and major
industries they have.
Water Conservation and Management
Since there is a declining availability of fresh
water and increasing demand, the need has
arisen to conserve and effectively manage this
precious life giving resource for sustainable
development. Given that water availability from
sea/ocean, due to high cost of desalinisation,
is considered negligible, India has to take quick
steps and make effective policies and laws, and
adopt effective measures for its conservation.
Besides developing water saving technologies
and methods, attempts are also to be made to
prevent the pollution. There is need to
encourage watershed development, rainwater
harvesting, water recycling and reuse, and
conjunctive use of water for sustaining water
supply in long run.
2015-16
India : People and Economy
Discuss the issues highlighted in the
news items.
Prevention of Water Pollution
Available water resources are degrading
rapidly.  The major rivers of the country
generally retain better water quality in less
densely populated upper stretches in hilly
areas. In plains, river water is used intensively
for irrigation, drinking, domestic and industrial
purposes. The drains carrying agricultural
(fertilisers and insecticides), domestic (solid and
liquid wastes), and industrial effluents join the
rivers. The concentration of pollutants in rivers,
especially remains very high during the summer
season when flow of water is low.
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
in collaboration with State Pollution Control
Boards has been monitoring water quality of
national aquatic resources at 507 stations. The
data obtained from these stations show that
organic and bacterial contamination continues
to be the main source of pollution in rivers. The
Yamuna river is the most polluted river in the
country between Delhi and Etawah. Other
severely polluted rivers are: the Sabarmati at
Ahmedabad, the Gomti at Lucknow, the Kali, the
Adyar, the Cooum (entire stretches), the Vaigai
at Madurai and the Musi of Hyderabad and the
Ganga at Kanpur and Varanasi. Groundwater
pollution has occurred due to high
concentrations of heavy/toxic metals, fluoride
and nitrates at different parts of the country.
The legislative provisions such as the Water
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974,
and Environment Protection Act 1986 have not
been implemented effectively. The result is that
in 1997, 251 polluting industries were located
2015-16
Water Resources     67
along the rivers and lakes. The Water Cess Act,
1977, meant to reduce pollution has also made
marginal impacts. There is a strong need to
generate public awareness about importance of
water and impacts of water pollution. The public
awareness and action can be very effective in
reducing the pollutants from agricultural
activities, domestic and industrial discharges.
Recycle and Reuse of Water
Another way through which we can improve
fresh water availability is by recycle and reuse.
Use of water of lesser quality such as reclaimed
waste-water would be an attractive option for
industries for cooling and fire fighting to reduce
their water cost. Similarly, in urban areas water
after bathing and washing utensils can be used
for gardening. Water used for washing vehicle
can also be used for gardening. This would
conserve better quality of water for drinking
purposes. Currently, recycling of water is practised
on a limited scale. However, there is enormous
scope for replenishing water through recycling.
Observe the quantity of water used at your home in
various activities and enlist the ways in which the water
can be reused and recycled in various activities.
Class teachers should organise a discussion on recycle
and reuse of water.
Watershed Management

Watershed Management
Watershed management basically refers to
efficient management and conservation of
surface and groundwater resources.  It involves
prevention of runoff and storage and recharge
of groundwater through various methods like
percolation tanks, recharge wells, etc. However,
in broad sense watershed management includes
conservation, regeneration and judicious use of
all resources – natural (like land, water, plants
and animals) and human with in a watershed.
Watershed management aims at bringing about
balance between natural resources on the one
hand and society on the other. The success of
watershed development largely depends upon
community participation.
The Central and State Governments have
initiated many watershed development and
management programmes in the country. Some
of these are being implemented by non-
governmental organisations also. Haryali is a
watershed development project sponsored by
the Central Government which aims at enabling
the rural population to conserve water for
drinking, irrigation, fisheries and afforestation.
The Project is being executed by Gram
Panchayats with people’s participation.
Neeru-Meeru (Water and You) programme
(in Andhra Pradesh) and Arvary Pani Sansad
(in Alwar, Rajasthan) have taken up
constructions of various water-harvesting
structures such as percolation tanks, dug out
ponds (Johad), check dams, etc. through
people’s participation. Tamil Nadu has made
water harvesting structures in the houses
compulsory. No building can be constructed
without making structures for water harvesting.
Watershed development projects in some
areas have been successful in rejuvenating
environment and economy. However, there are
only a few success stories.  In majority of cases,
the programme is still in its nascent stage.  There
is a need to generate awareness regarding
benefits of watershed development and
management among people in the country, and
through this integrated water resource
management approach water availability can be
ensured on sustainable basis.

Rain water harvesting is a method to capture
and store rainwater for various uses. It is also
used to recharge groundwater aquifers. It is a
low cost and eco-friendly technique for
preserving every drop of water by guiding the
rain water to bore well, pits and wells. Rainwater
harvesting  increases water availability, checks
the declining ground water table, improves the
quality of groundwater through dilution of
contaminants like fluoride and nitrates,
prevents soil erosion, and flooding and arrests
salt water intrusion in coastal areas if used to
recharge aquifers.
Rainwater harvesting has been practised
through various methods by different
communities in the country for a long time.

Ralegan Siddhi is a small village in the district of Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra. It has become an
example for watershed development throughout the country.
In 1975, this village was caught in a web of poverty and illicit liquor trade. The transformation took place
when a retired army personnel, settled down in the village and took up the task of watershed development.
He convinced villagers about the importance of family planning and voluntary labour; preventing open
grazing, felling trees, and liquor prohibition.
Voluntary labour was necessary to ensure minimum dependence on the government for financial
aids. “It socialised the costs of the projects.” explained the activist. Even those who were working
outside the village contributed to the development by committing a month’s salary every year.
Work began with the percolation tank constructed in the village. In 1975, the tank could not hold
water. The embankment wall leaked. People voluntarily repaired the embankment. The seven wells
below it swelled with water in summer for the first time in the living memory of the people. The people
reposed their faith in him and his visions.
A youth group called Tarun Mandal was formed. The group worked to ban the dowry system, caste
discrimination and untouchability. Liquor distilling units were removed and prohibition imposed. Open
grazing was completely banned with a new emphasis on stall-feeding. The cultivation of water-intensive
crops like sugarcane was banned. Crops such as pulses, oilseeds and certain cash crops with low
water requirements were encouraged.
All elections to local bodies began to be held
on the basis of consensus. “It made the
community leaders complete representatives
of the people.” A system of Nyay Panchayats
(informal courts) were also set up. Since then,
no case has been referred to the police.
A Rs.22 lakh school building was constructed
using only the resources of the village. No
donations were taken. Money, if needed, was
borrowed and paid back. The villagers took pride
in this self-reliance. A new system of sharing
labour grew out of this infusion of pride and
voluntary spirit. People volunteered to help each other in agricultural operation. Landless labourers also
gained employment. Today the village plans to
buy land for them in adjoining villages.
At present, water is adequate; agriculture is
flourishing, though the use of fertilisers and
pesticides is very high. The prosperity also brings
the question of ability of the present generation
to carry on the work after the leader of the
movement who declared that, “The process of
Ralegan’s evolution to an ideal village will not
stop. With changing times, people tend to evolve
new ways. In future, Ralegan might present a
different model to the country.”

Highlights of India’s National Water Policy, 2002
The National Water Policy 2002 stipulates water allocation priorities broadly in the following order:
drinking water; irrigation, hydro-power, navigation, industrial and other uses. The policy stipulates
progressive new approaches to water management. Key features include:
Irrigation and multi-purpose projects should invariably include drinking water component, wherever
there is no alternative source of drinking water.
Providing drinking water to all human beings and animals should be the first priority.
Measures should be taken to limit and regulate the exploitation of groundwater.
Both surface and groundwater should be regularly monitored for quality. A phased programme
should be undertaken for improving water quality.
The efficiency of utilisation in all the diverse uses of water should be improved.
Awareness of water as a scarce resource should be fostered.
Conservation consciousness should be promoted through education, regulation, incentives and
disincentives.

community dependence on groundwater for
domestic use.  Besides bridging the demand-
supply gap, it can also save energy to pump
groundwater as recharge leads to rise in
groundwater table. These days rainwater
harvesting is being taken up on massive scale
in many states in the country. Urban areas
can specially benefit from rainwater
harvesting as water demand has already
outstripped supply in most of the cities and
towns.
Apart from the above mentioned factors,
the issue desalinisation of water particularly
in coastal areas and brackish water in arid and
semi-arid areas, transfer of water from water
surplus areas to water deficit areas through
inter linking of rivers can be important
remedies for solving water problem in India
(read more about inter linking of rivers).
However, the most important issue from the
point of view of individual users, household
and communities is pricing of water.

MINERAL AND
ENERGY
RESOURCES
India is endowed with a rich variety of mineral
resources due to its varied geological structure.
Bulk of the valuable minerals are products of
pre-palaezoic age (Refer: Chapter 2 of Class XI,
Textbook: “Fundamentals of Physical
Geography” and are mainly associated with
metamorphic and igneous rocks of the
peninsular India. The vast alluvial plain tract
of north India is devoid of minerals of economic
use. The mineral resources provide the country
with the necessary base for industrial
development. In this chapter, we shall discuss
the availability of various types of mineral and
energy resources in the country.
A mineral is a natural substance of organic
or inorganic origin with definite chemical and
physical properties.

On the basis of chemical and physical
properties, minerals may be grouped under two
main categories of metallics and non-metallics
which may further be classified as follows :
Fig. 7.1 : Classification of Minerals
2015-16
As, it is clear from the Fig. 7.1 metallic
minerals are the sources of metals. Iron ore,
copper, gold produce metal and are included
in this category. Metallic minerals are further
divided into ferrous and non-ferrous metallic
minerals. Ferrous, as you know, refers to iron.
All those minerals which have iron content are
ferrous such as iron ore itself and those which
do not have iron content are non-ferrous such
as copper, bauxite, etc.
Non-metallic minerals are either organic
in origin such as fossil fuels also known as mineral
fuels which are derived from the buried animal
and plant life such as coal and petroleum. Other
type of non-metallic minerals are inorganic in
origin such as mica, limestone and graphite, etc.
Minerals have certain characteristics. These
are unevenly distributed over space. There is
inverse relationship in quality and quantity of
minerals i.e. good quality minerals are less in
quantity as compared to low quality minerals.
The third main characteristic is that all minerals
are exhaustible over time. These take long to
develop geologically and they cannot be
replenished immediately at the time of need.
Thus, they have to be conserved and not
misused as they do not have the second crop.

Distribution of Minerals in India
Most of the metallic minerals in India occur in
the peninsular plateau region in the old
crystalline rocks. Over 97 per cent of coal
reserves occur in the valleys of Damodar, Sone,
Mahanadi and Godavari. Petroleum reserves
are located in the sedimentary basins of Assam,
Gujarat and Mumbai High i.e. off-shore region
in the Arabian Sea. New reserves have been
located in the Krishna-Godavari and Kaveri
basins. Most of the major mineral resources
occur to the east of a line linking Mangaluru
and Kanpur.
Minerals are generally concentrated in
three broad belts in India. There may be some
sporadic occurrences here and there in isolated
pockets. These belts are :
The North-Eastern Plateau Region
This belt covers Chhotanagpur (Jharkhand),
Odisha Plateau, West Bengal and parts of
Chhattisgarh. Have you ever thought about the
reason of major iron and steel industry being
located in this region? It has variety of minerals
viz. iron ore coal, manganese, bauxite, mica.
Find out the specific region where these
minerals are being extracted.
The South-Western Plateau Region
This belt extends over Karnataka, Goa and
contiguous Tamil Nadu uplands and Kerala.
This belt is rich in ferrous metals and bauxite.
It also contains high grade iron ore, manganese
and limestone. This belt packs in coal deposits
except Neyveli lignite.
This belt does not have as diversified
mineral deposits as the north-eastern belt.
Kerala has deposits of monazite and thorium,
bauxite clay. Goa has iron ore deposits.
The North-Western Region
This belt extends along Aravali in Rajasthan and
part of Gujarat and minerals are associated with
Dharwar system of rocks. Copper, zinc have
been major minerals. Rajasthan is rich in
building stones i.e. sandstone, granite, marble.
Gypsum and Fuller’s earth deposits are also
extensive. Dolomite and limestone provide raw
materials for cement industry. Gujarat is known

for its petroleum deposits. You may be knowing
that Gujarat and Rajasthan both have rich
sources of salt.
Why and where Dandi March was
organised by Mahatma Gandhi?
The Himalayan belt is another mineral belt
where copper, lead, zinc, cobalt and tungsten
are known to occur. They occur on both the
eastern and western parts. Assam valley has
mineral oil deposits. Besides oil resources are
also found in off-shore-areas near Mumbai
Coast (Mumbai High).
In the following pages you will find the
spatial pattern of some of the important
minerals.
Ferrous Mineral
Ferrous minerals such as iron ore, manganese,
chromite, etc., provide a strong base for the
development of metallurgical industries. Our
country is well-placed in respect of ferrous
minerals both in reserves and production.
Iron Ore
India is endowed with fairly abundant
resources of iron ore. It has the largest reserve
of iron ore in Asia. The two main types of ore
found in our country are haematite and
magnetite. It has great demand in international
market due to its superior quality. The iron ore
mines occur in close proximity to the coal fields
in the north-eastern plateau region of the
country which adds to their advantage.
The total reserves of iron ore in the country
were about 20 billion tonnes in the year 2004-
05. About 95 per cent of total reserves of iron
ore is located in the States of Odisha,
Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Goa,
Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
In Odisha, iron ore occurs in a series of hill
ranges in Sundergarh, Mayurbhanj and Jhar.
The important mines are Gurumahisani,
Sulaipet, Badampahar (Mayurbhaj), Kiruburu
(Kendujhar) and Bonai (Sundergarh). Similar
hill ranges, Jharkhand has some of the oldest
iron ore mines and most of the iron and steel
plants are located around them. Most of the
important mines such as Noamundi and Gua
are located in Poorbi and Pashchimi
Singhbhum districts. This belt further extends
to Durg, Dantewara and Bailadila. Dalli, and
Rajhara in Durg are the important mines of
iron ore in the country. In Karnataka, iron ore
deposits occur in Sandur-Hospet area of
Ballari district, Baba Budan hills and
Kudremukh in Chikkamagaluru district and
parts of Shivamogga, Chitradurg and
Tumakuru districts. The districts of
Chandrapur, Bhandara and Ratnagiri in
Maharashtra, Karimnagar and Warangal
district of Telangana, Kurnool, Cuddapah and
Anantapur districts of Andhra Pradesh, Salem
and Nilgiris districts of Tamil Nadu are other
iron mining regions. Goa has also emerged as
an important producer of iron ore.
Manganese
Manganese is an important raw material for
smelting of iron ore and also used for
manufacturing ferro alloys. Manganese
deposits are found in almost all geological

formations, however, it is mainly associated with
Dharwar system.
Odisha is the leading producer of
Manganese. Major mines in Odisha are located
in the central part of the iron ore belt of India,
particularly in Bonai, Kendujhar, Sundergarh,
Gangpur, Koraput, Kalahandi and Bolangir.
Karnataka is another major producer and
here the mines are located in Dharwar, Ballari,
Belagavi, North Canara, Chikkmagaluru,
Shivamogga, Chitradurg and Tumkur.
Maharashtra is also an important producer of
manganese which is mined in Nagpur,
Bhandara and Ratnagiri districts. The
disadvantage to these mines is that they are
located far from steel plants. The manganese
belt of Madhya Pradesh extends in a belt in
Balaghat-Chhindwara-Nimar-Mandla and
Jhabua districts.
Telangana, Goa, and Jharkhand are other
minor producers of manganese.
Non-Ferrous Minerals
India is poorly endowed with non-ferrous
metallic minerals except bauxite.
Bauxite
Bauxite is the ore which is used in
manufacturing of aluminium. Bauxite is found
mainly in tertiary deposits and is associated
with laterite rocks occurring extensively either
on the plateau or hill ranges of peninsular India
and also in the coastal tracts of the country.
Odisha happens to be the largest producer
of Bauxite. Kalahandi and Sambalpur are the
leading producers. The other two areas which
have been increasing their production are
Bolangir and Koraput. The patlands of
Jharkhand in Lohardaga have rich deposits.
Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra are other major producers.
Bhavanagar, Jamnagar in Gujarat have the major
deposits. Chhattisgarh has bauxite deposits in
Amarkantak plateau while Katni-Jabalpur area
and Balaghat in M.P. have important deposits of
bauxite. Kolaba, Thane, Ratnagiri, Satara, Pune
and Kolhapur in Maharashtra are important
producers. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Goa are
minor producers of bauxite.
Copper
Copper is an indispensable  metal in the
electrical industry for making wires, electric
motors, transformers and generators. It is
alloyable, malleable and ductile. It is also mixed
with gold to provide strength to jewellery.
The Copper deposits mainly occur in
Singhbhum district in Jharkhand, Balaghat
district in Madhya Pradesh and Jhunjhunu and
Alwar districts in Rajasthan.
Minor producers of Copper are Agnigundala
in Guntur District (Andhra Pradesh), Chitradurg
and Hasan districts (Karnataka) and South Arcot
district (Tamil Nadu).
Non-metallic Minerals
Among the non-metallic minerals produced in
India, mica is the important one. The other
minerals extracted for local consumption are
limestone, dolomite and phosphate.
Mica is mainly used in the electrical and
electronic industries. It can be split into very thin
sheets which are tough and flexible. Mica in
India is produced in Jharkhand, Andhra
Pradesh, Telanganga and Rajasthan followed by
Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
In Jharkhand high quality mica is obtained in a
belt extending over a distance of about 150 km,
in length and about 22 km, in width in lower
Hazaribagh plateau. In Andhra Pradesh. Nellore
district produces the best quality mica. In
Rajasthan mica belt extends for about 320 kms
from Jaipur to Bhilwara and around Udaipur.
Mica deposits also occur in Mysore and Hasan
districts of Karanataka, Coimbatore,
Tiruchirapalli, Madurai and Kanniyakumari in
Tamil Nadu, Alleppey in Kerala, Ratnagiri in
Maharashtra, Purulia and Bankura in West
Bengal.
Energy Resources
Mineral fuels are essential for generation of power,
required by agriculture, industry, transport and
other sectors of the economy. Mineral fuels like
coal, petroleum and natural gas (known as fossil
fuels), nuclear energy minerals, are the

They lie in Jharkhand-Bengal coal belt and the
important coal fields in this region are Raniganj,
Jharia, Bokaro, Giridih, Karanpura.
Jharia is the largest coal field followed by
Raniganj.  The other river valleys associated
with coal are Godavari, Mahanadi and Sone.
The most important coal mining centres are
Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh (part of Singrauli
coal field lies in Uttar Pradesh), Korba in
Chhattisgarh, Talcher and Rampur in Odisha,
Chanda–Wardha, Kamptee and Bander in
Maharashtra and Singareni in Telangana and
Pandur in Andhra Pradesh.
conventional sources of energy. These
conventional sources are exhaustible resources.
Coal is a one of the important minerals which
is mainly used in the generation of thermal
power and smelting of iron ore. Coal occurs in
rock sequences mainly of two geological ages,
namely Gondwana and tertiary deposits.
About 80 per cent of the coal deposits in
India is of bituminous type and is of non-coking
grade. The most important Gondwana coal
fields of India are located in Damodar Valley.

Singareni collieries, the country’s premier coal production company, still uses canaries to detect the
presence of deadly carbon monoxide in underground mines. Miners collapse and often die even if
small quantities of the highly poisonous CO are present in the air. Though, miners speak lovingly of
the canaries, the underground experience is not at all pleasant for the birds.  When lowered into
mines with CO presence, the birds show distress symptoms such as ruffling of feathers, pronounced
chirping and loss of life.  These reactions occur even if 0.15 per cent of CO is present in the air.  If the
content is 0.3 per cent the bird shows immediate distress and falls off its perch in two to three
minutes. A cage of birds is a good indicator in air containing more than 0.15 per cent CO, said a coal
miner.
The sophisticated hand held CO detectors introduced by the company can detect CO concentrations
from as low as 10 ppm to as high as 1,000 ppm.  But despite this, the miners trust the birds, who
have saved the lives of several of their predecessors.

Tertiary coals occur in Assam, Arunachal
Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland.  It is extracted
from Darangiri, Cherrapunji, Mewlong and
Langrin (Meghalaya); Makum, Jaipur and Nazira
in upper Assam, Namchik – Namphuk (Arunachal
Pradesh) and Kalakot (Jammu and Kashmir).
Besides, the brown coal or lignite occur in
the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry,
Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir.
Petroleum
Crude petroleum consists of hydrocarbons of
liquid and gaseous states varying in chemical
composition, colour and specific gravity. It is an
essential source of energy for all internal
combustion engines in automobiles, railways and
aircraft. Its numerous by-products are processed
in petrochemical industries such as fertiliser,
synthetic rubber, synthetic fibre, medicines,
vaseline, lubricants, wax, soap and cosmetics.
Petroleum is referred to as liquid gold
because of its scarcity and diversified uses.
Lunej. Mumbai High which lies 160 km off
Mumbai was discovered in 1973 and
production commenced in 1976. Oil and
natural gas have been found in exploratory
wells in Krishna-Godavari and Kaveri basin
on the east coast.
Oil extracted from the wells is crude oil
and contains many impurities. It cannot be
used directly. It needs to be refined. There are
two types of refineries in India: (a) field based
and (b) market based. Digboi is an example
of field based and Barauni is an example of
market based refinery.
There are 21 refineries in India as on
June 2011 (Fig. 7.6). Identify the States in
which these are located.
Natural Gas
The Gas Authority of India Limited was set
up in 1984 as a public sector undertaking to
transport and market natural gas. It is
obtained alongwith oil in all the oil fields but
exclusive reserves have been located along the
eastern coast as well as (Tamil Nadu, Odisha
and Andhra Pradesh), Tripura, Rajasthan and
off-shore wells in Gujarat and Maharashtra.
Crude petroleum occurs in sedimentary
rocks of the tertiary period. Oil  exploration
and production was systematically taken up
after the Oil and Natural Gas Commission was
set up in 1956. Till then, the Digboi in Assam
was the only oil producing region but the
scenario has changed after 1956. In recent
years, new oil deposits have been found at the
extreme western and eastern parts of the
country. In Assam, Digboi, Naharkatiya and
Moran are important oil producing areas. The
major oil fields of Gujarat are Ankaleshwar,
Kalol, Mehsana, Nawagam, Kosamba and
Non-Conventional Energy Sources
Fossil fuel sources, such as coal, petroleum,
natural gas and nuclear energy use
exhaustible raw materials. Sustainable
energy resources are only the renewable
energy sources like solar, wind, hydro-
geothermal and biomass. These energy
sources are more equitably distributed and
environmental friendly. The non-conventional
energy sources will provide more sustained,
eco-friendly cheaper energy after the initial
cost is taken care of.

Nuclear Energy Resources
Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source
in recent times. Important minerals used for the
generation of nuclear energy are uranium and
thorium. Uranium deposits occur in the Dharwar
rocks.  Geographically, uranium ores are known
to occur in several locations along the Singbhum
Copper belt.  It is also found in Udaipur, Alwar
and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan, Durg
district of Chhattisgarh, Bhandara district of
Maharashtra and Kullu district of Himachal
Pradesh. Thorium is mainly obtained from
monazite and ilmenite in the beach sands along
the coast of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. World’s
richest monazite deposits occur in Palakkad
and Kollam districts of Kerala, near
Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and
Mahanadi river delta in Odisha.
Atomic Energy Commission was
established in 1948, progress could be made
only after the establishment of the Atomic
Energy Institute at Trombay in 1954 which was
renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre in 1967. The important nuclear power
projects are Tarapur (Maharashtra),
Rawatbhata near Kota (Rajasthan), Kalpakkam
(Tamil Nadu), Narora (Uttar Pradesh), Kaiga
(Karnataka) and Kakarapara (Gujarat).
Solar Energy
Sun rays tapped in photovoltaic cells can be
converted into energy,  known as solar energy.
The two effective processes considered to be
very effective to tap solar energy are
photovoltaics and solar thermal technology.
Solar thermal technology has some relative
advantages over all other non-renewable
energy sources. It is cost competitive,
environment friendly and easy to construct.
Solar energy is 7 per cent more effective than
coal or oil based plants and 10 per cent more
effective than nuclear plants. It is generally
used more in appliances like heaters, crop
dryers, cookers, etc.  The western part of India
has greater potential for the development of
solar energy in Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Wind Energy
Wind energy is absolutely pollution free,
inexhaustible source of energy.  The mechanism
How are the developed
countries of the world
utilising non-conventional
energy resources? Discuss.
2015-16
Mineral and Energy Resources     83
of energy conversion from blowing wind is
simple. The kinetic energy of wind, through
turbines is converted into electrical energy. The
permanent wind systems such the trade winds,
westerlies and seasonal wind like monsoon have
been used as source of energy.  Besides these,
local winds, land and sea breezes can also be
used to produce electricity.
India, already has started generating wind
energy. It has an ambitious programme to install
250 wind-driven turbines with a total capacity
of 45 megawatts, spread over 12 suitable
locations, specially in coastal areas. The Ministry
of Non-conventional Sources of Energy is
developing wind energy in India to lessen the
burden of oil import bill. The country’s  potential
of wind power generation exceeds 50,000
megawatts, of  which one fourth can be easily
harnessed. In Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra
and Karnataka, favourable conditions for wind
energy exist.
Tidal and Wave Energy
Ocean currents are the store-house of infinite
energy. Since the beginning of seventeenth and
eighteenth century, persistent efforts were made
to create a more efficient energy system from
the ceaseless tidal waves and ocean current.
Large tidal waves are known to occur
along the west coast of India. Hence, India has
great potential for the development of tidal
energy along the coasts but so far these have
not yet been utilised.
Geothermal Energy
When the magma from the interior of earth,
comes out on the surface, tremendous heat is
released. This heat energy can successfully be
tapped and converted to electrical energy. Apart
from this, the hot water that gushes out through
the gyser wells is also used in the generation of
thermal energy. It is popularly known as
Geothermal energy. This energy is now
considered to be one of the key energy sources
which can be developed as an alternate source.
The hot springs and geysers are being used
since medieval period. In India, a geothermal
energy plant has been commissioned at
Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh.
The first successful (1890) attempt to tap
the underground heat was made in the city
of Boise, Idaho (U.S.A.), where a hot water
pipe network was built to give heat to the
surrounding buildings. This plant is still
working.
Bio-energy
Bio-energy refers to energy derived from biological
products which includes agricultural residues,
municipal, industrial and other wastes. Bio-
energy is a potential source of energy conversion.
It can be converted into electrical energy, heat
energy or gas for cooking. It will also process the
waste and garbage and produce energy. This will
improve economic life of rural areas in developing
countries, reduce environmental pollution,
enhance self-reliance and reduce pressure on fuel
wood. One such project converting municipal
waste into energy is Okhla in Delhi.

The challenge of sustainable development
requires integration of quest for economic
development with environmental concerns.
Traditional methods of resource use result into
generating enormous quantity of waste as well
as create other environmental problems. Hence,
for sustainable development calls for the
protection of resources for the future generations.
There is an urgent need to conserve the resources.
The alternative energy sources like solar power,
wind, wave, geothermal energy are inexhaustible
resource. These should be developed to replace
the exhaustible resources. In case of metallic
minerals, use of scrap metals will enable
recycling of metals. Use of scrap is specially
significant in metals like copper, lead and zinc
in which India’s reserves are meagre. Use of
substitutes for scarce metals may also reduce
their consumption. Export of strategic and scarce
minerals must be reduced, so that the existing
reserve may be used for a longer period.

national importance are usually in the public
sector. Industries are also classified on the
basis of the use of their products such as :
(i) basic goods industries, (ii) capital goods
industries (iii) intermediate goods industries,
and (iv) consumer goods industries.
Another method of classifying industries
is on the basis of raw materials used by them.
Accordingly, these can be : (i) agriculture-
based industries, (ii) forest-based industries,
(iii) mineral-based industries, and
(iv) industrially processed raw material-

refineries are also located near the markets as the
transport of crude oil is easier and several
products derived from them are used as raw
material in other industries. Koyali, Mathura and
Barauni refineries are typical examples. Ports also
play a crucial role in the location of oil refineries.
Transport
Have you ever tried to find out the reasons
for the concentration of industries in Mumbai,
Chennai, Delhi and in and around Kolkata?
It was due to the fact that they initially
became the nodal point having transport
links. The industries shifted to interior
locations, only when railway lines were laid.
All major industrial plants are located on the
trunk rail routes.
Labour
Can we think of an industry without labour?
Industries require skilled labour. In India,
labour is quite mobile and is available in large
numbers due to our large population.
Historical Factors
Have you ever thought of the reasons for
emerging Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai as
industrial nodes? These locations were greatly
influenced by our colonial past. During the
initial phase of colonisation, manufacturing
activities received new impetus provided by the
European traders. Places like Murshidabad,
Dhaka, Bhadohi, Surat, Vadodara, Kozhikode,
Coimbatore, Mysuru etc., emerged as important
manufacturing centres. In the subsequent
industrial phase of colonialism, these
manufacturing centres experienced rapid
growth due to competition from the goods
manufactured in Britain and the discriminatory
policies of colonial power.

Can you guess the reasons for the location of
iron and steel industry in eastern and southern
India? Why is there no iron and steel industry
in U.P., Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and
Gujarat?
Location of industries is influenced by
several factors like access to raw materials,
power, market, capital, transport and labour,
etc. Relative significance of these factors varies
with time and place. There is strong relationship
between raw material and type of industry. It
is economical to locate the manufacturing
industries at a place where cost of production
and delivery cost of manufactured goods to
consumers are the least. Transport costs, to a
great extent, depend on the nature of raw
materials and manufactured products. A brief
description of factors influencing the location
of industries are given below:
Raw Materials
Industries using weight-losing raw materials are
located in the regions where raw materials are
located. Why are the sugar mills in India located
in sugarcane growing areas? Similarly, the
locations of pulp industry, copper smelting and
pig iron industries are located near their raw
materials. In iron and steel industries, iron ore
and coal both are weight-losing raw materials.
Therefore, an optimum location for iron and steel
industries should be near raw material sources.
This is why most of the iron and steel industries
are located either near coalfields (Bokaro,
Durgapur, etc.) or near sources of iron ore
(Bhadravati, Bhilai, and Rourkela). Similarly,
industries based on perishable raw materials are
also located close to raw material sources.
Power
Power provides the motive force for machines,
and therefore, its supply has to be ensured
before the location of any industry. However,
certain industries, like aluminium and
synthetic nitrogen manufacturing industries
tend to be located near sources of power
because they are power intensive and require
huge quantum of electricity.

In the last phase of colonialism, the British
promoted few industries in selected areas. This
led to larger spatial coverage by different types
of industries in the country.
Industrial Policy
India, being a democratic country aims at
bringing about economic growth with balanced
regional development.
Establishment of iron and steel industry
in Bhilai and Rourkela were based on decision
to develop backward tribal areas of the
country. At present, government of India
provides lots of incentives to industries locating
in backward areas.

The iron and steel industry is basic to the
industrial development of any country. The
cotton textile Industry is one of our traditional
industries. The sugar Industry is based on local
raw materials which prospered even in the
British period. Besides the more recent
petrochemical Industry and the IT industry will
be discussed in this chapter.
The Iron and Steel Industry
The development of the iron and steel industry
opened the doors to rapid industrial
development in India. Almost all sectors of the
Indian industry depend heavily on the iron
and steel industry for their basic
infrastructure. Can we make tools to be used
in agriculture without iron?
The other raw materials besides iron ore
and coking coal, essential for iron and steel
industry are limestone, dolomite, manganese
and fire clay. All these raw materials are gross
(weight losing), therefore, the best location for
the iron and steel plants is near the source of
raw materials. In India, there is a crescent
shaped region comprising parts of
Chhattisgarh, Northern Odisha, Jharkhand and
western West Bengal, which is extremely rich
in high grade iron ore, good quality coking coal
and other supplementing raw materials.
The Indian iron and steel industry
consists of large integrated steel plants as
well as mini steel mills. It also includes
secondary producers, rolling mills and
ancillary industries.
Integrated Steel Plants
TISCO
The Tata Iron and Steel plant lies very close to
the Mumbai-Kolkata railway line and about
240 km away from Kolkata, which is the nearest
port for the export of steel. The rivers
Subarnarekha and Kharkai provide water to
the plant. The iron ore for the plant is obtained
from Noamundi and Badam Pahar and coal is
brought from Joda mines in Odisha. Coking coal
comes from Jharia and west Bokaro coalfields.
IISCO
The Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) set
up its first factory at Hirapur and later on
another at Kulti. In 1937, the Steel corporation
of Bengal was constituted in association with
IISCO and set up another iron and steel producing
unit at Burnpur (West Bengal). All the three
plants under IISCO are located very close to
Damodar valley coal fields (Raniganj, Jharia, and
Ramgarh). Iron ore comes from Singhbhum in
Jharkhand. Water is obtained from the Barakar
River, a tributary of the Damodar. All the plants
are located along the Kolkata-Asansol railway
line. Unfortunately, steel production from IISCO
fell considerably in 1972-73 and the plants were
taken over by the government.
Visvesvaraiya Iron and Steel Works Ltd. (VISL)
The third integrated steel plant, the Visvesvaraiya
Iron and Steel Works, initially called the Mysore
Iron and Steel Works, is located close to an iron
ore producing area of Kemangundi in the
Bababudan hills. Limestone and manganese are
also locally available. But this region has no coal.
At the beginning, charcoal obtained by burning
wood from nearby forests was used as fuel till
1951. Afterwards, electric furnaces were installed
which use hydroelectricity from the Jog Falls
hydel power project. The Bhadravati river
supplies water to the plant. This plant produces
specialised steels and alloys.

India : People and Economy
After independence, during the Second
Five Year Plan (1956-61), three new integrated
steel plants were set up with foreign
collaboration: Rourkela in Odisha, Bhilai in
Chhattisgarh and Durgapur in West Bengal.
These were public sector plants under
Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL). In 1973, the
Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) was
created to manage these plants.
Rourkela Steel Plant
The Rourkela Steel plant was set up in 1959 in
the Sundargarh district of Odisha in
collaboration with Germany. The plant was
located on the basis of proximity to raw
materials, thus, minimising the cost of
transporting weight losing raw material. This
plant has a unique locational advantage, as it
receives coal from Jharia (Jharkhand) and iron
ore from Sundargarh and Kendujhar. The
Hirakud project supplies power for the electric
furnaces and water is obtained from the Koel
and Sankh rivers.
Bhilai Steel Plant
The Bhilai Steel Plant was established with
Russian collaboration in Durg District of
Chhattisgarh and started production in 1959.
The iron ore comes from Dalli-Rajhara mine
(Fig. 8.6), coal comes from Korba and Kargali
coal fields. The water comes from the
Tanduladam and the power from the Korba
Themal Power Station. This plant also lies on
the Kolkata-Mumbai railway route. The bulk
of the steel produced goes to the Hindustan
Shipyard at Vishakhapatnam.
Durgapur Steel Plant
Durgapur Steel Plant, in West Bengal, was set
up in collaboration with the government of the
United Kingdom and started production in
1962. This plant lies in Raniganj and Jharia
coal belt and gets iron ore from Noamundi (Fig.
8.7). Durgapur lies on the main Kolkata-Delhi
railway route. Hydel power and water is
obtained from the Damodar Valley Corporation
(DVC).
Bokaro Steel Plant
This steel plant was set up in 1964 at Bokaro
with Russian collaboration. This plant was set
up on the principle of transportation cost
minimisation by creating Bokaro-Rourkela
combine. It receives iron ore from the Rourkela
region and the wagons on return take coal to
Rourkela. Other raw materials come to Bokaro
from within a radius of about 350 km. Water
and Hydel power is supplied by the Damodar
Valley Corporation.
Other Steel Plants
New steel plants which were set up in the
Fourth Plan period are away from the main
raw material sources. All the three plants are
located in South India. The Vizag Steel Plant,
in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh is the
first port based plant which started operating
in 1992. Its port location is of advantage.
The Vijaynagar Steel Plant at Hosapete in
Karnataka was developed using indigenous
technology. This uses local iron ore and
limestone. The Salem Steel Plant in Tamil Nadu
was commissioned in 1982.
Fig 8.9 : Production of Finished Steel
Apart from these major steel plants, there
are more than 206 units located in different
parts of the country. Most of these use scrap
iron as their main raw material, and process it
in electric furnaces.

The Cotton Textile Industry
The cotton textile industry is one of the
traditional industries of India. In the ancient
and the medieval times, it used to be only a
cottage industry. India was famous worldwide
for the production of muslin, a very fine variety
of cotton cloth, calicos, chintz and other
different varieties of fine cotton cloth. The
development of this industry in India was due
to several factors. One, it is a tropical country
and cotton is the most comfortable fabric for a
hot and humid climate. Second, large quantity
of cotton was grown in India. Abundant skilled
labour required for this industry was available
in this country. In fact, in some areas the
people were producing cotton textiles for
generations and transferred the skill from one
generation to the other and in the process
perfected their skills.
Initially, the British did not encourage the
development of the indigenous cotton textile
industry. They exported raw cotton to their mills
in Manchester and Liverpool and brought back
the finished products to be sold in India. This
cloth was cheaper because it was produced at
mass scale in factories in U.K. as compared to
the cottage based industries of India.
In 1854, the first modern cotton mill was
established in Mumbai. This city had several
advantages as a cotton textile manufacturing

Handloom Cotton Textile Industry
Spinning yarn in powerloom
centre. It was very close to the cotton producing
areas of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Raw cotton
used to be brought to Mumbai port to be
transported to England. Therefore, cotton was
available in Mumbai city itself. Moreover,
Mumbai even then was the financial centre and
the capital needed to start an industry was
available there. As a large town, providing
employment opportunities attracted labour in
large numbers. Hence, cheap and abundant
labour too was available locally. The machinery
required for a cotton textile mill could be directly

imported from England. Subsequently, two
more mills, the Shahpur Mill and the Calico Mill
were established in Ahmedabad. By 1947, the
number of mills in India went up to 423 but
the scenario changed after partition, and this
industry suffered a major recession. This was
due to the fact that the most of the good quality
cotton growing areas had gone to West Pakistan
and India was left with 409 mills and only 29
per cent of the cotton producing area.
After Independence, this industry
gradually recovered and eventually flourished.
The cotton textile industry in India can be
broadly divided into two sectors, the organised
sector and the unorganised sector. The
decentralised sector includes cloth produced
in handlooms (including Khadi) and
powerlooms. The production of the organised
sector has drastically fallen from 81 per cent in
the mid-twentieth century to only about 6 per
cent in 2000. At present, the powerlooms on
the decentralised sector produce more than the
handloom sector.
Cotton is a “pure” raw material which does
not lose weight in the manufacturing process.
so other factors, like, power to drive the looms,
labour, capital or market may determine the
location of the industry. At present the trend is
to locate the industry at or close to markets, as
it is the market that decides what kind of cloth
is to be produced. Also the market for the
finished products is extremely variable,
therefore, it becomes important to locate the
mills close to the market.
After the first mills were set up in Mumbai
and Ahmedabad in the second half of the
nineteenth century, the cotton textile industry
expanded very rapidly. The number of units
increased dramatically. The Swadeshi
movement gave a major impetus to the industry
as there was a call for boycotting all British
made goods in favour of Indian goods. After
1921, with the development of the railway
network other cotton textile centres expanded
rapidly. In southern India, mills were set up
at Coimbatore, Madurai and Bengaluru. In
central India, Nagpur, Indore, Solapur and
Vadodara became cotton textile centres. Cotton
textile mills were set up at Kanpur based on
local investment. Mills were also set up at
Kolkata due to its port facilities. The
development of hydro-electricity also favoured
the location of the cotton textile mills away from
the cotton producing areas. The rapid
development of this industry in Tamil Nadu is
the result of the abundant availability of hydel
power for the mills. Lower labour costs at
centres like Ujjain, Bharuch, Agra, Hathras,
Coimbatore and Tirunelveli also caused
industries to be located away from cotton
producing areas.
Thus, the cotton textile industry is located
in almost every state in India, where one or more
of the locational factors have been favourable.
The importance of raw materials has given way
to market or to a cheaper local labour force or
it may be the availability of power.
Presently, the major centres of the cotton
textile industry are Ahmedabad, Bhiwandi,
Solapur, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Indore and Ujjain.
All these centres are the traditional centres and
are located close to the cotton producing
regions. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu
are the leading cotton producing states. West
Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Punjab
are the other important cotton textile producers.
(Fig. 8.11)
Tamil Nadu has the largest number of
mills and most of them produce yarn rather
than cloth. Coimbatore has emerged as the
most important centre with nearly half the mills
located there. Chennai, Madurai, Tirunelveli,
Tuticorin, Thanjavur, Ramanathapuram and
Salem are the other important centres. In
Karnataka, the cotton textile industry has
developed in the cotton producing areas in the
north-eastern part of the state. Davangere,
Hubballi, Ballari, Mysuru and Bengaluru are
important centres. The cotton textile industry
is located in the cotton producing Telengana
region, where most of the mills are spinning
mills producing yarn. The important centres
are Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Warangal
in Telangana and Guntur in Andhra Pradesh.
In Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur is the largest
centre. Some of the other important centres are
2015-16
India : People and Economy
Modinagar, Hathras, Saharanpur, Agra and
Lucknow. In West Bengal, the cotton mills are
located in the Hugli region. Howrah,
Serampur, Kolkata and Shyamnagar are the
important centres.
Production of cotton cloth increased almost
five times since independence. Cotton textile has
been facing tough competition from synthetic
cloth. What are the other problems of cotton
textile industry in India?
Sugar Industry
The sugar industry is the second most important
agro-based industry in the country. India is the
largest producer of both sugarcane and cane
sugar and contributes about 8 per cent of the
total sugar production in the world. Besides,
khandasari and gur or jaggery are also prepared
from sugarcane. This industry provides
employment for more than 4 lakh persons
directly and a large number of farmers indirectly.
Sugar industry is a seasonal industry because
of the seasonality of raw materials.
Development of the industry on modern
lines dates back to 1903, when a sugar mill
was started in Bihar. Subsequently, sugar mills
were started in other parts of Bihar and Uttar
Pradesh. In 1950-51, 139 factories were in
operation. The number of sugar factories rose
to 662 in 2010-11.
Location of the Sugar Industry
Sugarcane is a weight-losing crop. The ratio of
sugar to sugarcane varies between 9 to 12 per
cent depending on its variety. Its sucrose
content begins to dry during haulage after it
has been harvested from the field. Better
recovery of sugar is dependent upon its being
crushed within 24 hours of its harvesting.
Sugar factories hence, are located within the
cane producing regions.
Maharashtra has emerged as a leading
sugar producer in the country and produces
more than one-third of the total production of
the sugar in the country.
Uttar Pradesh is the second largest
producer of sugar. The sugar factories are
concentrated in two belts – the Ganga-Yamuna
doab and the tarai region. The major sugar
producing centres in the Ganga -Yamuna doab
are Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut,
Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Bulandshahr
districts; while Kheri Lakhimpur, Basti, Gonda,
Gorakhpur, Bahraich are important sugar
producing districts in the Tarai region.
In Tamil Nadu, sugar factories are located
in Coimbatore, Vellore, Tiruvanamalai,
Villupuram and Tiruchchirappalli districts.
Belagavi, Ballari, Mandya, Shivamogga,
Vijayapura and Chitradurg districts are the
major producers in Karnataka. The industry is
distributed in the coastal regions i.e. East
Godavari, West Godavari, Vishakhapatnam
districts of Andhra Pradesh and Nizamabad and
Medak districts of Telangana.
The other States which produce sugar are
Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and
Gujarat. Saran, Champaran, Muzaffarnagar,
Siwan, Darbhanga, and Gaya are the important
sugarcane producing districts in Bihar. The
relative significance of Punjab has declined,
although Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Sangarur,
Patiala and Amritsar are major sugar
producers. In Haryana, sugar factories are
located in Yamuna Nagar,  Rohtak, Hissar and
Faridabad districts. Sugar industry is
comparatively new in Gujarat. Sugar mills are
located in the cane growing tracts of Surat,
Junagarh, Rajkot, Amreli, Valsad and
Bhavnagar districts.
Petrochemical Industries
This group of industries has been growing very
fast in India. A variety of products come under
this category of industries. In 1960s, demand
for organic chemicals increased so fast that it
became difficult to meet this demand. At that
time, petroleum refining industry expanded
rapidly. Many items are derived from crude
petroleum, which provide raw materials for
many new industries, these are collectively
2015-16
Manufacturing Industries     95
known as petrochemical industries. This group
of industries is divided into four sub-groups:
(i) polymers, (ii) synthetic fibres, (iii) elastomers,
and (iv) surfactant intermediate. Mumbai is the
hub of the petrochemical industries. Cracker
units are also located in Auraiya (Uttar
Pradesh), Jamnagar, Gandhinagar and Hajira
(Gujarat), Nagothane, Ratnagiri (Maharashtra),
Haldia (West Bengal) and Vishakhapatnam
(Andhra Pradesh).
Three organisations are working in the
petrochemical sector under the administrative
control of the Department of Chemicals and
Petrochemicals. First is the Indian Petrochemical
Corporation Limited (IPCL), a public sector
undertaking. It is responsible for the manufacture
and distribution of the various petrochemicals like
polymers, chemicals, fibres and fibre
intermediates. Second is the Petrofils Cooperative
Limited (PCL), a joint venture of the Government
of India and Weaver’s Cooperative Societies. It
produces polyester filament yarn and nylon chips
at its two plants located at Vadodara and Naldhari
in Gujarat. Third is the Central Institute of Plastic
Engineering and Technology (CIPET), involved in
imparting training in petro-chemical industry.
Polymers are made from ethylene and
propylene. These materials are obtained in the
process of refining crude oil. Polymers are used
as raw materials in the plastic industry. Among
polymers, polyethylene is a widely used
thermoplastic. Plastic is first converted into
sheets, powder, resin and pellets, and then used
in manufacturing plastic products. Plastic
products are preferred because of their strength,
flexibility, water and chemical resistance and low
prices. Production of plastic polymers started in
India in the late fifties and the early sixties using
other organic chemicals. The National Organic
Chemicals Industries Limited (NOCIL),
established in private sector in 1961, started the
first naphtha based chemical industry in
Mumbai. Later, several other companies were
formed. The plants located at Mumbai, Barauni,
Mettur, Pimpri and Rishra are the major
producers of plastic materials.
About 75 per cent of these units are in
small scale sector. The industry also uses
recycled plastics, which constitutes about 30
per cent of the total production.
Synthetic fibres are widely used in the
manufacturing of fabrics because of their
inherent strength, durability, washability, and
resistance
shrinkage.
Industries
manufacturing nylon and polyester yarns are
located at Kota, Pimpri, Mumbai, Modinagar,
Pune, Ujjain, Nagpur and Udhna. Acrylic staple
fibre is manufactured at Kota and Vadodara.

Though plastics have become inseparable
items in our daily use and they have affected
our life style. But due to its non-biodegradable
quality it has emerged as the greatest threat to
our environment. Hence, use of plastic is being
discouraged in different states of India. Do you
know how does plastic adversely affect our
environment?

The advancement in information technology has
had a profound influence on the country’s
economy. The Information Technology (IT)
revolution opened up new possibilities of
economic and social transformation. The IT and
IT enabled business process outsourcing (ITES-
BPO) services continue to be on a robust growth
path. Indian software industry has emerged as
one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy.
The software industry has surpassed electronic
hardware production. The Indian government
has created a number of software parks in the
country.
The IT software and services industry
account for almost 2 per cent of India’s GDP.
India’s software industry has achieved a
remarkable distinction for providing quality
products. A large number of Indian software
companies have acquired international quality
certification. A majority of the multinational
companies operating in the area of information
technology have either software development
centres or research development centres in
India. However, in the hardware development
sector, India is yet to make any remarkable
achievements.
A major impact of this growth has been on
employment creation, which is almost doubled
every year.

The new Industrial Policy was announced in
1991. The major objectives of this policy were
to build on the gains already made, correct the
distortions or weaknesses that have crept in,
maintain a sustained growth in productivity
and gainful employment and attain
international competitiveness.
Within this policy, measures initiated are :
(1) abolition of industrial licensing, (2) free entry
to foreign technology, (3) foreign investment
policy, (4) access to capital market, (5) open
trade, (6) abolition of phased manufacturing
programme, and (7) liberalised industrial
location programme. The policy has three main
dimensions: liberalisation, privatisation and
globalisation.
The industrial licensing system has been
abolished for all except six industries related to
security, strategic or environmental concerns. At
the same time, the number of industries reserved
for public sector since 1956 have been reduced
from 17 to 4. Industries related to atomic energy,
substances specified in the Schedule of the
Department of Atomic Energy as well as Railways
have remained under the public sector. The
government also has decided to offer a part of
the shareholdings in the public enterprises to
financial institutions, general public and
workers. The threshold limits of assets have been
scrapped and no industry requires prior
approval for investing in the delicensed sector.
They only need to submit a memorandum in
the prescribed format.
In the new industrial policy, Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) has been seen as a supplement
to the domestic investment for achieving a
higher level of economic development. FDI
benefits the domestic industry as well as the
consumers by providing technological
upgradation, access to global managerial skills
and practices, optimum use of natural and
human resources, etc. Keeping all this in mind,
foreign investment has been liberalised and the
government has permitted access to an
automatic route for Foreign Direct Investment.
The government has also announced changes
in the industrial location policies. Industries are
discouraged in or very close to large cities due
to environmental reasons.
The industrial policy has been liberalised
to attract private investor both domestic and
multi-nationals. New sectors like, mining,
telecommunications, highway construction and
2015-16
Manufacturing Industries     97

2015-16
India : People and Economy
management have been thrown open to private
companies. In spite of all these concessions,
Foreign Direct Investment has not been up to
the expectation. There has been a big gap
between approved and actual foreign direct
investment, even though the numbers of foreign
collaborations are increasing. Larger parts of this
investment have gone to domestic appliances,
finance, services, electronics and electrical
equipment, and food and dairy products.
Globalisation means integrating the
economy of the country with the world
economy. Under this process, goods and
services along with capital, labour and
resources can move freely from one nation to
another. The thrust of globalisation has been
to increase the domestic and external
competition through extensive application of
market mechanism and facilitating dynamic
relationship with the foreign investors and
suppliers of technology. In Indian context, this
implies: (1) opening of the economy to foreign
direct investment by providing facilities to
foreign companies to invest in different fields of
economies activity in India; (2) removing
restrictions and obstacles to the entry of multi-
national companies in India; (3) allowing Indian
companies to enter into foreign collaboration
in India and also encouraging them to set up
joint ventures abroad; (4) carrying out massive
import liberalisation programmes by switching
over from quantitative restrictions to tariffs in
the first place, and then bringing down the level
of import duties considerably; and (5) instead
of a set of export incentives, opting for exchange
rate adjustments for promoting export.
A breakup of foreign collaboration
approval reveals that the major share went to
core, priority sectors while infrastructural sector
was untouched. Further, gap between
developed and developing states has become
wider. Major share of both domestic investment
as well as foreign direct investment went to
already developed states. For example, out of
the total proposed investment by the industrial
entrepreneurs during 1991-2000 nearly one-
fourth (23 per cent) was for industrially
developed Maharashtra, 17 per cent for
Gujarat, 7 per cent for Andhra Pradesh, and
about 6 per cent for Tamil Nadu while Uttar
Pradesh, the state with the largest population
has only 8 per cent. In spite of several
concessions, seven north-eastern states could
get less than 1 per cent of the proposed
investment. In fact, economically weaker states
could not compete with the developed states in
open market in attracting industrial investment
proposals and hence they are likely to suffer
from these processes.

Several indices are used to identify the
clustering of industries, important among them
are : (i) the number of industrial units, (ii)
number of industrial workers, (iii) quantum of
power used for industrial purposes, (iv) total
industrial output, and (v) value added by
manufacturing, etc.
Major industrial regions of the country are
given below in some details (Fig. 8.13).
Mumbai-Pune Industrial Region
It extends from Mumbai-Thane to Pune and
in adjoining districts of Nashik and Solapur.
Besides, industrial development has been
rapid in Kolaba, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli
and Jalgaon districts. Development of this
region started  with the location of cotton
textile industry in Mumbai. Mumbai, with
cotton hinterland and moist climate favoured
the location of cotton textile industry.
Opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 provided
impetus to the growth of Mumbai port.
Machineries were imported through this port.
Hydro-electricity was developed in the
Western Ghat region to meet the requirements
of this industry.
With the development of cotton textile
industry, chemical industry also developed.
Opening of the Mumbai High petroleum field
and erection of nuclear energy plants added
additional pull to this region.
Besides, engineering goods, petroleum
refining, petrochemicals, leather, synthetic
and plastic goods, drugs, fertilisers,
electrical, shipbuilding, electronics, software,
transport equipments and food industries
also developed. Important industrial centres
are Mumbai, Kolaba, Kalyan, Thane,
Trombay, Pune, Pimpri, Nashik, Manmad,
Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Satara and
Sangli.
Hugli Industrial Region
Located along the Hugli river, this region
extends from Bansberia in the north to
Birlanagar in the south for a distance of about
100 km. Industries also have developed in
Mednipur in the west. Kolkata-Haora from the
nucleus of this industrial region. Historical,
geographical, economic and political factors
have contributed much to its development. It
developed with the opening of river port on
Hugli. Kolkata emerged as a leading centre of
the country. Later, Kolkata was connected with
interior parts by railway lines and road routes.
Development of tea plantations in Assam and
northern hills of West Bengal, the processing of
indigo earlier and jute later coupled with the
opening of coalfields of the Damodar Valley and
iron ore deposits of the Chotanagpur plateau,
contributed to the industrial development of the
region. Cheap labour available from thickly
populated part of Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh
and Odisha also contributed to its development.
Kolkata, being the capital city of British India
(1773-1911), attracted the British capital. The
establishment of first jute mill at Rishra in 1855
ushered in the era of modern industrial
clustering in this region.
The major concentration of jute industry
is at Haora and Bhatapara. The partition of the
country in 1947 adversely affected this
industrial region. Cotton textile industry also
grew along with jute industry, paper,
engineering, textile machinery, electrical,
chemical, pharmaceuticals, fertiliser and
petrochemical industries have also developed
within this region. Factory of the Hindustan
Motors Limited at Konnagar and diesel engine
factory at Chittaranjan are landmarks of this
region. Location of petroleum refinery at Haldia
has facilitated the development of a variety of
industries. Important industrial centres of this
region are Kolkata, Haora, Haldia, Serampur,
Rishra, Shibpur, Naihati, Kakinara,
Shamnagar, Titagarh, Sodepur, Budge Budge,
Birlanagar, Bansberia, Belgurriah, Triveni,
Hugli, Belur, etc. However, industrial growth of
this region has slowed down in comparison to
other regions. Decline of the jute industry is one
of the reasons.
Bengaluru-Chennai Industrial Region
This region witnessed most rapid industrial
growth in post-Independence period. Till 1960,
industries were confined to Bengaluru, Salem
and Madurai districts but now they have spread
over all the districts of Tamil Nadu except
Viluppuram. Since, this region is away from the

coalfields, its development is dependent on the
Pykara hydroelectric plant, which was built in
1932. Cotton textile industry was the first to
take roots due to the presence of cotton growing
areas. Along with cotton mills, loom industry
spread very rapidly. Several heavy engineering
industries converged at Bengaluru. Aircraft
(HAL), machine tools, telephone (HTL) and
Bharat Electronics are industrial landmarks of
this region. Important industries are textiles,
rail wagons, diesel engines, radio, light
engineering goods, rubber goods, medicines,
aluminium, sugar, cement, glass, paper,
chemicals, film, cigarette, match box, leather
goods, etc. Petroleum refinery at Chennai, iron
and steel plant at Salem and fertiliser plants
are recent developments.
Gujarat Industrial Region
The nucleus of this region lies between
Ahmedabad and Vadodara but this region
extends upto Valsad and Surat in the south and
to Jamnagar in the west. Development of this
region is also associated with the location of the
cotton textile industry since 1860s. This region
became an important textile region with the
decline of the cotton textile industry at Mumbai.
Located in cotton growing area, this region has
double advantage of the proximity of raw
materials as well as of market. The discovery of
oil fields led to the establishment of petrochemical
industries around Ankleshwar, Vadodara and
Jamnagar. The port at Kandla helped in the rapid
growth of this region. Petroleum refinery at
Koyali provided raw materials to a host of
petrochemical industries. The industrial
structure is now diversified. Besides, textiles
(cotton, silk and synthetic fabrics) and
petrochemical industries, other industries are
heavy and basic chemicals, motor, tractor, diesel
engines, textile machinery, engineering,
pharmaceuticals, dyes, pesticides, sugar, dairy
products and food processing. Recently, largest
petroleum refinery has been set up at Jamnagar.
Important industrial centres of this region are
Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Bharuch, Koyali,
Anand, Khera, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Surat,
Valsad and Jamnagar.
Chotanagpur Region
This  region extends over Jharkhand, northern
Orissa and western West Bengal and is known
for the heavy metallurgical industries. This
region owes its development to the discovery of
coal in the Damodar Valley and metallic and
non-metallic minerals in Jharkhand and
northern Orissa. Proximity of coal, iron ore and
other minerals facilitated the location of heavy
industries in this region. Six large integrated
iron and steel plants at Jamshedpur, Burnpur-
Kulti, Durgapur, Bokaro and Rourkela are
located within this region. To meet the power
requirement, thermal and hydroelectric plants
have been constructed in the Damodar Valley.
Densely populated surrounding regions
provide cheap labour and Hugli region provides
vast market for its industries. Heavy
engineering, machine tools, fertilisers, cement,
paper, locomotives and heavy electricals are some
of the important industries in this region.
Important centres are Ranchi, Dhanbad,
Chaibasa, Sindri, Hazaribag, Jamshedpur,
Bokaro, Rourkela, Durgapur, Asansol and
Dalmianagar.
Vishakhapatnam-Guntur Region
This industrial region extends from
Vishakhapatnam district to Kurnool and
Prakasam districts in the south. Industrial
development of this region hinges upon
Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam ports and
developed agriculture and rich reserves of
minerals in their hinterlands. Coalfields of the
Godavari basin provide energy. Ship building
industry was started at Vishakhapatnam in
1941. Petroleum refinery based on imported
petroleum facilitated the growth of several
petrochemical industries. Sugar, textile, jute,
paper, fertiliser, cement, aluminium and light
engineering are principal industries of this
region. One lead-zinc smelter is functioning in
Guntur district. Iron and steel plant at
Vishakhapatnam uses the Bailadila iron ore.
Vishakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Vijaynagar,
Rajahmundry, Guntur, Eluru and Kurnool are
important industrial centres.

Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut Region
Industries located in this region have shown
very fast growth in the recent past. This region
is located far away from the mineral and power
resources, and therefore, the industries are
light and market-oriented. Electronics, light
engineering and electrical goods are major
industries of this region. Besides, there are
cotton, woollen and synthetic fabrics, hosiery,
sugar, cement, machine tools, tractor, cycle,
agricultural implements, chemical and
vanaspati industries which have developed on
large scale. Software industry is a recent
addition. To the south lies the Agra-Mathura
industrial area which specialises in glass and
leather goods. Mathura with an oil refinery is
a petrochemical complex. Among industrial
centres, mention be made of Gurgaon, Delhi,
Shahdara, Faridabad, Meerut, Modinagar,
Ghaziabad, Ambala, Agra and Mathura.
Kollam-Thiruvananthapuram Region
This industrial region is spread over
Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alwaye,
Ernakulam and Alappuzha districts.
Plantation agriculture and hydropower
provide industrial base to this region. Located
far away from the mineral belt of the country,
agricultural products processing and market
oriented light industries predominate the
region. Among them, cotton textile, sugar,
rubber, matchbox, glass, chemical fertiliser and
fish-based industries are important. Food
processing, paper, coconut coir products,
aluminium and cement industries are also
significant. Location of petroleum refinery at
Kochchi has added a vista of new industries to
this region. Important industrial centres are
Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram, Alluva, Kochchi,
Alappuzha, and Punalur.

PLANNING AND
SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT IN
INDIAN CONTEXT
The word ‘planning’ is not new to you as it is a
part of everyday usage. You must have used it
with reference to preparation for your
examination or visit to a hill station. It involves
the process of thinking, formulation of a scheme
or programme and implementation of a set of
actions to achieve some goal.  Though it is a
very broad term, in this chapter, it has been
used with reference to the process of economic
development. It is, thus different from the
traditional hit-and-miss methods by which

India has centralised planning and the task
of planning in India has been entrusted to
the Planning Commission. It is a statutory
body headed by the Prime Minister and has
a Deputy Chairman and members.  The
planning in the country is largely carried out
through Five Year Plans.
The First Five Year Plan was launched in
1951 and covered the period, 1951-52 to
1955-56. Second and Third Five Year Plans
covered the period from 1956-57 to 1960-61
and 1961-62 to 1965-66 respectively. Two
successive droughts during mid-sixties
(1965-66 and 1966-67) and war with
Pakistan in 1965 forced plan holiday in 1966-
67 and 1968-69. This period was covered
by annual plans, which are also termed as
rolling plans. The Fourth Five Year Plan
began in 1969-70 and ended in 1973-74.
Following this the Fifth Five Year Plan began
in 1974-75 but it was terminated by the then
government one year earlier i.e. in 1977-78.
The Sixth Five Year Plan took off in 1980.
The Seventh Five Year Plan covered the
period between 1985 and 1990. Once again
due to the political instability and initiation
of liberalisation policy, the Eighth Five Year
Plan got delayed.  It covered the period, 1992
to 1997. The Ninth Five Year Plan covered
the period from 1997 to 2002. The Tenth Plan
covered the period from 2002 to 2007. The
Eleventh Plan covered the period from 2007
to 2012. The Twelfth Five Year Plan initiated
in 2012 with a focus on Faster More
inclusive and sustainable growth.
2015-16
reforms and reconstruction are often
undertaken. Generally, there are two
approaches to planning, i.e. sectoral planning
and regional planning.  The sectoral planning
means formulation and implementation of the
sets of schemes or programmes aimed at
development of various sectors of the economy
such as agriculture, irrigation, manufacturing,
power, construction, transport, communication,
social infrastructure and services.
There is no uniform economic development
over space in any country. Some areas are more
developed and some lag behind. This uneven
pattern of development over space necessitates
that the planners have a spatial perspective
and draw the plans to reduce regional
imbalance in development. This type of
planning is termed as regional planning.
Target Area Planning
The planning process has to take special care
of those areas which have remained
economically backward. As you know, the
economic development of a region depends
upon its resource base. But sometimes
resource-rich region also remain backward.
The economic development also requires
technology as well as investment besides the
resource. With the planning experience of
about one and half decades, it was realised
that regional imbalances in economic
development were getting accentuated. In
order to arrest the accentuation of regional and
social disparties, the Planning Commission
introduced the ‘target area’ and target group
approaches to planning. Some of the examples
of programmes directed towards the
development of target areas are Command
Area Development Programme, Drought Prone
Area Development Programme, Desert
Development
Programme,
Development Programme. The Small Farmers
Development Agency (SFDA) and Marginal
Farmers Development Agency (MFDA) which
are the examples of target group programme.
In the 8th Five year Plan special area
programmes were designed to develop
infrastructure in hill areas, north-eastern
states, tribal areas and backward areas.
Hill Area Development Programme
Hill Area Development Programmes were
initiated during Fifth Five Year Plan covering 15
districts comprising all the hilly districts of Uttar
Pradesh (present Uttarakhand), Mikir Hill and
North Cachar hills of Assam, Darjiling district of
West Bengal and Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu.
The National Committee on the Development of
Backward Area in 1981 recommended that all
the hill areas in the country having height above
600 m and not covered under tribal sub-plan
be treated as backward hill areas.
The detailed plans for the development of hill
areas were drawn keeping in view their
topographical, ecological, social and economic
conditions. These programmes aimed at
harnessing the indigenous resources of the hill
areas through development of horticulture,
plantation agriculture, animal husbandry, poultry,
forestry and small-scale and village industry.
Drought Prone Area Programme
This programme was initiated during the
Fourth Five Year Plan with the objectives of
providing employment to the people in
drought-prone areas and creating productive
assets. Initially this programme laid emphasis
on the construction of labour-intensive civil
works. But later on, it emphasised on irrigation
projects, land development programmes,
afforestation, grassland development and
creation of basic rural infrastructure such as
electricity, roads, market, credit and services.
National Committee on Development of
Backward Areas, reviewed the performance of
this programme. It has been observed that this
programme is largely confined to the
development of agriculture and allied sectors
with major focus on restoration of ecological
balance. Since growing population pressure is
forcing the society to utilise the marginal lands
for agriculture, and, thereby causing ecological
degradation, there is a need to create alternative
employment opportunities in the drought-
prone areas. The other strategies of
development of these areas include adoption of
integrated watershed development approach at
the micro-level. The restoration of ecological
balance between water, soil, plants, and human
Planning and Sustainable Development in Indian Context     105

and animal population should be a basic
consideration in the strategy of development of
drought-prone areas.
Planning Commission of India (1967)
identified 67 districts (entire or partly) of the
country prone to drought. Irrigation
Commission (1972) introduced the criterion of
30 per cent irrigated area and demarcated the
drought prone areas.  Broadly, the drought-
prone area in India spread over semi-arid and
arid tract of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Western
Madhya Pradesh, Marathwada region of
Maharashtra, Rayalseema and Telangana
plateaus of Andhra Pradesh, Karantka plateau
and highlands and interior parts of Tamil Nadu.
The drought prone areas of Punjab, Haryana
and north-Rajasthan are largely protected due
to spread of irrigation in these regions.
Case Study – Integrated Tribal Development
Project in Bharmaur* Region
Bharmaur tribal area comprises Bharmaur and
Holi tehsils of Chamba district of Himachal
Pradesh. It is a notified tribal area since
21 November 1975. Bharmaur is inhabited by
‘Gaddi’, a tribal community who have
maintained a distinct identity in the Himalayan
region as they practised transhumance and
conversed through Gaddiali dialect.
This region lies between 32° 11’ N and 32°41’
N latitudes and 76° 22’ E and 76° 53’E
longitudes. Spread over an area of about
1,818 sq km, the region mostly lies between
1,500 m to 3,700 m above the mean sea
level. This region popularly known as the
homeland of Gaddis is surrounded by lofty
mountains on all sides. It has Pir Panjal in
the north and Dhaula Dhar in the south. In
the east, the extension of Dhaula Dhar
converges with Pir Panjal near Rohtang
Pass. The river Ravi and its tributaries– the
Budhil and the Tundahen, drain this territory,
and carve out deep gorges. These rivers
divide the region into four physiographic
divisions called Holi, Khani, Kugti and
Tundah areas.  Bharmaur experiences
freezing weather conditions and snowfall in
winter. Its mean monthly temperature in
January remains 4°C and in July 26°C.
Bharmaur tribal region has harsh climate
conditions, low resource base and fragile
environment. These factors have influenced the
society and Economy of the region. According
to the 2011 census, the total population of
Bharmaur sub-division was 39,113 i.e., 21
persons per sq km. It is one of the most
Fig. 9.1
The name Bharmaur is derived from Sanskrit word Brahmaur. In this book Bharmaur has been used to
retain the colloquial flavour.

(economically and socially) backward areas of
Himachal Pradesh. Historically, the Gaddis
have experienced geographical and political
isolation and socio-economic deprivation. The
economy is largely based on agriculture and
allied activities such as sheep and goat rearing.
The process of development of tribal area
of Bharmaur started in 1970s when Gaddis
were included among ‘scheduled tribes’.  Under
the Fifth Five Year Plan, the tribal sub-plan was
introduced in 1974 and Bharmaur was
designated as one of the five Integrated Tribal
Development Projects (ITDP) in Himachal
Fig. 9.2
2015-16
India : People and Economy
Pradesh. This area development plan was aimed
at improving the quality of life of the Gaddis
and narrowing the gap in the level of
development between Bharmaur and other
areas of Himachal Pradesh.  This plan laid the
highest priority on development of transport
and communications, agriculture and allied
activities, and social and community services.
The most significant contribution of tribal
sub plan in Bharmaur region is the development
of infrastructure in terms of schools, health care
facilities, potable water, roads, communications
and electricity.  But the villages located along the
river Ravi in Holi and Khani areas are the main
beneficiaries of infrastructural development. The
remote villages in Tundah and Kugti areas still
do not have sufficient infrastructure.
The social benefits derived from ITDP
include tremendous increase in literacy rate,
improvement in sex ratio and decline in child
marriage.  The female literacy rate in the region
increased from 1.88 per cent in 1971 to 65 per
cent in 2011.  The difference between males and
females in literacy level i.e. gender inequality,
has also declined. Traditionally, the Gaddis had
subsistence agricultural-cum-pastoral
economy having emphasis on foodgrains and
livestock production. But during the last three
decades of twentieth century, the cultivation of
pulses and other cash crops has increased in
Bharmaur region.  But the crop cultivation is
still done with traditional technology. The
declining importance of pastoralism in the
economy of the region can be gauged from the
fact that at present only about one-tenth of the
total households practise transhumance. But
the Gaddis are still very mobile as a sizeable
section of them migrate to Kangra and
surrounding areas during winter to earn their
livings from wage labour.

Sustainable Development
The term development is generally used to
describe the state of particular societies and the
process of changes experienced by them.
During a fairly large period of human history,
the state of the societies has largely been
determined by the interaction processes
between human societies and their bio-physical
environment. The processes of human-
environment interaction depend upon the level
of technology and institutions nurtured by a
society. While the technology and institutions
have helped in increasing the pace of human-
environment interaction, the momentum thus,
generated in return has accelerated
technological progress and transformation and
creation of institutions.  Hence, development is
a multi-dimensional concept and signifies the
positive, irreversible transformation of the
economy, society and environment.
The concept of development is dynamic and
has evolved during the second half of twentieth
century. In the post World War II era, the concept
of development was synonymous to economic
growth which is measured in terms of temporal
increase in gross national product (GNP) and per
capita income/per capita consumption. But,
even the countries having high economic growth,
experienced speedy rise in poverty because of
its unequal distribution.  So, in 1970s, the
phrases such as redistribution with growth and
growth and equity were incorporated in the
definition of development. While dealing with the
questions related to redistribution and equity,
it was realised that the concept of development
cannot be restricted to the economic sphere
alone. It also includes the issues such as
improving the well-being and living standard of
people, availing of the health, education and
equality of opportunity and ensuring political
and civil rights. By 1980s, development emerged
as a concept encapsulating wide-spread
improvement in social as well as material well-
being of all in a society.
The notion of sustainable development
emerged in the wake of general rise in the
awareness of environmental issues in the late
1960s in Western World. It reflected the concern
of people about undesirable effects of industrial
development on the environment. The
publication of ‘The Population Bomb’ by
Ehrlich in 1968 and ‘The Limits to Growth’
by Meadows and others in 1972 further raised
the level of fear among environmentalists in
particular and people in general. This sets the
scenario for the emergence of new models of
development under a broad phrase
‘sustainable development.’

carried out through two stages. The command
area of Stage-I lies in Ganganagar,
Hanumangarh and northern part of Bikaner
districts.  It has a gently undulating topography
and its culturable command area is 5.53 lakh
hectares. The command area of Stage-II is spread
over Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur,
Nagaur and Churu districts covering culturable
command area of 14.10 lakh ha. It comprises
desert land dotted with shifting sand dunes and
temperature soaring to 50ºC in summers. In the
lift canal, the water is lifted up to make it to flow
against the slope of the land.  All the lift canals
of Indira Gandhi Canal system originate at the
left bank of main canal while all the canals on
the right bank of main canal are flow channels.
Sustainable development takes care of
ecological, social and economic aspects of
development during the present times and
pleads for conservation of resources to enable
the future generations to use these resources.
It takes into account the development of whole
human kind which have common future.
Case Study
Indira Gandhi Canal (Nahar) Command
Indira Gandhi Canal, previously known as the
Rajasthan Canal, is one of the largest canal
systems in India. Conceived by Kanwar Sain in
1948, the canal project was launched on 31
March, 1958.  The canal originates at Harike
barrage in Punjab and runs parallel to Pakistan
border at an average distance of 40 km in Thar
Desert (Marusthali) of Rajasthan.  The total
planned length of the system is 9,060 km
catering to the irrigation needs of a total
culturable command area of 19.63 lakh
hectares. Out of the total command area, about
70 per cent was envisaged to be irrigated by
flow system and the rest by lift system. The
construction work of the canal system has been
Fig. 9.4: Indira Gandhi Canal
Fig. 9.5 : Indira Gandhi Canal and its adjoining areas
Irrigation in Stage-I command area of
the canal was introduced in early 1960s,
whereas, the command area of Stage-II began
receiving irrigation in mid-1980s. The
introduction of canal irrigation in this dry
land has transformed its ecology, economy
and society. It has influenced the
environmental conditions of the region both
positively as well as negatively. The
availability of soil moisture for a longer
period of time and various afforestation and
pasture development programmes under
CAD have resulted in greening the land. This
has also helped in reducing wind erosion and
siltation of canal systems. But the intensive
irrigation and excessive use of water has led
to the emergence of twin environmental
problems of water logging and soil salinity.
Introduction of canal irrigation has
brought about a perceptible transformation
2015-16
Planning and Sustainable Development in Indian Context     111
in the agricultural economy of the region. Soil
moisture has been a limiting factor in
successful growing of crops in this area.
Spread of canal irrigation has led to increase
in cultivated area and intensity of cropping.
The traditional crops sown in the area, gram,
bajra and jowar have been replaced by wheat,
cotton, groundnut and rice. This is the result
of intensive irrigation. This intensive irrigation,
no doubt, initially has led to tremendous
increase in agricultural and livestock
productivity.  This has also caused water logging
and soil salinity, and thus, in the long run, it
hampers the sustainability of agriculture.
Measures for Promotion of Sustainable
Development
The ecological sustainability of Indira Gandhi
Canal Project has been questioned by various
scholars. Their point of view has also largely
been validated by the course of development
this region has taken during the last four
decades, which has resulted in degradation of
physical environment. It is a hard fact that
attaining sustainable development in the
command area requires major thrust upon the
measures to achieve ecological sustainability.
Hence, five of the seven measures proposed to
promote sustainable development in the
command area are meant to restore ecological
balance.
(i) The
first
requirement
strict
implementation of water management
policy.  The canal project envisages
protective irrigation in Stage-I and
extensive irrigation of crops and pasture
development in Stage-II.
(ii) In general, the cropping pattern shall not
include water intensive crops. It shall be
adhered to and people shall be
encouraged to grow plantation crops such
as citrus fruits.
(iii) The CAD programmes such as lining of
water courses, land development and
levelling and warabandi system (equal
distribution of canal water in the
command area of outlet) shall be effectively
implemented to reduce the conveyance
loss of water.
(iv) The areas affected by water logging and
soil salinity shall be reclaimed.
(v) The eco-development through afforestation,
shelterbelt plantation and pasture
development is necessary particularly in
the fragile environment of Stage-II.
(vi) The social sustainability in the region can
be achieved only if the land allottees having
poor economic background are provided
adequate financial and institutional
support for cultivation of land.
(vii) The economic sustainability in the region
cannot be attained only through
development of agriculture and animal
husbandry. The agricultural and allied
activities have to develop alongwith other
sectors of economy. This shall lead to
diversification of economic base and
establishment of functional linkages
between basic villages, agro-service centres
and market centres.

TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATION
We use many items in our daily life. From tooth
paste to our bed tea, milk, clothes, soaps, food
items, etc. are required every day. All these can
be purchased from the market. Have you ever
thought as to how these items are brought from
the site of production? All the production is
meant for consumption. From the fields and
factory, the produce is brought to the place from
where consumers purchase it. It is the
transportation of these items from the site of
their production to the market which make
them available to the consumer.
We not only use material things like fruits,
vegetables, books, clothes, etc. but also use
ideas, views and messages in our daily life. Do
you know we exchange our views, ideas and
messages from one place to another or one
individual to another while communicating with
the help of various means?
The use of transport and communication
depends upon our need to move things from
place of their availability to the place of their
use. Human-beings use various methods to
move goods, commodities, ideas from one place
to another.
The following diagram shows the major
means of transportation.

The pathways and unmetalled roads have been
used for transportation in India since ancient
times. With the economic and technological
development, metalled roads and railways were
developed to move large volume of goods and

people from one place to another. Ropeways,
cableways and pipelines were devised to cater
to the demands of transporting specific goods
under special circumstances.
Road Transport
India has one of the largest road networks in
the world with a total length of 42.3 lakh km
(2008-09). About 85 per cent of passenger and
(1961) was introduced to improve the
conditions of roads in India. However, roads
continue to concentrate in and around urban
centres. Rural and remote areas had the least
connectivity by road.
For the purpose of construction and
maintenance, roads are classified as National
Highways (NH), State Highways(SH), Major
District Roads and Rural Roads.
70 per cent of freight traffic are carried by roads
every year. Road transport is relatively suitable
for shorter distance travel.
Sher Shah Suri built the Shahi (Royal) road
to strengthen and consolidate his empire
from the Indus Valley to the Sonar Valley
in Bengal. This road was renamed the
Grand Trunk (GT) road during the British
period, connecting Calcutta and Peshawar.
At present, it extends from Amritsar to
Kolkata. It is bifurcated into 2 segments :
(a) National Highway(NH)-1 from Delhi to
Amritsar, and (b) NH- 2 from Delhi to Kolkata.
Road transport in modern sense was very
limited in India before World War-II. The first
serious attempt was made in 1943 when
‘Nagpur Plan’ was drawn. This plan could not
be implemented due to lack of coordination
among the princely states and British India.
After Independence, twenty-year road plan
National Highways
The main roads which are constructed and
maintained by the Central Government are
known as the National Highways. These roads
are meant for inter-state transport and
movement of defence men and material in
strategic areas. These also connect the state
capitals, major cities, important ports, railway
junctions, etc. The length of the National
Highways has increased from 19,700 km in
1951 to 70,934 km in 2008-09. The National
Highways constitute only 1.67 per cent of the
total road length but carry 40 per cent of the
road traffic. (Table 10.1)
The National Highways Authority of India
(NHAI) was operationalised in 1995. It is an
autonomous body under the Ministry of
Surface Transport. It is entrusted with the
responsibility of development, maintenance
and operation of National Highways. This is also
the apex body to improve the quality of the roads
designated as National Highways.

NHAI has taken up some major projects in
the  country under different phases :
Golden Quadrilateral : It comprises
construction of 5,846 km long 4/6 lane, high
density traffic corridor, to connect India’s four
big metro cities of Delhi-Mumbai-Chennai-
Kolkata. With the construction of Golden
Quadrilateral, the time- distance and cost
of movement among the mega cities of India
will be considerably minimised.
North-South and East-West Corridors :
North-South corridor aims at connecting
Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir with
Kaniyakumari in Tamil Nadu (including
Kochchi-Salem Spur) with 4,076 km long
road. The East-West Corridor has been planned
to connect Silchar in Assam with the port town
of Porbandar in Gujarat with 3,640 km of
road length.
Rural Roads
These roads are vital for providing links in the
rural areas. About 80 per cent of the total road
length in India are categorised as rural roads.
There is regional variation in the density of rural
road because these are influenced by the nature
of the terrain?
State Highways
These are constructed and maintained by state
governments. They join the state capitals with
district headquarters and other important
towns. These roads are connected to the
National Highways. These constitute 4 per cent
of total road length in the country.
District Roads
These roads are the connecting link between
District Headquarters and the other important
nodes in the district. They account for 14 per
cent of the total road length of the country.
Fig. 10.2 : Road constructed under the Pradhan
Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna
Why are the rural roads’ density very low
in hilly, plateau and forested areas? Why
does the quality of rural roads deteriorate
away from the urban centres?
Other Roads
Other roads include Border Roads and
International Highways. The Border Road
Organisation (BRO) was established in May
1960 for accelerating economic development
and strengthening defence preparedness
through rapid and coordinated improvement
of strategically important roads along the
northern and north-eastern boundary of the

Transport and Communication     117
Apart from the construction and
maintenance of roads in strategically sensitive
areas, the BRO also undertakes snow
clearance in high altitude areas. The
international highways are meant to promote
the harmonious relationship with the
neighbouring countries by providing effective
links with India. (Fig. 10.5 and 10.6)
The distribution of roads is not uniform in
the country. Density of roads (length of roads
per 100 square km of area) varies from only
12.14 km in Jammu and Kashmir to 517.77
km in Kerala with a national average of 142.68
km in 2011. The density of road is high in most
of the northern states and major southern
states. It is low in the Himalayan region, north-
eastern region, Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan. Why does this variation occur?
Nature of terrain and the level of economic
development are the main determinants of
density of roads. Construction of roads is easy
and cheaper in the plain areas while it is difficult
and costly in hilly and plateau areas. Therefore,
not only the density but also the quality of roads
is relatively better in plains as compared to
roads in high altitude areas, rainy and forested
regions.

Rail Transport
Indian railways network is one of the longest in
the world. It facilitates the movement of both
freight and passengers and contributes to the
growth of economy. Mahatma Gandhi said, the
Indian railways “brought people of diverse
cultures together to contribute to India’s
freedom struggle.”
Indian Railway was introduced in 1853,
when a line was constructed from Bombay to
Thane covering a distance of 34 km.
Indian Railways is the largest government
undertaking in the country. The length of Indian
Railways network is 64460 km. as on 31 March
2011. Its very large size puts lots of pressure
on a centralised railway management system.
Thus, in India, the railway system has been

Fig. 10.7 : River navigation in the North-east
On the basis of width of the track of Indian
Railways, three categories have been made:
Broad gauge: The distance between rails in
broad gauge is 1.676  metre. The total length
of broad gauge lines was 55188 km in 2011.
Metre gauge: The distance between rails
is one metre. Its total length was 6809 km
in 2011.
Narrow gauge: The distance between the rails
in this case is 0.762 metre or 0.610 metre.
The total length of narrow guage was 2463 km
in 2011. It is generally confined to hilly areas.
Indian Railways has launched extensive
programme to convert the metre and narrow
gauges to broad gauge. Moreover, steam
engines have been replaced by diesel and
electric engines. This step has increased the
speed as well as the haulage capacity.
The replacement of steam engines run by
coal has also improved the environment of the
stations.
Metro rail has revolutionlised the urban
transport system in Kolkata and Delhi.
replacement of diesel buses by CNG run
vehicles along with introduction of metro is a
welcome step towards controlling the air
pollution in urban centres.
Areas around towns, raw material
producing areas and of plantations and other
commercial crops, hill stations and cantonment
towns were well-connected by railways from the
British colonial era. These were mostly
developed for the exploitation of resources. After
the Independence of the country, railway routes
have been extended to other areas too. The most
significant development has been the
development of Konkan Railway along the
western coast providing a direct link between
Mumbai and Mangaluru.
Railway continues to remain the main means
of transport for the masses. Railway network is
relatively less dense in the hill states, north eastern
states, central parts of India and Rajasthan.
Water Transport
Waterways is an important mode of transport
for both passenger and cargo traffic in India. It
is the cheapest means of transport and is most
suitable for carrying heavy and bulky material.
It is a fuel-efficient and eco-friendly mode of
transport. The water transport is of two types–
(a) inland waterways, and (b) oceanic waterways.
Inland Waterways
It was the chief mode of transport before the
advent of railways. It, however, faced tough
competition from road and railway transport.
Moreover, diversion of river water for irrigation

Karnataka. It is considered an
engineering marvel. It crosses 146
rivers, streams, nearly 2000 bridges and
91 tunnels. Asia’s largest tunnel which
is nearly 6.5 km long, also lies on this
route. The states of Maharashtra, Goa

parts of their courses. India has 14,500 km of
navigable waterways, contributing about 1% to
the country’s transportation. It comprises rivers,
canals, backwaters, creeks, etc. At present,
5,685 km of major rivers are navigable by
mechanised flat bottom vessels.

Inland Waterways Authority has also
identified ten other inland waterways, which
could be upgraded. The backwaters (Kadal) of
Kerala has special significance in Inland
Waterway. Apart from providing cheap means
of transport, they are also  attracting large
number of tourists in Kerala. The famous Nehru
Trophy Boat Race (VALLAMKALI) is also held
in the backwaters.
Oceanic Routes
India has a vast coastline of approximate 7,517
km, including islands. Twelve major and 185
minor ports provide infrastructural support to
these routes. Oceanic routes play an important
role in the transport sector of India’s economy.
Approximately 95 per cent of India’s foreign
trade by volume and 70 per cent by value moves
through ocean routes. Apart from international
trade, these are also used for the purpose of
transportation between the islands and the rest
of the country.
Air Transportation
Air transport  is the fastest means of movement
from one place to the other. It has reduced
distances by minimising the travel time. It is
very essential for a vast  country like India,
where distances are large and the terrain and
climatic conditions are diverse.
Air transport in India made a beginning
in 1911 when airmail operation commenced
over a little distance of 10 km between
Allahabad and Naini. But its real development
took place in post-Independent period. The
Airport Authority of India is responsible for
providing safe, efficient air traffic and
aeronautical communication services in the
Indian Air Space. The authority manages 125
airports.
The air transport in India is managed by
two corporations, Air India and Indian Airlines
after nationalisation. Now many private
companies have also started passenger services.
Air India
Air India provides International Air Services for
both passengers and cargo traffic. It connects
all the continents of the world through its
services.

1951 – Four more companies
joined the services, Bharat
Airways, Himalayan Aviation
Limited, Airways India and Kalinga
Airlines.
1953 – Air transport was
nationalised and  two Corporations,
Air India International  and Indian
Airlines were formed. Now Indian
Airlines is known as ‘Indian’.

carrier, Indian Airlines dropped the word
‘Airlines’ from its name and is known as
‘Indian’ w.e.f. December 8, 2005.  The new
brand name ‘Indian’ now appears on both
sides of the fuselage.  The logo on the
orange tail depicting ‘IA’ has also been
changed.  It has been replaced by a new
logo which is a partly visible blue wheel and
is inspired by the Sun Temple at Konark
(Odisha), symbolising timeless motion,
convergence and divergence. It also
embodies strength as well as trust that has
stood the test of time.
In 2010, domestic movement involved

Pipelines are the most convenient and efficient
mode of transporting liquids and gases over
long distances. Even solids can also be
transported by pipelines after converting them
into slurry. Oil India Limited (OIL) under the
administrative set up of the Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Gas is engaged in the
exploration, production and transportation of
crude oil and natural gas. It was incorporated
in 1959 as a company. Asia’s first cross country
pipeline covering a distance of 1,157 km was
constructed by OIL from Naharkatiya oilfield
in Assam to Barauni refinery in Bihar. It was
further extended up to Kanpur in 1966.
Another extensive network of pipelines has been
constructed in the western region of India of
which Ankleshwar-Koyali, Mumbai High-
Koyali and Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ)
are most important. Recently, a 1256 km long
pipeline connecting Salaya (Gujarat) with
Mathura (U.P.) has been constructed. It supplies
crude oil from Gujarat to Punjab (Jalandhar)
via Mathura. OIL is in the process of
constructing of 660 km long pipeline from
Numaligarh to Siliguri.

Communication Networks
Human beings have evolved different methods
of communication over time. In earlier times,
the messages were delivered by beating the
drum or hollow tree trunks, giving indications
through smoke or fire or with the help of fast
runners. Horses, camels, dogs, birds and other
animals were also used to send messages.
Initially, the means of communication were also
the means of transportation. Invention of post-
office, telegraph, printing press, telephone,
satellite, etc has made the communication much
faster and easier. Development in the field of
science and technology has significantly
contributed in bringing about revolution in the
field of communication.
People

modes
communication to convey the messages. On the
basis of scale and quality, the mode of
communication can be divided into following
categories :
2015-16
Transport and Communication     123
Personal Communication System
Among all the personal communication system
internet is the most effective and advanced one. It
is widely used in urban areas. It enables the user
to establish direct contact through e-mail to get
access to the world of knowledge and information.
It is increasingly used for e-commerce and
carrying out money transactions. The internet is
like a huge central warehouse of data, with
detailed information on various items. The
network through internet and e-mail provides an
efficient access to information at a comparatively
low cost. It enables us with the basic facilities of
direct communication. You might have noticed
the proliferation of cyber cafes in urban areas.
Mass Communication System
Radio
Radio broadcasting started in India in 1923 by
the Radio Club of Bombay. Since then, it gained
immense popularity and changed the socio-
cultural life of people. Within no time, it made a
place in every household of the country.
Government took this opportunity and brought
this popular mode of communication under its
control in 1930 under the Indian Broadcasting
System. It was changed to All India Radio in
1936 and to Akashwani in 1957.
All India Radio broadcasts a variety of
programmes related to information, education
and entertainment. Special news bulletins are
also broadcast at specific occasions like session
of parliament and state legislatures.
Television (T.V.)
Television broadcasting has emerged as the
most effective audio-visual medium for
disseminating information and educating
masses. Initially, the T.V. services were limited
only to the National Capital where it began in
1959. After 1972, several other centres became
operational. In 1976, TV was delinked from All
India Radio (AIR) and got a separate identity
as Doordarshan (DD). After INSAT-IA (National
Television-DD1) became operational, Common
National Programmes (CNP) were started for the
entire network and its services were extended
to the backward and remote rural areas.
Satellite  Communication
Satellites are mode of communication in
themselves as well as they regulate the use of other
means of communication. However, use of satellite
in getting a continuous and synoptic view of
larger area has made satellite communication very
vital for the country due to the economic and
strategic reasons. Satellite images can be used
for the weather forecast, monitoring of natural
calamities, surveillance of border areas, etc.
On the basis of configuration and purposes,
satellite system in India can be grouped into two:
Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) and
Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System (IRS). The
INSAT, which was established in 1983,is a multi-
purpose satellite system for telecommunication,
meteorological observation and for various other
data and programmes.
The IRS satellite system became
operational with the launching of IRS-IA in
March 1988 from Vaikanour in Russia. India
has also developed her own Launching Vehicle
PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle). These
satellites collect data in several spectral bands
and transmit them to the ground stations for
various uses. The National Remote Sensing
Centre (NRSC) at Hyderabad provides facilities
for acquisition of data and its processing. These
are very useful in the management of natural
resources.

INTERNATIONAL
TRADE
You have already studied about the various
aspects of International trade in the book
Fundamentals of Human Geography.
International Trade is mutually beneficial as
no country is self-sufficient. India’s
International trade has undergone a sea change
in recent years in terms of volume, composition
as well as direction. Although India’s
contribution in the world trade is as low as one
per cent of the total volume, yet it plays a
significant role in the world economy.
Let us examine the changing pattern of
India’s International trade. In 1950-51, India’s
external trade was worth Rs.1,214 crore, which
rose to Rs. 22,09,270 crore in 2009-10. Can
you calculate the percentage growth in 2009-10
over 1950-51? There are numerous reasons for
this sharp rise in overseas trade, such as, the
momentum picked up by the manufacturing
sectors, the liberal policies of the government and
the diversification of markets.
The nature of India’s foreign trade has
changed over the years (Table 11.1). Though
there has been an increase in the total volume
of import and export, the value of import
continued to be higher than that of exports.
There has also been an increase in trade deficit
over the last couple of years. This increase in
deficit is attributed to the price rise of crude
petroleum which forms a major component of
India’s import list.

Study the data in table 11.2 and answer the following
questions :
Why is the export of agricultural and allied products
declining continuously after 1997-98?
After attaining a peak in 1999-2000, why has the export
of manufacturing goods started decreasing?
Draw bar diagram to show the trends of exports of all
items given in the table. Use pen/pencil of different
colours.
The decline in traditional items is largely due
to the tough international competition. Amongst
the agricultural products, there is a great decline
in the exports of traditional items such as coffee,
spices, tea, pulses, etc. though an increase has
been registered in floricultural products, fresh
fruits, marine products and sugar, etc.
Manufacturing sector alone accounted for
68.0 per cent of India’s total value of export in
2010-11. Engineering goods have shown a
significant growth in the export list. China and
other East Asian countries are our major
competitors. Gems and jewellery contributes a
larger share of India’s foreign trade.

As has already been mentioned, the
composition of commodities in India’s
international trade has been undergoing a
change over the years. The share of agriculture
and allied products has declined whereas
shares of petroleum and crude products and
other commodities have increased. The shares
of ore minerals and manufactured goods have
largely remained constant over the years from
1997-98 to 2003-04. The increase in the share
of petroleum products is due to a rise in
petroleum prices as well as increase in India’s
refining capacity.

exported in 2010-11 and draw bar diagram.
Changing Patterns of the Composition of
India’s Import
India faced serious food shortage during 1950s
and 1960s. The major item of import at that
time was foodgrain, capital goods, machinery
and equipments. The balance of payment was
2015-16
International Trade     127
adverse as imports were more than export in
spite of all the efforts of import substitution.
After 1970s, foodgrain import was discontinued
due to the success of green revolution but the
energy crisis of 1973 pushed the prices of
petroleum, and import budget was also pushed
up. Foodgrain import was replaced by fertilisers
and petroleum. Machine and equipment,
special steel, edible oil and chemicals largely
make the import basket. Examine the changing
pattern of imports in Table 11.4 and try to
comprehend the shifts.
Table 11.4  shows that there is a steep rise
in imports of petroleum products. It is used not
only as a fuel but also as an industrial raw
material. It indicates the tempo of rising
industrialisation and better standard of living.
Sporadic price rise in the international market
is another reason for the same. Import of capital
goods maintained a steady increase due to rising

demand in the export-oriented industrial and
domestic sectors. Non-electrical machinery,
transport equipment, manufacturers of metals
and machine tools were the main items of
capital goods. Import of food and allied
products declined with a fall in imports of
edible oils. Other major items of India’s import
include pearls and semi precious stones, gold
and silver, metalliferrous ores and metal scrap,
non-ferrous metals, electronic goods, etc. The

Direction of Trade
India  has trade relations with most of the
countries and major trading blocks of the
world.
Region-wise and sub-region-wise trade
during the period 2010-11 has been given in
table 11.6.
India is a success story in terms of
diversification of export and import markets.
The share of Asia and ASEAN in total trade
increased from 33.3 per cent in 2000-01 to 57.3
per cent in the first half of 2011-12, while that
of Europe and America fell from 42.5 per cent
to 30.8 per cent respectively. This has helped
India weather the global crisis emanating from
Europe and America.
(Source : Economic Survey 2011-12)
An interesting development in the direction
of India’s trade is that the USA which was in
first position in 2003-04 has been relegated to
third position in 2010-11, with the UAE
becoming India’s largest trading partner,
followed by China. This position continued from
2008-09 to 2010-11.
Draw a multiple bar diagram to represent the major
trading partners.
Most of India’s foreign trade is carried
through sea and air routes. However, a small
portion is also carried through land route to
neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan,
Bangladesh and Pakistan.

transport provided there is no turbulence. India
traders and colonisation of the country by the
British. This led to the variation in the size and
quality of ports. There are some ports which
have very vast area of influence and some have
limited area of influence. At present, India has
12 major ports and 185 minor or intermediate
ports. In case of the major ports, central
government decides the policy and plays
regulatory functions. The minor ports are there
whose policy and functions are regulated by
state governments. The major ports handle
larger share of the total traffic. The 12 major
ports handled about 71 per cent of the country’s
oceanic traffic in 2008-09.
The British used the ports as suction
points of the resources from their hinterlands.
The extension of railways towards the interior
facilitated the linking of the local markets to
regional markets, regional markets to national
markets and national markets to the
international markets. This trend continued till
1947. It was expected that the country’s
independence will reverse the process, but the
partition of the country snatched away two very
important ports i.e. Karachi port went to
Pakistan and Chittagong port to the erstwhile
east-Pakistan and now Bangladesh. To
compensate the losses, many new ports like the
Kandla in the west and the Diamond Harbour
near Kolkata on river Hugli in the east were
developed.
Despite this major setback, Indian ports
continued to grow after the Independence.
Today Indian ports are handling large volumes
of domestic as well as overseas trade. Most of
the ports are equipped with modern
infrastructure. Previously the development and
modernisation was the responsibility of the
government agencies, but considering the
increase in function and need to bring these
ports at par with the international ports, private
entrepreneurs have been invited for the
modernisation of ports in India.
The capacity of Indian ports increased from
20 million tonnes of cargo handling in 1951 to
more than 586 million tonnes in 2008-09.

many ports with place name suffixed with

ports in India is that its west coast has more
seaports than its east coast.
Can you find out the reasons for the
variations in the location of ports along the
two coasts?
Though ports have been in use since
ancient times, the emergence of ports as
gateways of international trade became
important after the coming of the European

Some of the Indian ports along with their
hinterlands are as follows :
Kandla Port situated at the head of Gulf of
Kuchchh has been developed as a major port to
cater to the needs of western and north western
parts of the country and also to reduce the
pressure at Mumbai port. The port is specially
designed to receive large quantities of petroleum
and petroleum products and fertiliser. The
offshore terminal at Vadinar has been developed
to reduce the pressure at Kandla port.
Demarcation of the boundary of the
hinterland would be difficult as it is not fixed
over space. In most of the cases, hinterland of
one port may overlap with that of the other.
Mumbai is a natural harbour and the
biggest port of the country. The port is situated
closer to the general routes from the countries
of Middle East, Mediterranean countries, North
Africa, North America and Europe where the
major share of country’s overseas trade is
carried out. The port is 20 km long and 6-10
km wide with 54 berths and has the country’s
largest oil terminal. M.P., Maharashtra, Gujarat,
U.P. and parts of Rajasthan constitute the main
hinterlands of Mumbai ports.
Jawaharlal Nehru Port at Nhava Sheva
was developed as a satellite port to relieve the
pressure at the Mumbai port. It is the largest
container port in India.
Marmagao Port, situated at the entrance
of the Zuari estuary, is a natural harbour in
Goa. It gained significance after its remodelling
in 1961 to handle iron-ore exports to Japan.
Construction of Konkan railway has
considerably extended the hinterland of this
port. Karnataka, Goa, Southern Maharashtra
constitute its hinterland.
New Mangalore Port is located in the state
of Karnataka and caters to the needs of the
export of iron-ore and iron-concentrates. It also
handles fertilisers, petroleum products, edible
oils, coffee, tea, wood pulp, yarn, granite stone,
molasses, etc. Karnataka is the major
hinterland for this port.
Kochchi Port, situated at the head of
Vembanad Kayal, popularly known as the
“Queen of the Arabian Sea,” is also a natural
harbour. This port has an advantageous
location being close to the Suez-Colombo route.
It caters to the needs of Kerala, southern-
Karnataka and south western Tamil Nadu.
Kolkata Port is located on the Hugli river,
128 km inland from the Bay of Bengal. Like the
Mumbai port, this port was also developed by
the British. Kolkata had the initial advantage
of being the capital of British India. The port
has lost its significance considerably on account
of the diversion of exports to the other ports
such as Vishakhapatnam, Paradwip and its
satellite port, Haldia.
Kolkata port is also confronted with the
problem of silt accumulation in the Hugli river
which provides a link to the sea. Its hinterland
covers U.P., Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal,
Sikkim and the north-eastern states. Apart from
this, it also extends ports facilities to our
neighbouring land-locked countries such as
Nepal and Bhutan.
Haldia Port is located 105 km
downstream from Kolkata. It has been
constructed to reduce the congestion at Kolkata
port. It handles bulk cargo like iron ore, coal,
petroleum, petroleum products and fertilisers,
jute, jute products, cotton and cotton yarn, etc.
Paradwip Port is situated in the Mahanadi
delta, about 100 km from Cuttack. It has the
deepest harbour specially suited to handle very
large vessels. It has been developed mainly to
handle large-scale export of iron-ore. Orissa,
Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand  are the parts of
its hinterland.
Visakhapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh
is a land-locked harbour, connected to the sea
by a channel cut through solid rock and sand.
An outer harbour has been developed for
handling iron-ore, petroleum and general
cargo. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are the
main hinterland for this port.
Chennai Port is one of the oldest ports on
the eastern coast. It is an artificial harbour built

because of the shallow waters near the coast.
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry are its hinterland.
Ennore, a newly developed port in Tamil
Nadu, has been constructed 25 km north of
Chennai to relieve the pressure at Chennai port.
Tuticorin Port was also developed to
relieve the pressure of Chennai port. It deals
with a variety of cargo including coal, salt, food
grains, edible oils, sugar, chemicals and
petroleum products.
Airports
Air transport plays an important role in the
international trade. It has the advantage of
taking the least time for carriage and handling
high value or perishable goods over long
distances. It is very costly and unsuitable for
carrying heavy and bulky commodities. This
ultimately reduces the participation of this
sector in the international trade as compared
to the oceanic routes.
There were 19 international airports
functioning in the country (February 2013).
They are Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Bengaluru,

Environmental pollution results from ‘the
release of substances and energy from waste
products of human activities. There are many
types of pollution. They are classified on the
basis of medium through which pollutants are
transported and diffused. Pollution can be
classified into (i) air pollution, (ii) water
pollution, (iii) land pollution and (iv) noise
pollution.
Water Pollution
Indiscriminate use of water by increasing
population and industrial expansion has led
degradation of the quality of water considerably.
Surface water available from rivers, canals,
lakes, etc. is never pure. It contains small
quantities of suspended particles, organic and
inorganic substances. When concentration of
these substances increases, the water becomes
polluted, and hence becomes unfit for use. In
such a situation, the self-purifying capacity of
water is unable to purify the water.
Though water pollutants are also created
from natural sources (erosion, landslides,
decay and decomposition of plants and
animals, etc.) pollutants from human sources
are the real causes of concern. Human beings
pollute the water through industrial,
agricultural and cultural activities. Among
these activities, industry is the most significant
contributor.

Table 12.1 : Types and Sources of Pollution
Industries produce several undesirable
products including industrial wastes, polluted
waste water, poisonous gases, chemical
residuals, numerous heavy metals, dust,
smoke, etc. Most of the industrial wastes are
disposed off in running water or lakes.
Consequently, poisonous elements reach the
reservoirs, rivers and other water bodies, which
destroy the bio-system of these waters. Major
water polluting industries are leather, pulp and
paper, textiles and chemicals.

Various types of chemicals used in modern
agriculture such as inorganic fertilisers,
pesticides and herbicides are also pollution
generating components. These chemicals are
washed down to rivers, lakes and tanks. These
chemicals also infiltrate the soil to reach the
ground water. Fertiliser induces an increase in
the nitrate content of surface waters. Cultural
activities such as pilgrimage, religious fairs,
tourism, etc. also cause water pollution. In
India, almost all surface water sources are

contaminated and unfit for human
consumption.
Water pollution is a source of various
water borne diseases. The diseases commonly
caused due to contaminated water are
diarrhoea, intestinal worms, hepatitis, etc. World
Health Organisation shows that about one-
fourth of the communicable diseases in India
are water-borne.
Air Pollution
Air pollution is taken as addition of
contaminants like dust, fumes, gas, fog, odour,
smoke or vapour to the air in substantial
proportion and duration that may be harmful
to flora and fauna and to property. With
increasing use of varieties of fuels as source of
energy, there is a marked increase in emission
of toxic gases into the atmosphere resulting in
the pollution of air. Combustion of fossil fuels,
mining and industries are the main sources of
air pollution. These processes release oxides
of sulphur and nitrogen, hydrocarbons,
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead and
asbestos.
Air pollution causes various diseases
related to respiratory, nervous and circulatory
systems.
Smoky fog over cities called as urban smog
is caused by atmospheric pollution. It proves
very harmful to human health. Air pollution can
also cause acid rains. Rainwater analysis of
urban environment has indicated that pH value
of the first rain after summer is always lower
than the subsequent rains.

Urban areas are generally marked by
overcrowding, congestion, inadequate
facilities to support the fast growing
population and consequent poor sanitary
conditions and foul air. Environmental
pollution by solid wastes has now got
significance because of enormous growth in
the quantity of wastes generated from various
sources. Solid waste refers to a variety of old
and used articles, For example stained small
pieces of metals, broken glasswares, plastic
containers, polythene bags, ashes, floppies,
CDs, etc. dumped at different places. These
discarded materials are also termed as
refuse, garbage and rubbish, etc. and are
disposed of from two sources : (i) household
or domestic establishments, and (ii)
industrial or commercial establishments. The
household wastes is disposed off either on
public lands or on private contractors’ sites,
whereas the solid wastes of industrial units
Noise Pollution
Noise pollution refers to the state of unbearable
and uncomfortable to human beings which is
caused by noise from different sources. This
matter has become a serious concern only in
recent years due to a variety of technological
innovations.
The main sources of noise pollution are
various factories, mechanised construction
and demolition works, automobiles and
aircrafts, etc. There may be added periodical
but polluting noise from sirens, loudspeakers
used in various festivals, programmes
associated with community activities. The level
of steady noise is measured by sound level
expressed in terms of decibels (dB).
Of all these sources, the biggest nuisance
is the noise produced by traffic, because its
intensity and nature depend upon such factors
Fig. 12.2 : Noise monitoring at Panchpatmalai
Bauxite Mine
as the type of aircraft, vehicle, train and the
condition of road as well as that of vehicle (in
case of automobiles). In sea traffic, the noise
pollution is confined to the harbour due to
loading and unloading activities being carried.
Industries cause noise pollution but with
varying intensity depending upon the type of
industry.
Noise pollution is location specific and its
intensity declines with increase in distance from
the source of pollution, i.e. industrial areas,
arteries of transportation, airport, etc. Noise
pollution is hazardous in many metropolitan
and big cities in India.

are collected and disposed off through public
(municipal) facilities at low lying public
grounds (landfill areas). The huge turn out
of ashes and debris from industries, thermal
power houses and building constructions or
demolitions have posed problems of serious
consequences. Solid wastes cause health
hazard through creation of obnoxious smell,
and harbouring of flies and rodents, which
act as carriers of diseases like typhoid,
diphtheria, diarrhoea, malaria and cholera,
etc. These wastes cause frequent nuisance
as and when these are carelessly handled,
spread by wind and splittered through rain
water.
Concentration of industrial units in and
around urban centres gives rise to disposal
of industrial wastes. The dumping of
industrial waste into rivers leads to water
pollution. River pollution from city-based
industries and untreated sewage leads to
serious health problems downstream.
Urban waste disposal is a serious
problem in India. In metropolitan cities like
Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, etc.,

Based on the universal law “Polluter pays”, effort to restore the ecology and safeguard the human health with
people’s participation has taken place in Daurala near Meerut. These efforts are now bearing fruits after a
span of three years when Meerut based NGO had developed a model for ecological restoration. The meeting
of the Daurala Industries officials, NGOs, Government officials and other stakeholders at Meerut has brought
out results. The powerful logics, authentic studies and the pressure of people have brought a new lease of life
to the twelve thousand residents of this village. It was in the year 2003 that the pitiable condition of Dauralaites
drew the attention of the civil society. The groundwater of this village was contaminated with heavy metals.
The reason was that the untreated wastewater of Daurala industries was leaching to the groundwater table.
The NGO conducted a door to door survey of the health status of the residents and came out with a report.
The organisation, the village community and people’s representatives sat together to find out sustainable
solutions to the health problem. The industrialists showed a keen interest towards checking the deteriorating
ecology. The overhead water tank’s capacity in the village was enhanced and a 900m extra pipeline was  laid
to supply potable water to the community. The silted pond of the village was cleaned and recharged by
desilting it. Large quantity of silt was removed paving way to large quantity of water so that it recharged the
aquifers. Rainwater harvesting structures have been constructed at different places which has helped in
diluting the contaminants of the groundwater after the monsoons. 1000 trees have also been planted which
have improved the environment.

to 50 per cent of the waste generated are
left uncollected which accumulate on
streets, in open spaces between houses and
in wastelands leading to serious health
hazards. These wastes should be treated as
resource and utilised for generating energy
and compost. Untreated wastes ferment
slowly and release toxic biogas to the
atmosphere, including methane.

increasing. Due to low opportunities in smaller
and medium cities, the poor people generally
bypass these small cities and directly come to
the mega cities for their livelihood.
A case study given below to have better
understanding of the subject. Read it carefully
and try to comprehend the process of rural
urban migration.

Ramesh has been working in contract as a
welder on construction site in Talcher (coal
region of Orissa) for the last two years. He
moved with the contractor to various places
like Surat, Mumbai, Gandhi Nagar, Bharuch,
Jamnagar and so on. He remits Rs. 20,000 per
year to his father in his native village. The
remittances have been mainly used for daily
consumption, health care, schooling of
children, etc. Part of the money is also used in
agriculture, purchasing of land and building
of houses, etc. The standard of living of
Ramesh’s family improved significantly.
Fifteen years ago, the situation was not the
same. The family was passing through very
At present, 47 per cent of the world’s six billion population lives in cities and more will join them in
near future. This proportion is estimated to go up to 50 per cent by 2008. That will put pressure on
governments to make urban areas better places to live with optimum infrastructure facilities for
desirable quality of life.
By 2050, an estimated two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas, imposing even
more pressure on the space infrastructure and resources of cities, which are manifested in terms of
sanitary, health, crime problems and urban poverty.
Urban population grows as a result of natural increase (when birth rate exceeds death rate), net in-
migration (when people move in than out), and sometimes reclassification of urban areas to encompass
formerly rural population settlements. In India, it is estimated that after 1961 around 60 per cent of the
urban growth has been attributed and 29 per cent of them from rural areas to urban migration.

tough times. Three of his brothers and their
families had to survive on three acres of land.
The family was highly in debt. Ramesh had to
discontinue his studies after ninth standard. He
was further hard pressed when he got married.
Simultaneously, he was also impressed by
some successful out-migrants of his village who
had been working in Ludhiana and supporting
their families in village by sending money and
some consumer goods. Thus, due to abject
poverty in the family and perceived job promises
at Ludhiana, he made a move to Punjab with
his friend. He worked there in a woolen factory
for six months at the rate of only Rs. 20 per day
in 1988. Apart from the crisis of managing his
personal expenditure from this meagre income,
he was also facing difficulty in assimilation to
the new culture and environment. Then he
decided to change his place of work from
Ludhiana to Surat under the guidance of his
friend. He learnt the skills of welding in Surat
and after that he has been moving to different
places with the same contractor. Though the
economic condition of Ramesh‘s family at village
improved, he is bearing the pain of separation
of his near and dear ones. He cannot shift them
with him, as the job is temporary and
transferable.
Comments
In developing countries, poor, semi-illiterate and
the unskilled like Ramesh migrating from rural
areas frequently end up performing menial jobs
at low wages in informal sector in urban areas.
Since wages are very low to support the family
at the place of destination, the spouses are left
behind in rural areas to look after children and
elderly people. Thus, the rural-urban migration
stream is dominated by the males.

Dharavi–Asia’s Largest Slum
“…. Buses merely skirt the periphery. Autorickshaws cannot go
there, Dharavi is part of central Bombay where three wheelers are
banned.
Only one main road traverses the slum, the miscalled ‘ninety-foot
road’, which has been reduced to less than half of that for most of
its length. Some of the side alleys and lanes are so narrow that not
even a bicycle can pass. The whole neighbourhood consists of temporary buildings, two or three
storeyed high with rusty iron stairways to the upper part, where a single room is rented by a whole
family, sometimes accommodating twelve or more people; it is a kind of tropical version of the
industrial dwelling of Victorian London’s East End.
But Dharavi is a keeper of more sombre secrets than the revulsion it inspires in the rich; a revulsion,
moreover, that is, in direct proportion to the role it serves in the creation of the wealth of Bombay. In
this place of shadowless, treeless sunlight, uncollected garbage, stagnant pools of foul water, where
the only non-human creatures are the shining black crows and long grey rats, some of the most
beautiful, valuable and useful articles in India are made. From Dharavi come delicate ceramics and
pottery, exquisite embroidery and zari work, sophisticated leather goods, high-fashion garments,
finely-wrought metalwork, delicate jewellery settings, wood carvings and furniture that would find its
way into the richest houses, both in India and abroad…
Dharavi was an arm of the sea, that was filled by waste, largely produced by the people who have
come to live there: Scheduled Castes  and poor Muslims. It comprises rambling buildings of corrugated
metal, 20 metres high in places, used for the treatment of hides and tanning. There are pleasant
parts, but rotting garbage is everywhere…”

separate cultural, social, political, economic and
technological divide.

were considered the ideal republics by
Mahatma Gandhi, most of the rural areas are
still poor performing primary activities. Here
most of the villages exist as appendix to the core
urban centre forming its hinterland.
This may give an impression that urban
centres exist as undifferentiated homogeneous
entities in opposition to the rural areas. On the
contrary, urban centres in India are more
differentiated in terms of the socio-economic,
politico-cultural and other indicators of
development than any other areas. At the top,
there are farm houses and high income group
localities characterised by well-developed
urban infrastructures like wide roads, street
lights, water and sanitation facilities, lawns,
well-developed green belt, parks, play grounds
and provisions for individual security and right
to privacy. At the other extreme of it are the
“slums”, jhuggi-jhopari” clusters and colonies
of shanty structures. These are inhabited by
those people who were forced to migrate from
the rural areas to these urban centres in search
of livelihood but could not afford proper
housing due to high rent and high costs
of land. They occupy environmentally
incompatible and degraded areas.
Slums are residential areas of the least
choice, dillapidated houses, poor hygienic
conditions, poor ventilation, lack of basic
amenities like drinking water, light and toilet
facilities, etc. These areas are overcrowded
having narrow street pattern prone to serious
hazards from fire. Moreover, most of the slum
population works in low paid, high risk-prone,
unorganised sectors of the urban economy.
Consequently, they are the undernourished,
prone to different types of diseases and illness
and can ill afford to give proper education to
their children. The poverty makes them
vulnerable to drug abuse, alcoholism, crime,
vandalism, escapism, apathy and ultimately
social exclusion.
Why are the children of slum-dwellers
deprived of school education?

Land Degradation
The pressure on agricultural land increases not
only due to the limited availability but also by
deterioration of quality of agricultural land. Soil
erosion, water-logging, salinisation and
alkalinisation of land lead to land degradation.
What happens if land is consistently used
without managing its fertility? Land is degraded
and productivity declines. Land degradation is
generally understood either as a temporary or
a permanent decline in productive capacity of
the land.
Though all degraded land may not be
wasteland, but unchecked process of degradation
may lead to the conversion to wasteland.
There are two processes that induce land
degradation. These are natural and created by
human beings. National Remote Sensing Centre
(NRSC) has classified wastelands by using
remote sensing techniques and it is possible to
categorise these wastelands according to the
processes that have created them. There are a
few types of wastelands such as gullied /ravinous
land, desertic or coastal sands, barren rocky
areas, steep sloping land, and glacial areas,
which are primarily caused by natural agents.
There are other types of degraded lands such as
waterlogged and marshy areas, land affected by

Jhabua district is located in the westernmost
agro-climatic zone in Madhya Pradesh. It is, in
fact, one of the five most backward districts of
the country. It is characterised by high
concentration of tribal population (mostly
Bhils). The people suffer due to poverty which
has been accentuated by the high rate of
resource degradation, both forest and land. The
watershed management programmes funded
by both the ministries of “Rural Development”
and “Agriculture”, Government of India, have
been successfully implemented in Jhabua
district which has gone a long way in preventing
land degradation and improving soil quality.
Watershed Management Programmes
acknowledge the linkage between land, water
and vegetation and attempts to improve
livelihoods of people through natural resource
management and community participation. In
the past five years, the programmes funded by
the Ministry of Rural Development alone
(implemented by Rajiv Gandhi Mission for
Watershed Management) has treated 20 per
cent of the total area under Jhabua district.
The Petlawad block of Jhabua is located in
the northernmost part of the district and
represents an interesting and successful case of
Government-NGO partnership and community
participation in managing watershed
programmes. The Bhils in Petlawad block, for
example, (Sat Rundi hamlet of Karravat village)
through their own efforts, have revitalised large
parts of common property resources. Each
household planted and maintained one tree on
the common property. They also have planted
fodder grass on the pasture land and adopted
social-fencing of these lands for at least two
years. Even after that, they say, there would be
no open grazing on these lands, but stall feeding
of cattle, and they are thus confident that the
pastures they have developed would sustain
their cattle in future.
An interesting aspect of this experience is
that before the community embarked upon the
process of management of the pasture, there
was encroachment on this land by a villager
from an adjoining village. The villagers called
the tehsildar to ascertain the rights of the
common land. The ensuing conflict was tackled
by the villagers by offering to make the defaulter
encroaching on the CPR a member of their user
group and sharing the benefits of greening the
common lands/pastures. (See the section on
CPR in chapter “Land Resources and
Agriculture).
