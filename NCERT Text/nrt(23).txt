The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by
adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive
and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour
in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of
teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for
teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather
than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to
address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and
reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for
child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

This textbook is expected to provide a good understanding of the
environment in which a business operates. A manager has to analyse
the complex, dynamic situations in which a business is placed.
Therefore, content enrichment in the form of business news and
abstracts of articles from business journals and magazines has been
given as inset material (boxes). This will encourage students to be
observant about all business activity and discover what is happening
in business organisations with the expectation that they will update
their knowledge through the use  of libraries, newspapers, business
oriented  TV programmes and the internet. Various types of questions
are given and case problems have been introduced to test the
application of subject knowledge to realistic business situations.

Tata Steel, the biggest steel producer
in the Indian private sector has acquired
Corus, (formerly known as British Steel)
in a deal worth $8.6 billion. This makes
Tata Steel the fifth largest steel
producer in the world. A financial
decision of this magnitude has
significant implicitness for both Tata
Steel and Corus as well as their
employees and shareholders. To
mention some of them:
l Tata Steel will become the fifth
largest producer of steel in the world.
l Tata Steel will raise a debt of over
$ 8 billion to finance the transaction.
The deal will be paid for by Tata Steel
UK, a special purpose vehicle (SPV)
set up for the purpose. This SPV will
get funds from Tata Steel routed
through a Singapore subsidiary.
Another company of the Tata group,
Tata Sons Ltd., will invest $ 1 billion
dollars for preference shares along
with Tata Steel which will invest an
equal amount.
l Tata Steel, the acquirer company, shall
have to arrange about 36,500 crores
of rupees to finance the take-over.
l Tata Steel will have to raise this
amount through debt or equity or a
combination of both. Some amount
may come from internal accruals also.
This financing decision will affect the
capital structure of Tata Steel.
l Tata Steel hopes to increase the
production to 40 million tonnes and
revenue to 32 billion US dollars by
2012.

tangible like machinery, factories,

to running the day-to-day operations
of business, like buying material,
paying bills, salaries, collecting cash
from customers, etc. needed at every
stage in the life of a business entity.
Availability of adequate finance is,

All finance comes at some cost. It is
quite imperative that it needs to be
carefully
managed.
Financial
Management is concerned with optimal
procurement as well as the usage of
finance. For optimal procurement,
different available sources of finance
are identified and compared in terms
of their costs and associated risks.
Similarly, the finance so procured
needs to be invested in a manner that
the returns from the investment exceed
the cost at which procurement has
taken place. Financial Management
aims at reducing the cost of funds
procured, keeping the risk under

In the above case, these decisions
require careful financial planning, an
understanding of the resultant capital
structure and the riskiness and
profitability of the enterprise. All these
have a bearing on shareholders as well
as employees. They require an
understanding of business finance,
major financial decision areas,
financial risk, and working capital
requirements of the business. Finance,
as we all know, is essential for running
a business. Success of business
depends on how well finance is
invested in assets and operations and
how timely and cheaply the finances
are arranged, from outside or from
within the business.

this affect the future of the organisation. These decisions are almost irrevocable
after they have been formalised.

control and achieving effective
deployment of such funds. It also aims
at ensuring availability of enough funds
whenever required as well as avoiding
idle finance. Needless to emphasise, the
future of a business depends a great
deal on the quality of its financial
management.
Importance: The role of financial
management cannot be over-
emphasised, since it has a direct
bearing on the financial health of a
business. The financial statements,
such as Balance Sheet and Profit and
Loss Account, reflect a firm’s financial
position and its financial health.
Almost all items in the financial
statements of a business are affected
directly or indirectly through some
financial management decisions. Some
prominent examples of the aspects
being affected could be as under:
(i) The size and the composition of
fixed assets of the business: For
example, a capital budgeting
decision to invest a sum of Rs. 100
crores in fixed assets would raise
the size of fixed assets block by this
amount.
(ii) The quantum of current assets and
its break-up into cash, inventory and
receivables: With an increase in the
investment in fixed assets, there is
a commensurate increase in the
working capital requirement. The
quantum of current assets is also
influenced
financial
management decisions. In addition,
decisions about credit and
inventory management affect the
amount of debtors and inventory
which in turn affect the total
current assets as well as their
composition.
(iii)The amount of long-term and short-
term funds to be used: Financial
management, among others,
involves decision about the
proportion of long-term and short-
term funds. An organisation
wanting to have more liquid assets
would raise relatively more amount
on a long-term basis. There is a
choice between liquidity and
profitability. The underlying ass-
umption here is that current
liabilities cost less than long term
liabilities.
(iv) Break-up of long-term financing into
debt, equity etc: Of the total long-
term finance, the proportions to be
raised by way of debt and/or equity
is also a financial management
decision. The amounts of debt,
equity share capital, preference
share capital are affected by the
financing decision, which is a part
of financing management.
(v) All items in the Profit and Loss
Account, e.g., Interest, Expense,
Depreciation, etc. : Higher amount
of debt means higher interest
expense in future. Similarly, use
of higher equity may entail higher
payment of dividends. Similarly, an
expansion of business which is a
result of capital budgeting decision
is likely to affect virtually all items
in the profit and loss account of
the business.
It can, thus, be stated that the
financial statements of a business are
2015-16(21/01/2015)
BUSINESS STUDIES
largely determined by financial
management decisions taken earlier.
Similarly, the future financial
statements would depend upon past
as well as current financial decisions.
Thus, the overall financial health of a
business is determined by the quality
of its financial management. Good
financial management aims at
mobilisation of financial resources at
a lower cost and deployment of these
in most lucrative activities.
OBJECTIVES

The primary aim of financial
management
maximise
shareholders’ wealth, which is referred
to as the wealth-maximisation
concept. The market price of a
company’s shares is linked to the three
basic financial decisions which you will
study a little later. This is because a
company funds belong to the
shareholders and the manner in which
they are invested and the return
earned by them determines their
market value and price. It means
maximisation of the market value of
equity shares. The market price of
equity share increases, if the benefit
from a decision exceeds the cost
involved. All financial decisions aim at
ensuring that each decision is efficient
and adds some value. Such value
additions tend to increase the market
price of shares. Therefore, those
financial decisions are taken which will
ultimately prove gainful from the point
of view of the shareholders. The
shareholders gain if the value of shares
in the market increases. Those
decisions which result in decline in the
share price are poor financial
decisions. Thus, we can say, the
objective of financial management is
to maximise the current price of equity
shares of the company or to maximise
the wealth of owners of the company,
that is, the shareholders.
Therefore, when a decision is taken
about investment in a new machine,
the aim of financial management is to
ensure that benefits from the
investment exceed the cost so that
some value addition takes place.
Similarly, when finance is procured,
the aim is to reduce the cost so that
the value addition is even higher.
In fact, in all financial decisions,
major or minor, the ultimate objective
that guides the decision-maker is that
some value addition should take place.
All those avenues of investment,
modes of financing, ways of handling
various components of working capital
must be identified which will
ultimately lead to an increase in the
price of equity share. It can happen
through efficient decision-making.
Decision-making is efficient if, out of
the various available alternatives, the
best is selected.

context, it means the selection of best

function, therefore, is concerned with
three broad decisions which are
explained below:
Investment Decision

A firm’s resources are scarce in
comparison to the uses to which they
can be put. A firm, therefore, has to
choose where to invest these
resources, so that they are able to earn
the highest possible return for their
investors. The investment decision,
therefore, relates to how the firm’s
funds are invested in different assets.
Investment decision can be long-
term or short-term. A long-term
investment decision is also called a
Capital Budgeting decision. It involves
committing the finance on a long-term
basis.
example,
making
investment in a new machine to
replace an existing one or acquiring a
new fixed asset or opening a new
branch, etc. These decisions are very
crucial for any business since they
affect its earning capacity in the long
run. The size of assets, profitability and
competitiveness are all affected by
capital budgeting decisions. Moreover,
these decisions normally involve huge
amounts of investment and are
irreversible except at a huge cost.
Therefore, once made, it is often almost
impossible for a business to wriggle out
of such decisions. Therefore, they need
to be taken with utmost care. These
decisions must be taken by those who
understand them comprehensively. A
bad capital budgeting decision
normally has the capacity to severely
damage the financial fortune of a
business.Short-term
investment
decisions (also called working capital
decisions) are concerned with the
decisions about the levels of cash,
inventory and receivables. These
decisions affect the day-to-day working
of a business. These affect the liquidity
as well as profitability of a business.

selected or rejected. If there is only one
project, its viability in terms of the rate
of return, viz., investment and its
comparability with the industry’s
average is seen. There are certain
factors which affect capital budgeting
decisions.
(a) Cash flows of the project: When a
company takes an investment
decision involving huge amount it
expects to generate some cash
flows over a period. These cash
flows are in the form of a series of
cash receipts and payments over
the life of an investment. The
amount of these cash flows should
be carefully analysed before
considering a capital budgeting
decision.
(b) The rate of return: The most
important criterion is the rate of
return of the project. These
calculations are based on the
expected returns from each
proposal and the assessment of the
risk involved. Suppose, there are
two projects, A and B (with the
same risk involved), with a rate of
return of 10 per cent and 12 per
cent, respectively, then under
normal circumstance, project B
should be selected.
(c) The investment criteria involved:
The decision to invest in a
particular project involves a
number of calculations regarding
the amount of investment, interest
rate, cash flows and rate of return.
There are different techniques to
evaluate investment proposals
which are known as capital
budgeting techniques. These
techniques are applied to each
proposal before selecting a
particular project.
Financing Decision

This decision is about the quantum of
finance to be raised from various
long-term sources. Short-term sources
are studied under the ‘working capital
management’.
It involves identification of various
available sources. The main sources
of funds for a firm are shareholders’
funds and borrowed funds. The
shareholders’ funds refer to the equity
capital and the retained earnings.
Borrowed funds refer to the finance
raised through debentures or other
forms of debt. A firm has to decide
the proportion of funds to be raised
from either sources, based on their
basic characteristics. Interest on
borrowed funds have to be paid
regardless of whether or not a firm
has earned a profit. Likewise, the
borrowed funds have to be repaid
at a fixed time. The risk of default
on payment is known as financial
risk which has to be considered by
a firm likely to have insufficient
shareholders to make these fixed
payments. Shareholders’ funds, on the
other hand, involve no commitment
regarding the payment of returns or
the repayment of capital. A firm,
therefore, needs to have a judicious
mix of both debt and equity in making
financing decisions, which may be
debt, equity, preference share capital,
and retained earnings.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
The cost of each type of finance has
to be estimated. Some sources may be
cheaper than others. For example, debt
is considered to be the cheapest of all
the sources, tax deductibility of interest
makes it still cheaper. Associated risk
is also different for each source, e.g., it
is necessary to pay interest on debt and
redeem the principal amount on
maturity. There is no such compulsion
to pay any dividend on equity shares.
Thus, there is some amount of financial
risk in debt financing. The overall
financial risk depends upon the
proportion of debt in the total capital.
The fund raising exercise also costs
something. This cost is called
floatation cost. It also must be
considered while evaluating different
sources. Financing decision is, thus,

concerned with the decisions about
how much to be raised from which
source. This decision determines the

risk of the enterprise.

The financing decisions are affected by
various factors. Important among
them are as follows:
(a) Cost: The cost of raising funds
through different sources are
different. A prudent financial
manager would normally opt for a
source which is the cheapest.
(b) Risk: The risk associated with each
of the sources is different.
(c) Floatation Costs: Higher the floatation
cost, less attractive the source.
(d) Cash Flow Position of the Company:
A stronger cash flow position may
make debt financing more viable
than funding through equity.
(e) Fixed Operating Costs: If a
business has high fixed operating
costs (e.g., building rent,
Insurance premium, Salaries,
etc.), It must reduce fixed
financing costs. Hence, lower debt
financing is better. Similarly, if
fixed operating cost is less, more
of debt financing may be
preferred.
(f) Control Considerations: Issues of
more equity may lead to dilution
of management’s control over the
business. Debt financing has no
such implication. Companies
afraid of a takeover bid would
prefer debt to equity.

Corporate India has opened its purse strings to shareholders with interim
dividends and bonus shares. At least 60 companies have declared interim dividend
or announced plans to do so in the first three weeks of January. In addition, around
12 companies have announced bonus share issues this month, about three times
more than January 2006.
There are range of things that a company can do for maximising shareholder
value and dividend is the most direct and simple form of it. Ideally companies need
to balance it up between paying cash and building value of the stock for total
shareholder returns.
This trend of dividends and bonuses is in synchronisation with the good profits
being posted by companies. It’s a way of rewarding shareholders.
A number of companies have also announced plans of bonus shares for their
shareholders. Most of the companies who have already declared bonus issues or
announced that they would be taking it up in their next board meeting are small or
mid-sized companies.

(g) State of Capital Market: Health of
the capital market may also affect
the choice of source of fund. During
the period when stock market is
rising, more people invest in equity.
However, depressed capital market
may make issue of equity shares
difficult for any company.

The third important decision that
every financial manager has to take
relates to the distribution of dividend.
Dividend is that portion of profit
which is distributed to shareholders.
The decision involved here is how
much of the profit earned by company
(after paying tax) is to be distributed
to the shareholders and how much of
it should be retained in the business.
While the dividend constitutes the
current income re-investment as
retained earning increases the firm’s
future earning capacity. The extent of
retained earnings also influences the
financing decision of the firm. Since
the firm does not require funds to the
extent of re-invested retained
earnings, the decision regarding
dividend should be taken keeping in
view the overall objective of
maximising shareholder’s wealth.
Factors Affecting Dividend Decision
Factors Affecting Dividend Decision
Factors Affecting Dividend Decision
Factors Affecting Dividend Decision
Factors Affecting Dividend Decision
How much of the profits earned by a
company will be distributed as profit
and how much will be retained in the
business is affected by many factors.
Some of the important factors are
discussed as follows:
(a) Amount of Earnings: Dividends are
paid out of current and past
earning. Therefore, earnings is a
major determinant of the decision
about dividend.
(b) Stability Earnings: Other things
remaining the same, a company
having stable earning is in a better
position to declare higher
dividends. As against this, a
company having unstable earnings
is likely to pay smaller dividend.
(c) Stability of Dividends: Companies
generally follow a policy of
stabilising dividend per share.
The increase in dividends is
generally made when there is
confidence that their earning
potential has gone up and not
just the earnings of the current
year. In other words, dividend per
share is not altered if the change
in earnings is small or seen to be
temporary in nature.
(d) Growth Opportunities: Companies
having good growth opportunities
retain more money out of their
earnings so as to finance the
required investment. The dividend
in growth companies is, therefore,
smaller, than that in the non–
growth companies.
(e) Cash Flow Position: The payment
of dividend involves an outflow of
cash. A company may be earning
profit but may be short on cash.
Availability of enough cash in the

necessary
declaration of dividend.
(f) Shareholders’ Preference: While
declaring dividends, managements
must keep in mind the preferences
of the shareholders in this regard.
If the shareholders in general
desire that at least a certain
amount is paid as dividend, the
companies are likely to declare the
same. There are always some
shareholders who depend upon a
regular income from their
investments.
(g) Taxation Policy: The choice between
the payment of dividend and
retaining the earnings is, to some
extent, affected by the difference
in the tax treatment of dividends
and capital gains. If tax on dividend
is higher, it is better to pay less by
way of dividends. As compared to
this, higher dividends may be
declared if tax rates are relatively
lower. Though the dividends are free
of tax in the hands of shareholders,
a dividend distribution tax is levied
on companies. Thus, under the
present tax policy, shareholders are
likely to prefer higher dividends.
(h) Stock Market Reaction: Investors,
in general, view an increase in
dividend as a good news and stock
prices react positively to it.
Similarly, a decrease in dividend
may have a negative impact on the
share prices in the stock market.
Thus, the possible impact of
dividend policy on the equity share
price is one of the important factors
considered by the management
while taking a decision about it.
Access to Capital Market: Large and
reputed companies generally have
easy access to the capital market
and, therefore, may depend less on
retained earning to finance their
growth. These companies tend to
pay higher dividends than the
smaller companies which have
relatively low access to the market.
Legal
Constraints:
Certain
provisions of the Companies Act
place restrictions on payouts as
dividend. Such provisions must be
adhered to while declaring the
dividend.
(k) Contractual Constraints: While
granting loans to a company,
sometimes the lender may impose
certain restrictions on the payment
of dividends in future. The
companies are required to ensure
that the dividend does not violate
the terms of the loan agreement in
this regard.

Financial planning is essentially the
preparation of a financial blueprint of
an organisation’s future operations.
The objective of financial planning is
to ensure that enough funds are
available at right time. If adequate
funds are not available the firm will
not be able to honour its commitments
and carry out its plans. On the other
hand, if excess funds are available, it
will unnecessarily add to the cost and

may encourage wasteful expenditure.
It must be kept in mind that financial
planning is not equivalent to, or a
substitute for, financial management.
Financial management aims at
choosing the best investment and
financing alternatives by focusing on
their costs and benefits. Its objective
is to increase the shareholders’ wealth.
Financial planning on the other hand
aims at smooth operations by focusing
on fund requirements and their
availability in the light of financial
decisions. For example, if a capital
budgeting decisions is taken, the
operations are likely to be at a higher
scale. The amount of expenses and
revenues are likely to increase.
Financial planning process tries to
forecast all the items which are likely
to undergo changes. It enables the
management to foresee the fund

well as the timing. Likely shortage and

Over the next few years, companies cannot afford to ignore dividends. Investors are
looking for higher payouts and need the assurance of a stated dividend policy.
In India, though, there are few companies that are as consistent in dividend
payments, even over the past five years.
The dividend yield, though, has steadily declined and is now at an average of 1.1
per cent for a set of 800 companies. These companies form part of the various BSE
and NSE indices. Not only has the dividend yield gone down, there is not one company
in this list that has increased dividends in line with profit growth in each of the past
five years.
Among companies in the set, those that have steadily increased the payout over
the years include a number of multinational companies that also earn a high return
on net worth. Companies such as Astrazeneca Pharma, Nestle India, Hindustan
Lever, Clariant, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer and Cummins India have
enhanced dividends to deliver value to shareholders. These companies do not seem
to be constrained for growth, either. Some Indian companies that have also shown
the way forward include Automotive Axles, Ranbaxy Labs, Hero Honda Motors,
Asian Paints, Thermax and a number of banking and non-banking finance
companies. These companies, too, are growing fast, and the declaration of dividends
has not dampened prospects.
Companies that have held on to profits and not declared dividends include e-
Serve, Cranes Software, Sesa Goa, Tata Motors, Moser Baer, ABB, MICO, Aztec
Software, Havells India, Amtek India and Sterlite Industries. This is only an indicative
list and includes many more. The dividend payout ratio in the case of the indicated
companies is less than 20 per cent. Investors, however, need dividends to rise and
they also need a stated dividend policy. The earnings yield (inverse of PE ratio) is
now at about 6 per cent. If the payout ratio were stepped up to 40 per cent then the
dividend yield would rise to about 2.5 per cent.

surpluses are forecast so that
necessary activities are taken in
advance to meet those situations.
Thus, financial planning strives to
achieve the following twin objectives.
(a) To ensure availability of funds
whenever required: This include a
proper estimation of the funds
required for different purposes
such as for the purchase of long-
term assets or to meet day-to-day
expenses of business etc. Apart
from this, there is a need to
estimate the time at which these
funds are to be made available.
Financial planning also tries to
specify possible sources of these
funds.
(b) To see that the firm does not raise
resources unnecessarily: Excess
funding is almost as bad as
inadequate funding. Even if there
is some surplus money, good
financial planning would put it to
the best possible use so that the
financial resources are not left
idle and don’t unnecessarily add
to the cost.
Thus, a proper matching of funds
requirements and their availability is
sought to be achieved by financial
planning. This process of estimating
the fund requirement of a business
and specifying the sources of funds is
called financial planning. Financial
planning takes into consideration the
growth, performance, investments and
requirement of funds for a given
period. Financial planning includes
both short-term as well as long-term
planning. Long-term planning relates
to long term growth and investment.
It focuses on capital expenditure
programmes. Short-term planning
covers short-term financial plan called
budget.
Typically, financial planning is
done for three to five years. For longer
periods it becomes more difficult and
less useful. Plans made for periods of
one year or less are termed as budgets.
Budgets are example of financial
planning exercise in greater details.
They include detailed plan of action
for a period of one year or less.
Financial planning usually begins
with the preparation of a sales
forecast. Let us suppose a company is
making a financial plan for the next
five years. It will start with an estimate
of the sales which are likely to happen
in the next five years. Based on these,
the financial statements are prepared
keeping in mind the requirement of
funds for investment in the fixed
capital and working capital. Then the
expected profits during the period are
estimated so that an idea can be made
of how much of the fund requirements
can be met internally i.e., through
retained earnings (after dividend
payouts). This results in an estimation
of the requirement for external funds.
Further, the sources from which the
external funds requirement can be met
are identified and cash budgets are
made, incorporating these factors.

Financial planning is an important part
of overall planning of any business

importance of financial planning can
be explained as follows:
(i) It helps in forecasting what may
happen in future under different
business situations. By doing so,
it helps the firms to face the
eventual situation in a better way.
In other words, it makes the firm

Even successful businesses have debt, but how much is too much? Learning how
to manage debt is what can put you ahead.
Taking on the right amount of debt can mean the difference between a business
struggling to survive and one that can respond nimbly to changing economic or
market conditions. A number of circumstances may justify acquiring debt. As a
general rule, borrowing makes the most sense when you need to bolster cash flow
or finance growth or expansion. But while debt can provide the leverage you need to
grow, too much debt can strangle your business. So the question is: How much
debt is too much?
The answer, experts say, lies in a careful analysis of your cash flow as well as
your industry. A business that doesn’t grow dies. You’ve got to grow, but you’ve got
to grow within the financial constraints of your business. What is the ideal capital

Although banks and other financial institutions look for a satisfactory debt-to-
equity ratio before agreeing to make a loan, don’t assume a creditor’s willingness to
extend funds is evidence that your business is in a strong debt position. Some financial
institutions are overzealous lenders, particularly when trying to lure or hold on to
promising business customers. “The bank may be looking more at collateral than
whether the (business’s) earnings are going to come in to justify the debt service.
To avoid these and other credit pitfalls, it’s up to you to get the financial facts
on your business and make sound borrowing decisions. Unfortunately, many
entrepreneurs fail to recognise how important financial analysis is to running a
successful business. Even business owners who receive detailed financial statements
from their accountants often do not take advantage of the valuable information
contained in the documents.

One of the important decisions under
financial management relates to the
financing pattern or the proportion of
the use of different sources in raising
funds. On the basis of ownership, the
sources of business finance can be
broadly classified into two categories
viz., ‘owners’ funds’ and ‘borrowed
funds’. Owners’ funds consist of equity
share capital, preference share capital
and reserves and surpluses or retained
earnings. Borrowed funds can be in the
form of loans, debentures, public
deposits etc. These may be borrowed
from banks, other financial institutions,
debentureholders and public.
Capital structure refers to the mix
between owners and borrowed funds.
These shall be referred as equity and
debt in the subsequent text. It can be
calculated as debt-equity ratio
i.e.,
Equity
 or as the proportion of
debt out of the total capital i.e.,
Debt+ Equity
Debt and equity differ significantly
in their cost and riskiness for the firm.
The cost of debt is lower than the cost of
equity for a firm because the lender’s risk
is lower than the equity shareholder’s
risk, since the lender earns an assured
return and repayment of capital and,
therefore, they should require a lower
rate of return. Additionally, interest paid
on debt is a deductible expense for
computation of tax liability whereas
dividends are paid out of after-tax
profit. Increased use of debt, therefore,
is likely to lower the over-all cost of
capital of the firm provided that the cost
of equity remains unaffected. Impact
of a change in the debt-equity ratio
upon the earning per share is dealt with
in detail later in this chapter.
Debt is cheaper but is more risky
for a business because the payment of
interest and the return of principal is

obligatory for the business. Any default
in meeting these commitments may
force the business to go into liquidation.
There is no such compulsion in case of
equity, which is therefore, considered
riskless for the business. Higher use of
debt increases the fixed financial
charges of a business. As a result,
increased use of debt increases the
financial risk of a company.
Financial risk is the chance that a
firm would fail to meet its payment
obligations.
Capital structure of a company,
thus, affects both the profitability
and the financial risk. A capital
structure will be said to be optimal
when the proportion of debt and
equity is such that it results in an
increase in the value of the equity
share. In other words, all decisions
relating to capital structure should
emphasise on increasing the
shareholders’ wealth.
The proportion of debt in the
overall capital is also called financial

leverage. Financial leverage is
computed as
E  or
D + E  when D is
the Debt and E is the Equity. As the
financial leverage increases, the cost
of funds declines because of
increased use of cheaper debt but the
financial risk increases. The impact
of financial leverage on the
profitability of a business can be seen
through EBIT-EPS (Earning before
Interest and Taxes-Earning per
Share) analysis as in the following
example.
Three situations are considered.
There is no debt in situation-I i.e.
(unlevered business). Debt of Rs. 10
lakh and 20 lakh are assumed in
situations-II and III, respectively. All
debt is at 10% p.a.
The company earns Rs. 0.93 per
share if it is unlevered. With debt of Rs.
10 lakh its EPS is Rs. 1.05. With a still
higher debt of Rs. 20 lakh, its, EPS rises
to Rs. 1.40. Why is the EPS rising with
higher debt? It is because the cost of
debt is lower than the return that
company is earning on funds employed.
The company is earning a return on
investment (RoI)
of 13.33%

the 10% interest it is paying on debt
funds. With higher use of debt, this
difference between RoI and cost of debt
increases the EPS. This is a situation
of favourable financial leverage. In such
cases, companies often employ more of
cheaper debt to enhance the EPS. Such
practice is called Trading on Equity.
Trading on Equity refers to the
increase in profit earned by the equity
shareholders due to the presence of
fixed financial charges like interest.

In this example, the EPS of the
company is falling with increased use
of debt. It is because the Company’s rate
of return on investment (RoI) is less than
the cost of debt. The RoI for company Y

× 100, i.e., 6.67%, whereas
the interest rate on debt is 10%. In such
cases, the use of debt reduces the EPS.
This is a situation of unfavourable
financial leverage. Trading on Equity is
clearly unadvisable in such a situation.
Even in case of Company X,
reckless use of Trading on Equity is
not recommended. An increase in debt
may enhance the EPS but as pointed
out earlier, it also raises the financial
risk. Ideally, a company must choose
that risk-return combination which
maximises shareholders’ wealth. The
debt-equity mix that achieves it, is the
optimum capital structure.

Deciding about the capital structure
of a firm involves determining the
relative proportion of various types of
funds. This depends on various
factors. For example, debt requires
regular servicing. Interest payment
and repayment of principal are
obligatory on a business. In addition
a company planning to raise debt must
have sufficient cash to meet the
increased outflows because of higher
debt. Similarly, important factors
which determine the choice of capital
structure are as follows:
1. Cash Flow Position:

in mind that a company has cash
payment obligations for (i) normal
business operations; (ii) for investment
in fixed assets; and (iii) for meeting the
debt service commitments i.e., payment
of interest and repayment of principal.

Nevertheless, in spite of the relative lack of ownership, the majority of listed
entities, mostly private sector companies, were managed by these founders, their
successive family members and other promoters as if they were fiefdoms.
By and large, Indian companies were essentially financed by debt. This was
unlike in the West. If the total debt plus nominal equity capital in the average.
Indian company was 100, then 67 per cent of that amount came in the form of debt
capital while equity capital contributed only 33 per cent.
If the share of government ownership in corporate equity and the share of
financial institutions’ equity was added, then over 60 per cent (26.69 + 19.89 +
5.49 + 8.44) of firms’ finances were funded by the state in one form or another.
Foreign shareholders, in spite of a lot a clamour about their role in India’s
corporate economy, hardly owned more than 4 per cent (3.54) of the shares in
India’s listed companies. While the public at large provided about 11 per cent of the
finances of an average Indian listed company, the share of the Top 50 shareholders
was less than 2 (1.85) per cent.
It is within this particular shareholding category that promoters, entrepreneurs and
the other large shareholders’ equity stakes fall under for the purposes of classification.
The public at large provides five times as much money for the company as the
entrepreneurs. Yet, a group of individuals, whose financial contributions towards a
company are exceedingly small in magnitude, effectively control the company.

4. Return on Investment (RoI): If the
RoI of the company is higher, it can
choose to use trading on equity to
increase its EPS, i.e., its ability to use
debt is greater. We have already
observed in Example I that a firm can
use more debt to increase its EPS.
However, in Example II, use of higher
debt is reducing the EPS. It is because
the firm is earning an RoI of only
6.67% which lower than its cost of
debt. In example I the RoI is 13.33%,
and trading on equity is profitable. It
shows that, RoI is an important
determinant of the company’s ability
to use Trading on equity and thus the
capital structure.

Since the tax rate is 30%, the after tax

expect a rate of return from the equity
which is commensurate with the risk
they are assuming. When a company
increases debt, the financial risk faced
by the equity holders, increases.
Consequently, their desired rate of
return may increase. It is for this
reason that a company can not use
debt beyond a point. If debt is used
beyond that point, cost of equity may
go up sharply and share price may
decrease inspite of increased EPS.
Consequently, for maximisation of
shareholders’ wealth, debt can be used
only upto a level.

risk refers to a position when a
company is unable to meet its fixed
financial charges namely interest
payment, preference dividend and
repayment obligations. Apart from the
financial risk, every business has some
operating risk (also called business
risk). Business risk depends upon
fixed operating costs. Higher fixed
operating costs result in higher
business risk and vice-versa. The total
risk depends upon both the business
risk and the financial risk. If a firm’s

required to be made in fixed assets and

which remains in the business for
more than one year, usually for much
longer, e.g., plant and machinery,
furniture and fixture, land and

Decision to invest in fixed assets
must be taken very carefully as the
investment is usually quite large.
Such decisions once taken are
irrevocable except at a huge loss.
Such decisions are called capital

term assets last for more than one year.
It must be financed through
long-term sources of capital such as
equity
preference
shares,
debentures, long-term loans and
retained earnings of the business.
Fixed Assets should never be financed
through short-term sources.
Investment in these assets would
include
expenditure
acquisition, expansion, modernisation
and their replacement. These decisions
include purchase of land, building,
plant and machinery, launching a new
product line or investing in advanced
techniques of production. Major
expenditures such as those on
advertising campaign or research and
development programme having long
term implications for the firm are also
examples of capital budgeting
decisions. The management of fixed
capital or investment or capital
budgeting decisions are important for
the following reasons:
Long-term growth: These decisions
have bearing on the long-term
growth. The funds invested in long-
term assets are likely to yield
returns in the future. These will
affect the future prospects of the
business.
(ii) Large amount of funds involved:
These decisions result in a
substantial portion of capital funds
being blocked in long-term projects.
Therefore, these investments are
planned after a detailed analysis is
undertaken. This may involve
decisions like where to procure
funds from and at what rate of
interest.
(iii) Risk involved: Fixed capital
involves investment of huge
amounts. It affects the returns of
the firm as a whole in the long-
term. Therefore, investment
decisions involving fixed capital
influence the overall business risk
complexion of the firm.
(iv) Irreversible decisions: These
decisions once taken, are not
reversible without incurring heavy
losses. Abandoning a project after
heavy investment is made is quite
costly in terms of waste of funds.
Therefore, these decisions should
be taken only after carefully
evaluating each detail or else the
adverse financial consequences
may be very heavy.

Apart from the investment in fixed

These assets, as noted earlier, are
expected to get converted into cash or
cash equivalents within a period of one
year. These provide liquidity to the
business. An asset is more liquid if it
can be converted into cash quicker and
without reduction in value. Insufficient
investment in current assets may
make it more difficult for an
organisation to meet its payment
obligations. However, these assets
provide little or low return. Hence, a
balance needs to be struck between
liquidity and profitability.
Current liabilities are those
payment obligations which are due for
payment within one year; such as bills
payable, creditors, outstanding
expenses and advances received from
customers, etc.
Some part of current assets is
usually financed through short-term
sources, i.e., current liabilities. The
rest is financed through long-term
sources and is called net working
capital. Thus, NWC = CA – CL (i.e.
Current Assets - Current Liabilities.)

”Its been a rather glamorous 18 months, with sales just huge,” says, CFO of PT Astra
International, the US $4 billion in sales Indonesian automaker. Indonesia is on the
growth path again, and a new breed of consumer is eager for a first vehicle – motorcycles
– as well as Astra’s more premium brands of Hondas and Toyotas. And one of the
most beautiful parts of the proposition is that working capital management seems to
be taking care of itself. “Depending on the business, and counting trade receivables
only, we have between eight and 19 days working capital,” which is manageable given
the company’s steady growth. One of the reasons that working capital has not expanded
at the rate of the business is inventory, or rather the dearth of it. “We’re in a market
that responds very strongly to new products,” says the manager “and the presales of
products are very high. We have advanced orders from four to six months, with
deposits paid, and this helps our cash position.” Best of all, as soon as a vehicle is off
the assembly line, it’s out to the dealer. “We have low inventory costs and the product
lines are very easy to move.” The salutary role of banks in working capital management
is one reason that cashflow has improved in his business. Better management is a
result of banking competition that has allowed the company to move from traditional
bankers, the state-owned Indian institutions, to more competitive private institutions
and the foreign banks that partner with them. These banks have invested in technology,
allowing a visibility over cashflow unheard of five years ago.

1. Nature of Business:
1. Nature of Business: The basic
nature of a business influences the
amount of working capital required. A
trading organisation usually needs a
smaller amount of working capital
compared to a manufacturing
organisation. This is because there is
usually no processing. Therefore, there
is no distinction between raw materials
and finished goods. Sales can be
effected immediately upon the receipt
of materials, sometimes even before
that. In a manufacturing business,
however, raw material needs to be
converted into finished goods before
any sales become possible. Other
factors remaining the same, a trading
business requires less working capital.
Similarly, service industries which
usually do not have to maintain
inventory require less working capital.

ratio may be achieved reducing the

Financial Planning and Importance Financial planning is essentially
preparation of a financial blueprint of an organisation’s future operations. The
objective of financial planning is to ensure that enough funds are available at
right time.
Financial planning strives to achieve the following twin objectives.
(a) To ensure availability of funds whenever these are required:
(b) To see that the firm does not raise resources unnecessarily:
Financial planning is an important part of overall planning of any business
enterprise. It aims at enabling the company to tackle the uncertainty in respect
of the availability and timing of the funds and helps in smooth functioning of
an organisation.

Capital Structure and Factors One of the important decisions under financial
management relates to the financing pattern or the proportion of the use of
different sources in raising funds. On the basis of ownership, the sources
of business finance can be broadly classified into two categories viz., ‘owners
funds’ and ‘borrowed funds’. Capital structure refers to the mix between owners
and borrowed funds.
Deciding about the capital structure of a firm involves determining the
relative proportion of various types of funds. This depends on various factors
which are: Cash Flow Position, Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR), Debt Service
Coverage Ratio (DSCR), Return on Investment (RoI), Cost of debt, Tax Rate,
Cost of Equity, Floatation Costs, Risk Consideration, Flexibility, Control,

to different projects or assets with long-term implications for the business.
These decisions are called investment decisions or capital budgeting decisions.
They affect the growth, profitability and risk of the business in the long run.
Factors affecting the Requirement of Fixed Capital are: Nature of Business,
Scale of Operations, Choice of Technique, Technology Upgradation, Growth
Prospects, Diversification, Financing Alternatives and Level of Collaboration.
Apart from the investment in fixed assets, every business organisation
needs to invest in current assets. This investment facilitates smooth day-to-

With the explosive growth of their
subscriber base, telecom companies
are all looking at capital markets to
raise funds to fuel their expansion
plan. Idea Cellular, the fifth largest
operator in the country and the
flagship telecom venture of AV Birla
Group, has decided to enter the capital
market to raise between Rs. 1,700 and
Rs. 2,000 crore.
The company has appointed J.M.
Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch among
other as book-runners for the
proposed Initial Public Offer (IPO),
which is expected to be ready by
January end.
Since, under SEBI norms, the
minimum float size is 10 per cent, the
company will divest between 10
and 12 per cent, “The last private
placement made by the promoters is
at a market capitalisation of
Rs. 15,000 crore. The proposed float
is expected to be at 10 to 20 per cent
premium of the private placement
price,” AV Birla Group recently
divested 35 per cent stake in the
company to a clutch of private equity
firms. However, this is a fresh issue of
shares, where the proceeds will be
utilised by Ideal Cellular for capital
expenditure. After the proposed
issues, the promoters stake will come
down to around 58 per cent.

You all know that a business needs
finance from the time an entrepreneur
makes the decision to start it. It needs
finance both for working capital
requirements such as payments for
raw materials and salaries to its
employees,
fixed
capital
expenditure such as the purchase of
machinery or building or to expand its
production capacity. The above
example gives a fair picture of how
companies need to raise funds from the
capital markets. Idea Cellular decided
to enter the Indian capital market for
its needs of expansion. In this chapter
you will study concepts like private
placement, Initial public Offer (IPO) and
capital markets which you come across
in the example of Idea Cellular.
Business can raise these funds from
various sources and in different ways
through financial markets. This
chapter provides a brief description of
the mechanism through which finances
are mobilised by a business organisation
for both short term and long term
requirements. It also explains the
institutional structure and the regulatory
measures for different financial markets.

A business is a part of an economic
system that consists of two main
sectors – households which save funds
and business firms which invest these
funds. A financial market helps to link
the savers and the investors by
mobilizing funds between them. In
doing so it performs what is known as
an allocative function. It allocates or
directs funds available for investment
into their most productive investment
opportunity. When the allocative
function is performed well, two
consequences follow:
The rate of return offered to
households would be higher
Scarce resources are allocated to
those firms which have the highest
productivity for the economy.
There are two major alternative
mechanisms through which allocation
of funds can be done: via banks or
via financial markets. Households can
deposit their surplus funds with
banks, who in turn could lend these
funds to business firms. Alternately,
households can buy the shares and
debentures offered by a business
using financial markets. The process
by which allocation of funds is done
is called financial intermediation.
Banks and financial markets are
competing intermediaries in the
financial system, and give households
a choice of where they want to place
their savings.

Financial markets provide valuable
information about securities being
traded in the market. It helps to save
time, effort and money that both
buyers and sellers of a financial asset
would have to otherwise spend to try
and find each other. The financial
market is thus, a common platform
where buyers and sellers can meet for
fulfillment of their individual needs.
Financial markets are classified on
the basis of the maturity of financial
instruments
traded
them.
Instruments with a maturity of less
than one year are traded in the money
market. Instruments with longer

The money market is a market for
short term funds which deals in
monetary assets whose period of
maturity is upto one year. These assets
are close substitutes for money. It is a
market where low risk, unsecured
and short term debt instruments that
are highly liquid are issued and
actively traded everyday. It has no
physical location, but is an activity
conducted over the telephone and
through the internet. It enables the
raising of short-term funds for meeting
the temporary shortages of cash and
obligations and the temporary
deployment of excess funds for earning
returns. The major participants in the
market are the Reserve Bank of India

Treasury Bill: A Treasury bill is
basically an instrument of short-term
borrowing by the Government of India
maturing in less than one year. They
are also known as Zero Coupon Bonds
issued by the Reserve Bank of India on
behalf of the Central Government to
meet its short-term requirement of
funds. Treasury bills are issued in the
form of a promissory note. They are
highly liquid and have assured yield
and negligible risk of default. They are
issued at a price which is lower than
their face value and repaid at par. The
difference between the price at which
the treasury bills are issued and their
redemption value is the interest
receivable on them and is called
discount. Treasury bills are available
for a minimum amount of Rs 25,000
and in multiples thereof.
Example:  Suppose an investor
purchases a 91 days Treasury bill with
a face value of Rs. 1,00,000 for
Rs. 96,000. By holding the bill until the
maturity date, the investor receives
Rs. 1,00,000. The difference of
Rs. 4,000 between the proceeds
received at maturity and the amount
paid to purchase the bill represents the
interest received by him.

paper is a short-term unsecured
promissory note, negotiable and
transferable by endorsement and
delivery with a fixed maturity period. It
is issued by large and creditworthy
companies to raise short-term funds at
lower rates of interest than market rates.
It usually has a maturity period of 15
days to one year. The issuance of
commercial paper is an alternative to
bank borrowing for large companies
that are generally considered to be
financially strong. It is sold at a discount
and redeemed at par. The original
purpose of commercial paper was to
provide short-terms funds for seasonal
and working capital needs. For example
companies use this instrument for
purposes such as bridge financing.
Example: Suppose a company needs
long-term finance to buy some
machinery. In order to raise the long
term funds in the capital market the
company will have to incur floatation
costs (costs associated with floating of
an issue are brokerage, commission,
printing of applications and advertising
etc.). Funds raised through commercial
paper are used to meet the floatation
costs. This is known as Bridge Financing.

Call Money: Call money is short
term finance repayable on demand, with
a maturity period of one day to fifteen
days, used for inter-bank transactions.
Commercial banks have to maintain a
minimum cash balance known as cash
reserve ratio. The Reserve Bank of India
changes the cash reserve ratio from time
to time which in turn affects the amount
of funds available to be given as loans
by commercial banks. Call money is a
method by which banks borrow from
each other to be able to maintain the

cash reserve ratio. The interest rate paid
on call money loans is known as the call
rate. It is a highly volatile rate that varies
from day-to-day and sometimes even
from hour-to-hour. There is an inverse
relationship between call rates and
other short-term money market
instruments such as certificates of
deposit and commercial paper. A rise in
call money rates makes other sources
of finance such as commercial paper
and certificates of deposit cheaper in
comparison for banks raise funds from
these sources.

which is used to finance the credit sales
of firms. When goods are sold on credit,
the buyer becomes liable to make
payment on a specific date in future.
The seller could wait till the specified
date or make use of a bill of exchange.
The seller (drawer) of the goods draws
the bill and the buyer (drawee) accepts
it. On being accepted, the bill becomes
a marketable instrument and is called
a trade bill. These bills can be
discounted with a bank if the seller
needs funds before the bill matures.
When a trade bill is accepted by a
commercial bank it is known as a
commercial bill.

The term capital market refers to facilities
and institutional arrangements through
which long-term funds, both debt and
equity are raised and invested. It
consists of a series of channels through
which savings of the community are
made available for industrial and
commercial enterprises and for the
public in general. It directs these savings
into their most productive use leading
to growth and development of the
economy. The capital market consists
of development banks, commercial
banks and stock exchanges.
An ideal capital market is one where
finance is available at reasonable cost.
The process of economic development
is facilitated by the existence of a well
functioning capital market. In fact,
development of the financial system is
seen as a necessary condition for
economic growth. It is essential that
financial institutions are sufficiently
developed and that market operations
are free, fair, competitive and
transparent. The capital market should
also be efficient in respect of the
information that it delivers, minimise
transaction costs and allocate capital
most productively.
The Capital Market can be divided
into two parts: a. Primary Market
b. Secondary Market
Distinction between Capital Market

Distinction between Capital Market
and Money Market
and Money Market

The major points of distinction between
the two markets are as follows:
Participants: The participants in the
capital market are financial
institutions, banks, corporate
entities, foreign investors and
ordinary retail investors from
members of the public. Participation
in the money market is by and large
undertaken by institutional
participants such as the RBI, banks,
financial institutions and finance
companies. Individual investors
although permitted to transact in the
secondary money market, do not
normally do so.
Instruments: The main instruments
traded in the capital market are –
equity shares, debentures, bonds,
preference shares etc. The main
instruments traded in the money
market are short term debt
instruments such as T-bills, trade
bills reports, commercial paper and
certificates of deposit.
(iii) Investment Outlay: Investment in the
capital market i.e. securities does not
necessarily require a huge financial
outlay. The value of units of
securities is generally low i.e. Rs 10,
Rs 100 and so is the case with
minimum trading lot of shares which
is kept small i.e. 5, 50, 100 or so. This
helps individuals with small savings
to subscribe to these securities. In the
money market, transactions entail
huge sums of money as the
instruments are quite expensive.
(iv) Duration: The capital market deals
in medium and long term securities
such as equity shares and
debentures.
Money
market
instruments have a maximum
tenure of one year, and may even
be issued for a single day.
2015-16(21/01/2015)
BUSINESS STUDIES
Liquidity: Capital market securities
are considered liquid investments
because they are marketable on
the stock exchanges. However, a
share may not be actively traded,
i.e. it may not easily find a buyer.
Money market instruments on the
other hand, enjoy a higher degree
of liquidity as there is formal
arrangement for this. The Discount
Finance House of India (DFHI) has
been established for the specific
objective of providing a ready
market for money market
instruments.
(vi) Safety:
Capital
market
instruments are riskier both with
respect to returns and principal
repayment. Issuing companies
may fail to perform as per
projections and promoters may
defraud investors. But the money
market is generally much safer
with a minimum risk of default.
This is due to the shorter duration
of investing and also to financial
soundness of the issuers, which
primarily are the government,
banks
highly
rated
companies.
(vii) Expected return: The investment
in capital markets generally yield
a higher return for investors than
the money markets. The possibility
of earnings is higher if the
securities are held for a longer
duration. First, there is the scope
of earning capital gains in equity
share. Second, in the long run, the
prosperity of a company is shared
by shareholders by way of high
dividends and bonus issues.

The primary market is also known as
the new issues market. It deals with
new securities being issued for the first
time. The essential function of a primary
market is to facilitate the transfer of
investible funds from savers to
entrepreneurs seeking to establish new
enterprises or to expand existing ones
through the issue of securities for the
first time. The investors in this market
are banks, financial institutions,
insurance companies, mutual funds
and individuals.
A company can raise capital
through the primary market in the form
of equity shares, preference shares,
debentures, loans and deposits. Funds
raised may be for setting up new
projects, expansion, diversification,
modernisation of existing projects,
mergers and takeovers etc.

History of the Stock Market in India
The history of the stock market in India goes back to the end of the eighteenth
century when long-term negotiable securities were first issued. In 1850 the
Companies Act was introduced for the first time bringing with it the feature of
limited liability and generating investor interest in corporate securities. The
first stock exchange in India was set-up in 1875 as The Native Share and
Stock Brokers Association in Bombay. Today it is known as the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE). This was followed by the development of exchanges in
Ahmedabad (1894), Calcutta(1908) and Madras(1937). It is interesting to note
that stock exchanges were first set up in major centers of trade and commerce.
Until the early 1990s, the Indian secondary market comprised regional
stock exchanges with BSE heading the list. After the reforms of 1991, the
Indian secondary market acquired a three tier form. This consists of:
• Regional Stock Exchanges
• National Stock Exchange (NSE)
• Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)
stock exchange. This is called an Initial
Public Offer (IPO). SEBI registered
brokers have to be appointed for the
purpose of accepting applications and
placing orders with the company. The
issuer company should also appoint a
registrar to the issue having electronic
connectivity with the exchange. The
issuer company can apply for listing of
its securities on any exchange other
than the exchange through which it has

The secondary market is also known
as the stock market or stock exchange.
It is a market for the purchase and sale
of existing securities. It helps existing
investors to disinvest and fresh
investors to enter the market. It also
provides liquidity and marketability to
existing securities. It also contributes
to economic growth by channelising
funds towards the most productive
investments through the process of
disinvestment and reinvestment.
Securities are traded, cleared and
settled within the regulatory framework
prescribed by SEBI. Advances in
information technology have made
trading through stock exchanges
accessible from anywhere in the
country through trading terminals.
Along with the growth of the primary
market in the country, the secondary
market has also grown significantly
during the last ten years.

Trading in securities is now executed
through an on-line, screen-based
electronic trading system. Simply put,
all buying and selling of shares and
debentures are done through a
computer terminal.
There was a time when in the open
outcry system, securities were bought
and sold on the floor of the stock
exchange. Under this auction system,
deals were struck among brokers,
prices were shouted out and the shares
sold to the highest bidder. However,
now almost all exchanges have gone
electronic and trading is done in the
broker’s office through a computer
terminal. A stock exchange has its main
computer system with many terminals
spread across the country. Trading in
securities is done through brokers who
are members of the stock exchange.
Trading has shifted from the stock
market floor to the brokers office.
Every broker has to have access to
a computer terminal that is connected
to the main stock exchange. In this
screen-based trading, a member logs
on to the site and any information
about the shares (company, member,
etc.) he wishes to buy or sell and the
price is fed into the computer. The
software is so designed that the
transaction will be executed when a
matching order is found from a counter
party. The whole transaction is carried
on the computer screen  with both the
parties being able to see the prices of
all shares going up and down  at all
times during the time that business is
transacted and during business hours
of the stock exchange. The computer
in the brokers office is constantly
matching the orders at the best bid and
offer price. Those that are not matched
remain on the screen and are open for
future matching during the day.
Electronic trading systems or
screen-based trading has certain
advantages:
1. It ensures transparency as it allows
participants to see the prices of all
securities in the market while
business is being transacted. They
Electronic Trading System
2015-16(21/01/2015)
FINANCIAL MARKET
are able to see the full market
during real time.
2. It increases efficiency of information
being passed on, thus helping in
fixing prices efficiently. The
computer
screens
display
information on prices and also
capital market developments that
influence share prices.
3. It increases the efficiency of
operations, since there is reduction
in time, cost and risk of error.
4. People from all over the country
and even abroad who wish to
participate in the stock market can
buy or sell securities through
brokers or members without
knowing each other. That is, they
can sit in the broker’s office, log on
to the computer at the same time
and buy or sell securities. This
system has enabled a large number
of participants to trade with each
other, thereby improving the
liquidity of the market.
5. A single trading platform has been
provided as business is transacted
at the same time in all the trading
centres. Thus, all the trading
centres spread all over the country
have been brought onto one
trading platform, i.e., the stock
exchange, on the computer.
Now, screen-based trading or on-line
trading is the only way in which you
can buy or sell shares. Shares can be
held either in physical form or an
electronic book entry form of holding
and transferring shares can also be
adopted. This electronic form is called
dematerialised form.

Settlement Procedure
It has been made compulsory to settle
all trades within 2 days of the trade
date, i.e., on a T+2 basis, since 2003.
Prior to the reforms, securities were
bought and sold, i.e., traded and all
positions in the stock exchange were
settled on a weekly/fortnightly
settlement cycle whether it was delivery
of securities or payment of cash. This
system prevailed for a long time as it
increased the volume of trading on the
exchange and provided liquidity to the
system. However, since trades were to
be settled on specified dates, this gave
rise to speculation and price of shares
used to rise and fall suddenly due to
trading and defaults by brokers. A new
system, i.e, rolling settlement, was
introduced in 2000, so that whenever
a trade took place it would be settled
after some days. Since 2003, all shares
have to be covered under the rolling
settlement system on a T+2 basis,
meaning thereby that transactions in
securities are settled within 2 days after
the trade date. Since rolling settlement
implies fast movement of shares, it
requires effective implementation of
electronic
transfer
dematerialisation of shares.
The following steps are involved in
the screen-based trading for buying
and selling of securities:
2015-16(21/01/2015)
BUSINESS STUDIES
1. If an investor wishes to buy or sell
any security he has to first
approach a registered broker or
sub-broker and enter into an
agreement with him. The investor
has to sign a broker-client
agreement and a client registration
form before placing an order to buy
or sell securities. He has also to
provide certain  other details and
information. These include:
PAN number
(This is mandatory)
Date of birth and address.
Educational qualification and
occupation.
Residential status (Indian/NRI).
Bank account details.
Depository account details.
Name of any other broker with
whom registered.
Client code number in the client
registration form.
The broker then opens a trading
account in the name of the investor.
2. The investor has to open a ‘demat’
account or ‘beneficial owner’ (BO)
account with a depository
participant (DP) for holding and
transferring securities in the demat
form. He will also have to open a
bank account for cash transactions
in the securities market.
3. The investor then places an order
with the broker to buy or sell
shares. Clear instructions have to
be given about the number of
shares and the price at which the
shares should be bought or sold.
The broker will then go ahead with
the deal at the above mentioned
price or the best price available.  An
order confirmation slip is issued to
the investor by the broker.
4. The broker then will go on-line and
connect to the main stock exchange
and match the share and best price
available.
5. When the shares can be bought or
sold at the price mentioned, it will
be communicated to the broker’s
terminal and the order will be
executed electronically. The broker
will issue a trade confirmation slip
to the investor.
6. After the trade has been executed,
within 24 hours the broker issues
a Contract Note. This note contains
details of the number of shares
bought or sold, the price, the date
and time of deal, and the brokerage
charges. This is an important
document as it is legally enforceable
and helps to settle disputes/claims
between the investor and the
broker. A Unique Order Code
number is assigned to each
transaction by the stock exchange
and is printed on the contract note.
7. Now, the investor has to deliver the
shares sold or pay cash for the
shares bought. This should be done
immediately after receiving the
2015-16(21/01/2015)
FINANCIAL MARKET
contract note or before the day when
the broker shall make payment or
delivery of shares to the exchange.
This is called the pay-in day.
8. Cash is paid or securities are
delivered on pay-in day, which is
before the T+2 day as the deal has
to be settled and finalised on the
T+2 day. The settlement cycle is on
T+2 day on a rolling settlement
basis, w.e.f. 1 April 2003.
9. On the T+2 day, the exchange will
deliver the share or make payment
to the other broker. This is called
the pay-out day. The broker then
has to make payment to the
investor within 24 hours of the pay-
out day since he has already
received payment from the
exchange.
10.The broker can make delivery of
shares in demat form directly to the
investor’s demat account. The
investor  has to give details of his
demat account and instruct his
depository participant to take
delivery of securities directly in his
beneficial owner account.

All trading in securities is now done
through computer terminals. Since all
systems are computerised, buying and
selling of securities are settled through
an electronic book entry form. This is
mainly done to eliminate problems like
theft, fake/forged transfers, transfer
delays and paperwork associated with
share certificates or debentures held in
physical form.
This   is a process where securities
held by the investor in the physical
form are cancelled and the investor is
given an electronic entry or number so
that she/he can hold it as an electronic
balance in an account. This process of
holding securities in an electronic form
is called dematerialisation. For this, the
investor has to open a demat account
with an organisation called a
depository. In fact, now all Initial Public
Offers
(IPOs)
issued
dematerialisation form and more than
99% of the turnover is settled by
delivery in the demat form.
The Securities and Exchange Board
of India (SEBI) has made it mandatory
for the settlement procedures to take
place in demat form in certain select
securities. Holding shares in demat
form is very convenient as it is just
like a bank account. Physical shares
can be converted into electronic form
or electronic holdings can be
reconverted into physical certificates
(rematerialisation). Dematerialisation
enables shares to be transferred to
some other account just like cash and
ensures settlement of all trades
through a single account in shares.
These demat securities can even be
pledged or hypothecated to get loans.
There is no danger of loss, theft or
forgery of share certificates. It is the
broker’s responsibility to credit the
investor’s account with the correct
number of shares.

Just like a bank keeps money in safe
custody for customers, a depository
also is like a bank and keeps securities
in electronic form on behalf of the
investor. In the depository a securities
account can be opened, all shares can
be deposited, they can be withdrawn/
sold at any time and instruction to
deliver or receive shares on behalf of the
investor can be given. It is a technology
driven electronic storage system. It has
no paper work relating to share
certificates, transfer, forms, etc. All
transactions of the investors are settled
with greater speed, efficiency and use
as all securities are entered in a book
entry mode.
In India, there are two depositories.
National Securities Depositories
Limited (NSDL) is the first and largest
depository presently operational in
India. It was promoted as a joint
venture of the IDBI, UTI, and the
National Stock Exchange.
The Central Depository Services
Limited (CDSL) is the second depository
to commence operations and was
promoted by the Bombay Stock
Exchange and the Bank of India. Both
these national level depositories operate
through intermediaries who are
electronically connected to the
depository and serve as contact points
with the investors and are called
depository participants.
The depository participant (DP)
serves as an intermediary between the
investor and the Depository (NSDL or
CSDL) who is authorised to maintain
the accounts of dematerialised shares.
Financial institutions, banks, clearing
corporations, stock brokers and non-
banking finance corporations are

permitted to become depository
participants. If the investor is buying
and selling the securities through the
broker or the bank or a non-banking
finance corporation, it acts as a DP for
the investor and complete the
formalities.

Have you counted the number of times newspaper headlines in the past few
weeks have been discussing the SENSEX? It goes up and down all the time and
seems to be a very important part of business and economic news. Has that
made you wonder what the SENSEX actually is?
The SENSEX is the benchmark index of the BSE. Since the BSE has been the
leading exchange of the Indian secondary market, the SENSEX has been an
important indicator of the Indian stock market. It is the most frequently used
indicator while reporting on the state of the market. An index has just one job: to
capture the price movement. So a stock index will reflect the price movements of
shares while a bond index captures the manner in which bond prices go up or
down. If the SENSEX rises, it indicates the market is doing well. Since stocks are
supposed to reflect what companies expect to earn in the future, a rising index
indicates that investors expect better earnings from companies. It is also a measure
of the state of the Indian economy. If Indian companies are expected to do well,
obviously the economy should do well too.
The SENSEX, launched in 1986 is made up of 30 of the most actively traded
stocks in the market. In fact, they account for half the BSE’s market capitalisation.
They represent 13 sectors of the economy and are leaders in their respective
industries.

increasing participation of the public.
This ever expanding investors
population and market capitalisation
led to a variety of malpractices on the
part of companies, brokers, merchant
bankers, investment consultants and
others involved in the securities market.
The glaring examples of these
malpractices include existence of self –
styled merchant bankers unofficial
private placements, rigging of prices,
unofficial premium on new issues, non-
adherence of provisions of the
Companies Act, violation of rules and
regulations of stock exchanges and
listing requirements, delay in delivery
of shares etc. These malpractices and
unfair trading practices have eroded
investor confidence and multiplied
investor grievances. The Government
and the stock exchanges were rather
helpless in redressing the investor’s
problems because of lack of proper
penal provisions in the existing
legislation. In view of the above, the
Government of India decided to set-up
a separate regulatory body known as
Securities and Exchange Board of
India.

Purpose and Role of SEBI
The basic purpose of SEBI is to create
an environment to facilitate efficient
mobilisation and allocation of resources
through the securities markets. It also
aims to stimulate competition and
encourage innovation. This environment
includes rules and regulations,
institutions and their interrelationships,
instruments, practices, infrastructure
and policy framework.
This environment aims at meeting
the needs of the three groups which
basically constitute the market, viz,
the issuers of securities (Companies),
the investors and the market
intermediaries.
To the issuers, it aims to provide a
market place in which they can
confidently look forward to raising
finances they need in an easy, fair
and efficient manner.
To the investors, it should provide
protection of their rights and
interests through adequate,
accurate and authentic information
and disclosure of information on a
continuous basis.

As SEBI is a statutory body there has
been a considerable expansion in the
range and scope of its activities. Each of
the activities of the SEBI now demands
more careful, closer, co-ordinated and
intensive attention to enable it to attain
its objectives. Accordingly, SEBI has
been restructured and rationalised in
tune with its expanded scope. It has
decided its activities into five operational
departments. Each department is
headed by an executive director. Apart
from its head office at Mumbai, SEBI has
opened regional offices in Kolkalta,
Chennai, and Delhi to attend to investor
complaints and liaise with the issuers,
intermediaries and stock exchanges in
the concerned region.
The SEBI also formed two advisory
committees. They are the Primary
Market Advisory Committee and the
Secondary
Market
Advisory
Committee. These committees consist
of the market players, the investors
associations recognised by the SEBI
and the eminent persons in the capital
market. They provide important inputs
to the SEBI’s policies.
The objectives of the two
Committees are as follows:
To advise SEBI on matters relating
to the regulation of intermediaries
for ensuring investors protection in
the primary market.
b. To advise SEBI on issues related to
the development of primary market
in India.

detected in the YES Bank’s IPO.
SEBI said in IDFC’s IPO too four investors opened as many as 14,807
dematerialised accounts with Karvy-DP and ‘Strangely’, all these account
holders have their bank accounts with Bharat Overseas Bank Ltd.,

It is an undisputed fact that a company’s
survival does not depend upon its
consumers alone, but a diverse set of
stakeholders like the government,
religious leaders, social activists, NGOs,
media, etc. Hence, earning the
satisfaction of these segments is also as
imperative as they add to the power of
the brand by word of mouth.
The social concern adds to the
strength of the brand. Corporates that
embraced the deepest social values,
have been successful in building
powerful brand, and, eventually, robust
customer relationship. The area of
corporate social justice fall under two
broad categories. The issues such as the
nutrition of children, child care, old-age
homes, amelioration of hunger, offering
aid to those affected by natural
calamities, etc. needing instant attention
with humanitarian perspective, comes
under the first category.
The issues that contribute to
making society a pleasant place to live
in the long run, may be grouped under
the second category. The issues which
come under this category are health
awareness and aid, education,
environmental protection, women’s
employment and empowerment,
preventing unjust discriminations (on
the basis of caste, community, religion,
ethnicity, race, and sex), eradication of
poverty

MARKETING
Let us consider a typical day in our life.
Right from the time we get up in the
morning to the time we go to bed, we
use number of products to satisfy our
different needs. Beginning with the
breakfast, we take such items as bread,
butter, milk, and rice, to satisfy our
hunger; use the services of a bus or an
auto or a cycle to reach to our school
or place of work; read books, magazines
and newspapers, to keep ourselves
informed and acquire knowledge; use
computers, cell phone, television and
other gadgets for communication/
entertainment; and purchase many
other products like gifts, shoes,
clothing, furniture, etc., from market
to satisfy our different needs.
Who makes these products and
why? These products are manufactured
and marketed by different firms. For
example, Lifebouy soap, Closeup
toothpaste, Surf detergent powder are
manufactured by Hindustan Lever;
Ariel detergent powder by Procter and
Gamble, Dairy Milk Chocolate by
Nestle, Atlas Cycles by Atlas cycle
company, Kwality Ice-creams by
Kwality Walls, LG Televisions by LG
Electronics and so on. These firms are
called marketers. These firms
undertake various activities to
stimulate the demand for their
products and earn profit by satisfying
customer’s needs and wants. People
purchase products because these
satisfy some of their needs.
Number of activities are performed
by the marketers to facilitate exchange
of goods and services between
producers and the users of such
products. These activities are referred
to as marketing activities.
For a proper understanding of
marketing, number of questions need
to be answered. These include: What
do we mean by a market? What can be
marketed? Is it products or services or
something more? Who is a marketer?
What is marketing management?
These points have been taken up for
discussion in the following sections.
Infosys Technologies, the leading software consulting service provider, has been
certified ISO 14001, compliant by Det Norske Veritas for its development centers in
Pune, Chennai, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, Mangalore, Mohali, and
Mysore, for its ‘Ozone Initiative’. Through this initiative, Infosys has committed for
continual improvement.
Procter and Gamble’s (P&G) philosophy is that it should lead the industry in
implementing a global environmental programme. P&G is one of the first companies
in the world to actively study the influence of consumer products on the environment
and introduce concentrated products, recycled plastic bottles, and refill packages
to the industry. The overall packaging per case has been reduced by an average of
27% and a reduction of 37% in air, waste, and water emissions has been achieved
consistently since 1990. P&G contributes to sustainable development and addresses
environmental and social issues connected with its products and services.

In the traditional sense, the term
‘market’ refers to the place where
buyers and sellers gather to enter into
transactions involving the exchange of
goods and services. It is in this sense
that this term is being used in day to
day language, even today. The other
ways in which this term is being used
is in the context of a product market
(cotton market, gold or share market),
geographic market  (national and
international market), type of buyers
(consumer market and industrial
market) and the quantity of goods
transacted  (retail market and
wholesale market).
But in modern marketing sense,
the term market has a broader
meaning. It refers to a set of actual and
potential buyers of a product or service.
For example, when a fashion designer
designs a new dress and offers it for
exchange, all the people who are willing
to buy and offer some value for it can
be stated to be the market for that
dress. Similarly, market for fans or
bicycles or electric bulbs or shampoos
refers to all the actual and potential
buyers for these products.

The term marketing has been described
by different people in different ways.
Some people believe that marketing is
same as ‘shopping’. Whenever they go
out for shopping of certain products or
services, they describe it as marketing.
There are some other people who
confuse marketing with ‘selling’ and
feel that marketing activity starts after
a product or service has been
produced. Some people describe it to
mean ‘merchandising’ or designing a
product. All these descriptions may be
partly correct but marketing is a much
broader concept, which is discussed as
follows:
Traditionally, marketing has been
described in terms of its functions or
activities. In this respect, marketing
has been referred to as performance
of business activities that direct the
flow of goods and services from
producers to consumers.
As we know, most of the
manufacturing firms do not produce
goods for their own consumption but
for the consumption or use by others.
Therefore, to move the goods and
services from the producer to consumers,
“Business is not financial science, it’s about trading, buying and selling. It’s
about creating a product or service so good that people will pay for it.”

MARKETING
a number of activities, such as product
designing or merchandising, packaging,
warehousing, transportation, branding,
selling, advertising and pricing are
required. All these activities are
referred to as marketing activities.
Thus, ‘merchandising’, ‘selling’ and
distribution are all parts of a large
number of activities undertaken by a firm,
which are collectively called marketing.
It may be noted here that marketing
is not merely a post-production activity.
It includes many activities that are
performed even before goods are
actually produced, and continue even
after the goods have been sold. For
example,
activities
identification of customer needs,
collection of information for developing
the product, designing suitable product
package and giving it a brand name
are performed before commencement
of the actual production. Similarly,
many follow up activities are required
for maintaining good customer
relations for procuring repeat sale.
In modern times, emphasis is
placed on describing marketing as a
social process. It is a process whereby
people exchange goods and services for
money or for something of value to
them. Taking the social perspective,
Phillip Kolter has defined marketing as,
“a social process by which individual
groups obtain what they need and want
through creating offerings and freely
exchanging products and services of
value with others”.
Thus, marketing is a social process
where in people interact with others,
in order to persuade them to act in a
particular way, say to purchase a
product or a service, rather than forcing
them to do so. A careful analysis of the
definition shows the following
important features of marketing:
1. Need
Needs and Want
and Want
and Want
and Want
and Wants: : : : : The process of
marketing helps individuals and
groups in obtaining what they need and
want. Thus, the primary reason or
motivation for people to engage in the
process of marketing is to satisfy some
of their needs or wants. In other words,
the focus of the marketing process is
on satisfaction of the needs and wants
of individuals and organisations.
A need is a state of felt deprivation
or feeling of being deprived of
something. If unsatisfied, it leaves a
person unhappy and uncomfortable.
For example, on getting hungry, we
become uncomfortable and start
looking for objects that are capable of
satisfying our hunger.
Needs are basic to human beings
and do not pertain to a particular
product. Wants, on the other hand,
are culturally defined objects that are
potential satisfiers of needs. In other
words, human needs shaped by such
factors as culture, personality and
religion are called wants. A basic need
for food, for example, may take
various forms such as want for dosa
and rice for a South Indian and
chapatti and vegetables for a North
Indian person.
A marketer’s job in an organisation
is to identify needs of the target
customers and develop products and
services that satisfy such needs.

Creating a Market Offering: On the
part of the marketers, the effort
involves creation of a ‘market offering.
Market offering refers to a complete
offer for a product or service, having
given features like size, quality, taste,
etc; at a certain price; available at a
given outlet or location and so on. Let
us say the offer is for a cell phone,
available in four different versions, on
the basis of certain features such as
size of memory, television viewing,
internet, camera, etc., for a given price,
say between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 20,000
(depending on the model selected),
available for sale at say firm’s exclusive
shops in and around all metropolitan
cities in the country. A good ‘market
offer’ is the one which is developed after
analysing the needs and preferences
of the potential buyers.

3. Customer Value: The process of
marketing facilitates exchange of
products and services between the
buyers and the sellers. The buyers,
however, make buying decisions on
their perceptions of the value of the
product or service in satisfying their
need, in relation to its cost. A product
will be purchased only if it is perceived
to be giving greatest benefit or value
for the money. The job of a marketer,
therefore, is to add to the value of the
product so that the customers prefer
it in relation to the competing products
and decide to purchase it.

4. Exchange Mechanism: The
process of marketing works through
the exchange mechanism. The
individuals (buyers and sellers) obtain
what they need and want through the
process of exchange. In other words,
the process of marketing involves
exchange of products and services for
money or something considered
valuable by the people.
Exchange refers to the process
through which two or more parties
come together to obtain the desired
product or service from someone,
offering the same by giving something
in return. For example, a person
feeling hungry may get food by offering
to give money or some other product
or service in return to someone who
is willing to accept the same for food.
In the modern world, goods are
produced at different places and are
distributed over a wide geographical
area through various middlemen,
involving exchanges at different levels
of distribution. Exchange is, therefore,
referred to as the essence of
marketing. For any exchange to take
place, it is important that the following
conditions are satisfied:
(i) involvement of at least two parties
viz., the buyer and the seller.
(ii) each party should be capable of
offering something of value to the
other. For example, the seller offers
a product and the buyer, money.
(iii) each party should have the ability
to communicate and deliver the
product or service. No exchange
can take place if the buyers and
sellers
communicate with each other or if
they can not deliver something of
value to the other.
2015-16(21/01/2015)
MARKETING
(iv) each party should have freedom to
accept or reject other party’s offer.
(v) the parties should be willing to
enter into transaction with each
other. Thus, the acceptance or
rejection of the offer takes place on
voluntary basis rather than on the
bases of any compulsion.
The points listed above are the
necessary conditions for an exchange
to take place. Whether the exchange
actually takes place or not depends
on the suitability of the act of exchange
to both the parties, whether it makes
the parties better off or at least not
worse off.
Another important point to be
noted is that Marketing is not merely a
business phenomena or confined only
to business organisations. Marketing
activities are equally relevant to non-

MARKETED?
The question commonly coming to the
mind is what can be marketed. Is it a
product or service or something else. Let
us first understand what is a product?
A product is a ‘bundle of utilities’
or ‘source of satisfaction’, that can be
used to satisfy human needs and
wants. It is not confined to physical
objects, such as motor cycle, biscuit,
bulb and pencil but also refers to other
things of value such as services, ideas,
places, etc., that can be offered to the
potential buyers for their use. In the
marketing literature, anything that can
be of value to the buyer can be termed
as a ‘product’. It can be tangible, i.e.,
which can be felt, seen and touched
physically such as a pencil, a cycle or
an intangible such as services rendered
by a doctor, hairdresser or a lawyer.
Apart from the product, what can
be marketed is a service or a person
(say political parties persuading to
vote for a particular candidate) or an
idea (say Red Cross persuading to
donate blood) or a place (say Kerala
Tourism persuading people to visit
Kerala for health tourism). Thus,
anything that is of value to the other
can be marketed. It can be a product
or a service or a person or a place or
an idea or an event or an organisation
or experience or properties. (see box)

to any person who takes more active
part in the process of exchange.
Normally it is the seller who is more
active in the exchange process as he/
she analyses the needs of the potential
buyers, develops a market offering and
persuades the buyers to buy the
product. However, there may be
certain situations where the buyer
may be taking more active role in the
exchange process. Let us say in
situations of rare supply, the buyer
may be taking extra efforts in
persuading the seller to sell the
product to him/her. This may be
happening in defence deals or take a
situation where a country having
installed a nuclear plant needs the
supply of nuclear fuel or ‘Heavy Water’.
It may need to convince the supplier
of the products to supply the same to
it, by promising that it will be used
for peaceful purposes only. In this
case, the buyer will be treated as the
marketer. Thus, any body, who takes

Marketing management means
management of the marketing
function. In other words, marketing
management refers to planning,
organising, directing and control of the
activities which facilitate exchange of
goods and services between producers
and consumers or users of products
and services. Thus the focus of
marketing management is on achieving
desired exchange outcomes with the
target markets. Taking a management
perspective, the term marketing has
been defined as “the process of
planning and executing the conception,
pricing, promotion and distribution of
ideas, goods and services to create
exchanges that satisfy individual and
organisational goals” by American
Management Association, similarly
Philip Kotler has defined Marketing
management as the art and science of
choosing target markets and getting,
keeping and growing customers
through creating, delivering and
communicating superior customer
values of management.
A careful analysis of the definition
reveals
process
management of marketing involves:
(i) Choosing a target market, say a
manufacturer may choose to make
readymade garments for children
up to the age of 5 years;
(ii) In respect of the target market
chosen, the focus of the process of
management is on getting, keeping
as well as growing the customers.
That means the marketer has to
create demand for his products so
that the target customers
purchase the product, keep them
satisfied with the firm’s products
and also attract more customers
to the firm’s products so that the
firm can grow; and
(iii) The mechanism for achieving the
objective is through creating,
developing and communicating
superior values for the customers.
That means, the primary job of a
marketing manager is to create
superior values so that the
customers are attracted to the
products and services and
communicate these values to the
prospective buyers and persuade
them to buy these products.
Marketing management involves
performance of various functions such
as analysing and planning the
marketing activities, implementing
marketing plans and setting control
mechanism. These functions are to be
performed in such a way that
organisation’s objectives are achieved
at the minimum cost.
Marketing management generally
is related to creation of demand.
However, in certain situations, the
manager has to restrict the demand.
For example, if there is a situation of
‘overfull demand’, i.e., the demand
being more than what the company
can or want to handle, (like what the
situation in our country was before the
adoption of policies of liberalisation

and globalisation, in early 90’s, in most
consumer products be it automobiles
or electronics goods or other durable
products. The job of marketing
mangers, in these situations would be
to find ways to reduce the demand
temporarily by say reducing the
expenditure on promotion or
increasing the prices. Similarly, if the
demand is ‘irregular’, such as in case
of seasonal products, (say fans, woollen
clothes) the marketer’s job is to change
the time pattern of demand through
such methods as providing short-term
incentives, to the buyers. Thus, the
marketing management in not only
concerned with creating demand but
with managing the demand effectively,
as per the situation in the market.

Many people confuse ‘selling’ for
‘marketing’. They consider these two
terms as one and the same. Marketing
refers to a large set of activities of which
selling is just one part. For example, a
marketer of televisions, before making
the sale, does a lot of other activities such
as planning the type and model of
televisions to be produced, the price at
which it would be sold and selecting the
distribution outlets at which the same
would be available, etc. In short,
marketing involves whole range of
activities relating to planning, pricing,
promoting and distributing the
products that satisfy customer’s needs.
The function of selling, on the other
hand, is restricted to promotion
of goods and services through
salesmanship, advertising, publicity
and short-term incentives so that title
of the product is transferred from seller
to buyer or in other words product is
converted into cash.
The major differences between
selling and marketing are listed as
below:
Part of the Process vs Wider Term:
Selling is only a part of the process
of marketing and is concerned with
promoting and transferring
possession and ownership of goods
from the seller to the buyer.
Marketing is a much wider term
consisting of number of activities
such as identification of the
customer’s needs, developing the
products to satisfy these needs,
fixing prices and persuading the
potential buyers to buy the same.
Thus, selling is merely a part of
marketing.
(ii) Transfer of Title vs Satisfying
Customer Needs: The main focus
of selling is on affecting transfer
of title and possession of goods
from sellers to consumers or users.
In contrast, marketing activities
put greater thrust on achieving
maximum satisfaction of the
customer’s needs and wants.
(iii) Profit through Maximising Sales vs
Customer Satisfaction: All selling
activities are directed at maximising
sales and, thereby, the profits of the
firm. In other words, the emphasis
is on profit maximisation through
maximisation of sales. Marketing,
2015-16(21/01/2015)
MARKETING
on the other hand, is concerned with
customer satisfaction and thereby
increasing profit in the long run. A
marketing organisation, thus,
attaches highest importance to
customer satisfaction as a route to
profit maximisation.
(iv) Start and End of the Activities:
Selling activities start after the
product has been developed while,
marketing activities start much
before the product is produced and
continue even after the product
has been sold.
(v) Difference in the Emphasis: In
selling, the emphasis is on bending
the customer according to the
product while in marketing, the
attempt is to develop the product
and other strategies as per the
customer needs.
vi. Difference in the Strategies: Selling
involves efforts like promotion and
persuasion while marketing uses
integrated marketing efforts
involving strategies in respect of
product, promotion, pricing and
physical distribution.

In order to achieve desired exchange
outcomes with target markets, it is
important to decide what philosophy
or thinking should guide the marketing
efforts of an organisation. An
understanding of the philosophy or the
concept to be adopted is important as
it determines the emphasis or the
weightage to be put on different factors,
in achieving the organisational
objectives. For example, whether the
marketing efforts of an organisation will
focus on the product—say designing its
features etc or on selling techniques or
on customer’s needs or the social
concerns.
The concept or philosophy of
marketing has evolved over a period
of time, and is discussed as follows.
The Production Concept

The Production Concept
During the earlier days of industrial
revolution, the demand for industrial
goods started picking up but the
number of producers were limited. As
a result, the demand exceeded the
supply. Selling was no problem.
Anybody who could produce the goods
was able to sell. The focus of business
activities was, therefore, on production
of goods. It was believed that profits
could be maximised by producing at
large scale, thereby reducing the
average cost of production. It was also
assumed that consumers would
favour those products which were
widely available at an affordable price.
Thus, availability and affordability of
the product were considered to be the
key to the success of a firm. Therefore,
greater emphasis was placed on
improving the production and
distribution efficiency of the firms.
The Product Concept

As a result of emphasis on production
capacity during the earlier days, the
position of supply increased over period

of the product could not ensure

increased sale and as such the survival
and growth of the firm. Thus, with the
increase in the supply of the products,
customers started looking for products
which were superior in quality,
performance and features. Therefore,
the emphasis of the firms shifted from
quantity of production to quality of
products. The focus of business activity
changed to bringing continuous
improvement
quality,
incorporating new features etc. Thus,
product improvement became the key
to profit maximisation of a firm, under
the concept of product orientation.
The Selling Concept

With the passage of time, the
marketing environment underwent
further change. The increase in the
scale of business further improved the
position with respect to supply of
goods, resulting in increased
competition among sellers. The
product quality and availability did not
ensure the survival and growth of
firms because of the large number of
sellers selling quality products. This
led to greater importance to attracting
and persuading customers to buy the
product. The business philosophy
changed. It was assumed that the
customers would not buy, or not buy
enough, unless they are adequately
convinced and motivated to do so.
Therefore, firms must undertake
aggressive selling and promotional
efforts to make customers buy their
products. The use of promotional
techniques such as advertising,
personal selling and sales promotion
were considered essential for selling of
products. Thus, the focus of business
firms shifted to pushing the sale of
products through aggressive selling
techniques with a view to persuade,
lure or coax the buyers to buy the
products. Making sale through any
means became important. It was
assumed that buyers can be
manipulated but what was forgotten
was that in the long run what matters
most is the customer satisfaction,
rather than anything else.

Marketing orientation implies that
focus on satisfaction of customer’s
needs is the key to the success of any
organisation in the market. It assumes
that in the long run an organisation
achieve
objective
maximisation of profit by identifying
the needs of its present and
prospective buyers and satisfying
them in an effective way. All the
decisions in a firm are taken from the
point of view of the customers. In other
words, customer’s satisfaction become
the focal point of all decision making
in the organisation. For example, what
product will be produced, with what
features and at what price shall it be
sold, or where shall it be made
available for sale will depend on what
do the customers want. If the
customers want features like double
door in a refrigerator or a separate
provision for water cooler in it, the
organisation would produce a
refrigerator with these features, would
price it at a level which the customers

quality, packing or brand name, but
because they satisfy a specific need of

success of any organisation, therefore,
is to understand and respond to
customer needs.
are willing to pay and so on. If all
marketing decisions are taken with this
prospective, selling will not be any
problem. It will automatically follow.
The basic role of a firm then is to
‘identify a need and fill it’. The concept
implies that products ad-services are

To sum up, the marketing concept
is based on the following pillars:
Identification of market or
customer who are chosen as the
target of marketing effort.
Understanding needs and wants
of customers in the target market.
(iii) Development of products or
services for satisfying needs of the
target market.
Satisfying needs of target market
better than the competitors.
Doing all this at a profit.
Thus, the focus of the marketing
concept is on customer needs and the
customer satisfaction becomes the
means to achieving the firms’ objective
of maximising profit. The purpose of
marketing is to generate customer
value at a profit.

The marketing concept, as described
in the preceeding section cannot be
considered as adequate if we look at
the challenges posed by social
problems
environmental
pollution, deforestation, shortage of
resources, population explosion and
inflation. It is so because any activity
which satisfies human needs but is
detrimental to the interests of the
society at large cannot be justified. The
business
orientation
should,
therefore, not be short-sighted to serve
only consumers’ needs. It should also
consider large issues of long-term
social welfare, as illustrated above.
The societal marketing concept
holds that the task of any organisation
is to identify the needs and wants of
the target market and deliver the
desired satisfaction in an effective and
efficient manner so that the long-term
well-being of the consumers and the
society is taken care of. Thus, the
societal marketing concept is the
extension of the marketing concept as
supplemented by the concern for the
long-term welfare of the society. Apart
from the customer satisfaction, it pays
attention to the social, ethical and
ecological aspects of marketing. There
are large number of such issues that
need to be attended.

deciding what opportunities can best

growth is predicted in several areas in
the Indian economy, say in the use of
the Internet, market for cell phones and
several other areas. Which of these
areas a particular organisation should
enter, or in which area should it expand,
requires a careful scanning of the
strengths and weaknesses of the
organisation, which is done with the
help of careful market analysis.
With the growth of computers, a
new trend has emerged in the
collection of market information. More

Role of Digital connection and consumer cooperation
In China and India, booming middle classes and fast-rising disposable incomes
have created a still-under-tapped consumer culture. Let’s not forget the lessons
being learned about the brand-building, power of digital connections and consumer
co-creation. Since the advent of the internet, sites that offer social interaction and
connectivity have been at the forefront of our digital revolution, reshaping the way
consumers expect to interact with each other and, ultimately, with brands.
Online tag-sale site e-Bay, for example was one of the first sites to teach us that
you can trust people online as well as you might trust a friendly neighbour. That
social interaction paved the way for Friendster and MySpace and You Tube, a social
networking tool that, in the past year, has empowered consumers to create their
own content and post it to a global audience. Anyone who doubts the real market
potential of such a platform only needs to check out October’s biggest business
headlines: Google purchased the site for $ 1.65 billion.
HSBC effort attempted a similar goal, to give consumers a forum for conversation.
At your pointofview.com, consumers in 76 countries can weigh in and give their
opinions on subjects including cloning, fashion, wind farms and video games.
Teenagers in Chinese cities surf the web for 5.1 hours a week, and the online
ad-market is booming—by more than 75% annually for the past three years,
according to Business Week, Mobile phones are among the most coveted pieces of
technology. And 17.5 million bloggers (and their 75 million readers), many of whom
fall within the coveted 18–25 age groups, are shaping consumer opinions in China
with more intensity than they do in the US.
The internet age has put advertisers and branding experts face-to-face with an
empowered consumer. And those consumers are happy to listen to our messages,
as long as we are willing to listen to them.

which helps in achieving uniformity and
consistency in the output. Standardisation
ensures the buyers that goods conform
to the predetermined standards of quality,
price and packaging and reduces the need
for inspection, testing and evaluation of
the products.
Grading is the process of
classification of products into different
groups, on the basis of some of its
important characteristics such as
quality, size, etc. Grading is particularly
necessary for products which are not
produced according to predetermined
specifications, such as in the case of
agricultural products, say wheat,
oranges, etc. Grading ensures that
goods belong to a particular quality and
helps in realising higher prices for high
quality output.

Packaging refers to designing and

and developing the label to be put on
the package. The label may vary from
a simple tag to complex graphics.
Packaging and labelling have
become so important in modern day
marketing that these are considered
as the pillars of marketing. Packaging
is important not only for protection of
the products but also serves as a
promotional tool. Sometimes, the
quality of the product is assessed by
the buyers form packaging. We have
seen that in the success of many of
the consumer brands in recent times
such as Lays or Uncle Chips potato
wafers Clinic Plus shampoos, and
Colgate Toothpaste, etc., packaging
has played an important role.

6. Branding: A very important decision
area for marketing of most consumer
products is whether to sell the product
in its generic name (name of the category
of the product, say Fan, Pen, etc.) or to
sell them in a brand name (such as
Pollar Fan or Rottomac Pen). Brand
name helps in creating product
differentiation, i.e., providing basis for
distinguishing the product of a firm
with that of the competitor, which in
turn, helps in building customer’s
loyality and in promoting its sale. The
important decision areas in respect of
branding include deciding the branding
strategy, say whether each product will
be given a separate brand name or the
same brand name will be extended to
all products of the company, say
Phillips bulbs, tubes and television or
Videocon washing machine, television,
and refrigerator. Selection of the brand
name plays an important role in the
success of a product.

affecting the success or failure of a
product in the market. The demand for
a product or service is related to its
price. Generally lower the price, higher
would be the demand for the product
and vice-versa. The marketers have
to properly analyse the factors
determining the price of a product and
take several crucial decisions in this
respect, including setting the pricing
objectives, determining the pricing
strategies, determining the price and
changing the prices.

marketer has to take several crucial,
decisions in respect of promotion of

physical movement of the product from
where it is produced to a place where it
is required by the customers for their
consumption or use. The important
decision areas under physical
distribution include managing
inventory (levels of stock of goods),
storage and warehousing and
transportation of goods from one place
to the other.

involves physical movement of goods
from one place to the other. As
generally the users of products,
particularly consumer products are
wide spread and geographically
separated from the place these are
produced, it is necessary to move them
to the place where it is needed for
consumption or use, For example, tea
produced in Assam has to be
transported not only within the state
but to other far off places like Tamil
Nadu, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir
and Haryana, Rajasthan, where it is
consumed.
A marketing firm has to analyse
its transportation needs after taking
into consideration various factors
such as nature of the product, cost
and location of target market and take
decisions in respect of mode of
transportation to be chosen and other
related aspects.

there is a time gap between the
production or procurement of goods
and their sale or use. It may be
because of irregular demand for the
products such as in the case of woollen
garments or Raincoats or there may
be irregular supply because of
seasonal production such as in the
case of agricultural products
(sugarcane, rice, wheat, cotton, etc.). In
order to maintain smooth flow of
products in the market, there is a need
for proper storage of the products.
Further, there is a need for storage of
adequate stock of goods to protect
against unavoidable delays in delivery
or to meet out contingencies in the
demand. In the process of marketing,
the function of storage is performed by
different
agencies
manufacturers, wholesalers and
retailers.

All marketing organisations operate
either to earn profit or pursue some
other goals such as community
service, improvement of quality of life
or promotion of a cause, say UNICEF
working for the welfare of children or
‘Helpage’ working for the cause of
senior citizens. Whether it is a
profit organisation or a non-profit
organisation, marketing plays
an important role in achieving its
objectives. It helps the individual
consumers in raising their standard
of living by making available the
products and services that satisfy their
needs and wants. It also plays a
significant role in the economic
development of a nation. The role of
marketing in different situations may
be described in brief as follows.

The modern concept of marketing plays
a significant role in achieving the
objectives of a firm. It emphasises that
customer satisfaction is the key to the
survival and growth of an organisation
in the contemporary competitive
marketing environment. By adopting
marketing orientation, an organisation
whether profit making or non-profit
making, can achieve its goals in the
most effective manner. It helps in
focusing the activities of an
organisation on the needs and wants
of the customers. For example, what
products or services will be marketed
by a firm will depend upon what do
its customers need. Thus, an analysis
of the needs of the customers shall be
undertaken in order to decide what to
produce and sell. The product will
then be designed according to the
needs of the potential buyers and be
made available through the outlets
convenient to customers and be priced
at a level which the target customers
can afford. In other words, marketing
as a business philosophy helps in
serving the customers by satisfying
their needs. It is a well known fact that
a satisfied customer is the most
valuable asset of any firm. Thus,
marketing plays a crucial role in the
survival and growth of a firm.

Marketing plays a significant role in the
development of an economy. It acts as
a catalyst in the economic development
of a country and helps in raising the
standards of living of the people.
Development of a nation can be
judged by the level of standard of living
of its people. Another important
criteria, which is related to the first
one, is the per capita income of an
average citizen of a country. On this
basis, an underdeveloped country may
be stated to be one which is
characterised by factors like poverty,
scarcity of goods and services,
predominance of agriculture, etc.
Marketing can play a significant
role in the economic development of a
nation. It can inspire people to
undertake new activities and to set up
enterprises for producing goods that
are needed by the customers.
Marketing can help in overcoming
obstacles posed by high prices due to
imbalances in the levels of production
and consumption. It can also ensure
smooth flow of goods through efficient
physical distribution arrangements.
In other words, marketing can help
in finding out right type of products
and services that a firm should
manufacture, the places where it
should make such products available
for sale, the price at which the
products should be sold and the
channels that should be used for
moving the products to the ultimate
place of consumption or use. This
linkage between the business and
consumption centres, accelerates the
economic activity leading to higher
incomes, more consumption and
increased savings and investment.

As stated in an earlier section, the
process of marketing involves creating
a market offering, to satisfy the needs
and wants of the present and potential
buyers. The real question is how to
create a market offering. Let us say a
profitable business opportunity is
seen by some firm in the field of
producing soft drinks. To develop and
market a new brand of soft drinks, a
number of important decisions will
have to be taken for example whether
to go for any collaboration with a
foreign manufacturer of soft drinks,
whether to produce for the local
market or for a wider market, what will
be the features of the new product,
and so on.
There are large number of factors
affecting marketing decisions. These
can broadly be divided into two
categories: (i) controllable factors, and
(ii) non-controllable factors. Controllable
factors are those factors which can be
influenced at the level of the firm. In
the previous illustration, for example,
whether the drink will be packed in
glass bottles or plastic cans; what will
be the name (brand name) of the drink;
at what price it will be sold, (at par
with the price at which other
competitive brands are sold or below
it or above it); what distribution
network will be used to make the
product available (e.g., hotels,
restaurants, groceries shops, kiosks
selling cigarette, paan, etc.) to the
buyers whether the new soft drink will

magazine or on radio or television; or

newspaper or a national daily; whether

English daily, etc. is decided at the
level of marketing manager of the firm.
However, there are certain other
factors which affect the decision but
are not controllable at the firm’s level.
These are called environmental
variables. For example, the political
factors such as the government policy
on whether to allow any technical or
financial collaboration in the area of
soft drinks, production or economic
factors such as rate of inflation
prevailing in a given period or a credit
policy of the central bank affecting the
total availability of money in the

market, all of which affect the sale of
a particular product but can not be
controlled or influenced by the
decisions at the level of a firm. To be
successful, the decisions regarding
‘controllable factors’ are to be taken
keeping the environmental variables
into consideration.
The controllable variables become
marketing tools, which are constantly
shaped and reshaped by marketing
managers, to achieve marketing
success. For example, a firm can
reshape a market offering by bringing
in a change in any of the variable under
its own control, say introducing a
change in the price or promotion offer
or product features or channel used to
make the product available to buyers.
Thus, from a number of alternatives
available a firm chooses a particular
combination to develop a market
offering. The combination of variables
chosen by a firm to prepare its market
offering is also called marketing mix.
Thus, marketing mix is described as the
set of marketing tools that a firm uses
to pursue its marketing objectives in a
target market.

of food products (Amul milk, ghee,

The concept of product relates to
not only the physical product as
mentioned in the above examples but
also the benefits offered by it from
customer’s view point (for example
toothpaste is bought for whitening
teeth, strengthening gums, etc.). The
concept of product also include the
extended product or what is offered
to the customers by way of after sales
services, handling complaints,
availability of spare parts etc.
These aspects are very important,
particularly in the marketing of
consumer durable products (like
Automobiles, Refrigerators, etc.). The
important product decisions include
deciding about the features, quality,
packaging, labelling and branding of
the products.

customers have to pay to obtain the

products, level of price affects the level
of their demand. The marketers have
not only to decide about the objectives
of price setting but to analyse the
factors determining the price and fix
a price for the firm’s products.
Decisions have also to be taken in
respect of discounts to customers,
traders and credit terms, etc. so that
customers perceive the price to be in
line with the value of the product.

include activities that make firm’s
products available to the target
customers. Important decision areas in
this respect include selection of dealers
or intermediaries to reach the
customers, providing support to the
intermediaries (by way of discounts,
promotional campaigns, etc.). The
intermediaries in turn keep inventory
of the firm’s products, demonstrate
them to potential buyers, negotiate
price with buyers, close sales and also
service the products after the sale. The
other decision areas relate to managing
inventory, storage and warehousing
and transportation of goods from the
place it is produced to the place it is
required by the buyers.

and services include activities that
communicate availability, features,

target customers and persuade

organisations, undertake various
promotional activities and spend
substantial amount of money on the
promotion of their goods through
using number of tools such as
advertising, personal selling and sales
promotion techniques (like price
discounts, free samples, etc.). A large
number of decisions are to be taken
in each of the area specified above. For
example, in the respect of advertising
it is important to decide about the
message, the media to be used
(example, print-media–newspaper,

magazines, etc. the objections of
customers, etc.).
The success of a market offer will
depend on how well these ingredients
are mixed to create superior value for
the customers and simultaneously
achieve their sale and profit objectives.
Let us say a firm would like to achieve
necessary volume of sale at a cost that
will permit a desired level of profit. But
so many alternative mixes can be
adopted by a firm to achieve this
objectives. The issue before a firm then
is to decide what would be the most
effective combination of elements to
achieve the given objectives.

In common parlance, the word
‘product’, is used to refer only to the
physical or tangible attributes of a
product. For example, we say we have
bought a car or a pen or a Cell phone
or a tractor.
Our decision to buy a product is
not only affected by its physical
qualities, but also by certain non-
tangible and psychological factors,
e.g., brand name, reputation,
guaranty, packaging etc. Let us say,
when a person buys a car, he/she is
not just buying a few nuts and bolts,
an engine, four wheels and so on.
Rather he/she is buying a means of
transport, a status symbol, guarantees
and warranties accompanying the
product, image of the company and
many other such attributes. Thus, in
marketing, product is a mixture of
tangible and intangible attributes,
which are capable of being exchanged
for a value, with ability to satisfy
customer needs. Besides physical
objects, we also include services,
ideas, persons, and places in the

PepsiCo on Monday said it will launch new healthier products next year and
focus on growth in emerging markets, a continuation of the strategy that helped the
world’s No. 2 beverage company stay profitable ever as sales growth of its flagship
soft drinks has slowed.
PepsiCo’s new CEO Indra Nooyi, who took the reins on October 1, also said the
company was on track to meet its annual target of volume and revenue growth in
the mid-single digits and earnings per share growth in the low double digits.
PepsiCo evolved from being known mostly for selling soda and salty snacks into
a $33-billion food company that has embraced the push into healthier options like
Tropicana juice, Aquafina water and whole grain Quaker Oats Cereals.
The company said that moving forward, its capital expenditure as a percentage
of sales would increase, and that most of the increased spending will go to expansion
in developing and emerging markets and adding manufacturing capacity for Gatorade
and other non-carbonated drinks.

concept of product. Thus, product may
be defined as anything that can be
offered to a market to satisfy a want
or need. It is offered for attention,
acquisition, use or consumption.
From the customer’s point of view,
a product is a bundle of utilities, which
is purchased because of its capability
to provide satisfaction of certain need.
A buyer buys a product or service for
what it does for her or the benefit it
provides to her. There can be three
types of benefits a customer may seek
to satisfy from the purchase of a
product, viz., (i) functional benefits, (ii)
psychological benefits, and (iii) social
benefits. For example, the purchase of
a motorcycle provides functional utility
of transportation, but at the same time
satisfies the need for prestige and
esteem and provides social benefit by
the way of acceptance from a group,
by riding a motorbike. Thus, all these
aspects should be considered while
planning for a product.
It is customer for companies to
review the progress of their present
products and constantly look for
opportunities of diversifying into never
areas. (see box on PepsiCo.)

products have low unit-value and are
bought in small qualities. Some of the
important characteristics of such
products are:

as these generally come under the
category of essential products;
(c) These products have small unit of
purchase and low prices. For
example the eggs are sold at Rs.
28 per dozen and the customers
purchase them in small numbers;
(f) Sales promotion schemes or short-

an important role in the marketing
of such products.

have, therefore, to heavily advertise
for these products; and
of shopping products are clothes,
shoes, jewellery, furniture, radio,

characteristics of shopping products
are as below:
(a) The shopping products are
generally of durable nature, i.e.,
they normally survive many uses;

(b) The unit price as well as profit
margin of shopping products is
generally high;
(c) As these products have high unit
price, customers compare the
products of different companies
before making selection;
(d) Purchases of shopping products
are generally pre-planned and
there is little degree of impulse
buying in these products; and
(e) Retailers generally play an
important role in the sale of
shopping products as lot of
persuasive effort is needed to
convince the buyers to purchase
them.

Speciality Products: Speciality
products are those consumer goods
which have certain special features
because of which people make special
efforts in their purchase. These
products are such, which have
reached a brand loyalty of the highest
order, with a significant number of
buyers. The buyers are willing to spend
a lot of time and efforts on the purchase
of such products. For example, if there
is a rare collection of artwork or of
antiques, some people may be willing
to spend a lot of shopping effort and
travel long distance to buy such
products. In our day-to-day life, we see
people going to a particular hair-
cutting saloon or restaurant, or a tailor.
The demand for these goods is relatively
inelastic, i.e., even if the price is
increased, the demand does not come
down. Some of the important
characteristics of the speciality
products may be summed up as
follows:
(a) The demand for speciality products
is limited as relatively small
number of people buy these
products;
(b) These products are generally costly
and their unit price is very high;
Speciality Products

(c) These products are available for
sale at few places as the number
of customers is small and are
willing to take extra efforts in the
purchase of these products;
(d) An aggressive promotion is required
for the sale of speciality products,
in order to inform people about
their availability, features, etc.; and
(e) After sales services are very
important for many of the
speciality products.

cargo which account for almost 35-40% of private firm’s turnover) at around Rs
1,500 crore. In value terms, while Speed Post is the leader, Blue Dart is a close
second with a 20% market share, followed by DTDC with a 11.91% share and First
Flight with a 10.89% share.
“This has been possible because of our competitive pricing. We are offering the
same services as other private couriers do, with the same efficiency but at half the
rates”, added Mr. Samuel. In fact, Speed Post claims that its volumes have increased
by almost 30-40% after the introduction of the One India One Rate scheme.
Express companies are hopeful that the market is going to grow further with
the setting up of SEZs and greater economic activity in the country fuelled by the
increasing throughput from the manufacturing sector.

Services: The durable and non-
durable goods are tangible in the
sense that these have a physical
existence and can be seen and
touched. Services are intangible in
form. By services we mean those
activities, benefits or satisfactions,
which are offered for sale, e.g., dry
cleaning, watch repairs, hair cutting,
postal services, services offered by a
doctor, an architect and a lawyer. Some
of the distinguishing characteristics of
services are as follows:
(a) By their very nature, services are
intangible, i.e., we can not see, feel
or touch them;
(b) A service is inseparable from its
source. That means we cannot
separate the service from the
person providing the service;
(c) The services cannot be stored.
They are highly perishable. For
example, if a tailor does not work
for one week, the services he would
have provided during such period
go waste; and
(d) Services are highly variable as their
type and quality depends on the
person providing them. That is
why, there is a difference in the
extent of satisfaction we get from
the services provided by different
people.

Industrial products are those
products, which are used as inputs
in producing other products. The
examples of such products are raw
materials, engines, lubricants,
machines, tools, etc. In other words,
industrial products are meant for non-
personal and business use for
producing other products.
The market for industrial products
consists of manufacturers, transport
agencies, banks and insurance
companies, mining companies and

One of the most important decisions
that a marketer has to take in the area
of ‘product’ is in respect of branding.
He has to decide whether the firm’s
products will be marketed under a
brand name or a generic name.
2015-16(21/01/2015)
BUSINESS STUDIES
Generic name refers to the name of the
whole class of the product. For
example, a book, a wristwatch, tyre,
camera, toilet soap, etc. We know that
a camera is a lens surrounded by
plastic or steel from all sides and having
certain other features such as a flash
gun and so on. Similarly book is a
bunch of papers, which are in a bound
form, on which some useful information
about a subject is printed. Thus, all
products having these characteristics
would be called by the generic name
such as camera or book.
If products were sold by generic
names, it would be very difficult for the
marketers to distinguish their products
from that of their competitors. Thus,
most marketers give a name to their
product, which helps in identifying and
distinguishing their products from the
competitors’ products. This process of
giving a name or a sign or a symbol etc.,
to a product is called branding. The
various terms relating to branding are
as follows:
1. Brand:

Brand: A brand is a name, term,

common brands are Bata, Lifebuoy,
Dunlop, Hot Shot, and Parker. Brand

Branding is creating a corporate brand identity for consumer, and getting
that brand identity imprinted on the minds of consumer, and this requires
brand positioning and brand management.
A brand today is an entity (product. service, company, person, technology,
etc.), that offers a set of value exchange measures between what the owner/
market seeks and the price he is willing to pay for.
It has always seemed to me that your brand is formed primarily, not by what
your company says about itself, but what the company does.

brand that is given legal protection is
called trademark. The protection is
given against its use by other firms.
Thus the firm, which got its brand
registered, gets the exclusive right for
its use. In that case, no other firm can
use such name or mark in the country.
Though branding adds to the cost
e.g., to the cost of packaging, labelling,
legal protection, and promotion, it
provides several advantages to the
sellers as well as the consumers.

Product
Differentiation: Branding helps a
firm in distinguishing its product
from that of its competitors. This
enables the firm to secure and
control the market for its products.
(ii) Helps in Advertising and Display
Programmes: A brand aids a firm
in its advertising and display
programmes. Without a brand
name, the advertiser can only
create awareness for the generic
product and can never be sure of
the sale for his product.
(iii) Differential Pricing: Branding
enables a firm to charge different
price for its products than that
charged by its competitors. This is
possible because if customers like
a brand and become habitual of
it, they do not mind paying a little
higher for it.
(iv) Ease in Introduction of New
Product: If a new product is
introduced under a known brand,
it enjoys the reflected glory of the
brand and is likely to get off to an
excellent start. Thus, many
companies with established brand
names decide to introduce new
products in the same name. For
example, Food Specialties Ltd. had
a successful brand Maggie
(Noodles), it extended this name to
many of its new products
introduced such as Tomato
Ketchup, Soups, etc. Similarly
Samsung extended the brand
name of its Television to Washing
Machines and other durable
products, like Microwave oven.

Helps in Product Identification:
Branding helps the customers in
identifying the products. For
example, if a person is satisfied
with a particular brand of a
product, say tea leaves or detergent
soap, he need not make a close
inspection every time, he has to
buy that product. Thus, branding
greatly facilitates repeat purchase
of the products.
(ii) Ensures Quality: Branding ensures
a particular level of quality of the
product.  Thus, whenever there is
any deviation in the quality, the
customers can have recourse to the
manufacturer or the marketer. This
builds up confidence of the
customers and helps in increasing
his level of satisfaction.
(iii) Status Symbol: Some brands
become status symbols because of
their quality. The consumers of
those brands of products feel proud
of using them and adds to the level
of satisfaction of the customers.

Choosing the right brand name is not
an easy decision. What makes this
decision important is the fact that once a
brand name is chosen and the product
is launched in the market, changing the
brand name is very difficult. So, getting
it right the first time is very essential.
Following
considerations, which should be kept
in mind while choosing a brand name.
(i) The brand name should be short,
easy to pronounce, spell,
recognise and remember e.g.,
Ponds, VIP, Rin, Vim, etc.
A brand should suggest the
product’s benefits and qualities.
It should be appropriate to the
product’s function. e.g., Rasika,
Genteel, Promise, My Fair Lady
and Boost.
(iii) A brand name should be
distinctive e.g., Liril, Sprit, Safari,
Zodiac.
The brand name should be
adaptable to packing or labelling
requirements,
different
advertising media and to different
languages.
The brand name should be
sufficiently
versatile
accommodate new products,
which are added to the product
line e.g., Maggie, Colgate.
It should be capable of being
registered and protected legally.

important
developments affecting the business
world in recent years has been in the
area of packaging. Many products,
which we thought could never lend
themselves to packing because of their
nature, have been successfully packed
e.g., Pulses, Ghee, Milk, Salt, Cold
Drinks, etc. Packaging refers to the act
of designing and producing the
container or wrapper of a product.
Packaging plays a very important role
in the marketing success or failure of
many products, particularly the
consumer non-durable products. In
fact if one makes an analysis of the
reasons for the success of some of the
successful products in the recent past,
it can be noted that packaging has
played its due role. For example, it was
one of the important factors in the
success of products like Maggie’s

Importance of Packaging
Packaging has acquired great
significance in the marketing of goods
and services, because of following
reasons:
Rising Standards of Health and
Sanitation: Because of the
increasing standards of living in
the country, more and more people
have started purchasing packed
goods
chances
adulteration in such goods are
minimised.
(ii) Self Service Outlets: The self-service
retail outlets are becoming very
popular, particularly in major cities
and towns. Because of this, some
of the traditional role assigned to
personal selling in respect of
promotion has gone to packaging.
(iii) Innovational Opportunity: Some of
the recent developments in the area
of packaging have completely
changed the marketing scene in
the country. For example, milk can
now be stored for 4-5 days without
refrigeration in the recently
developed packing materials.
Similarly,
pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, etc.,
lots of new innovations have come
in respect of packaging. As a
result, the scope for the marketing
of such products has increased.
(iv) Product Differentiation: Packaging is
one of the very important means of
creating product differentiation.
The colour, size, material etc., of
package makes real difference in
the perception of customers about
the quality of the product. For
example, by looking at the
package of a product say Paint or
Hair Oil, one can make some
guess about quality of the product
contained in it.

As stated above, packaging performs

important functions are as follows:
Product Identification: Packaging
greatly helps in identification of the
products. For example, Colgate in
red colour, or Ponds cream jar can
be easily identified by its package.
(ii) Product Protection: Packaging
protects the contents of a product
2015-16(21/01/2015)
MARKETING
from spoilage, breakage, leakage,
pilferage, damage, climatic effect, etc.
This kind of protection is required
during storing, distribution and
transportation of the product.
(iii) Facilitating Use of the Product: The
size and shape of the package
should be such that it should be
convenient to open, handle and use
for the consumers. Cosmetics,
medicines and tubes of toothpastes
are good examples of this.
(iv) Product Promotion: Packaging is
also used for promotion purposes.
A startling colour scheme,
photograph or typeface may be
used to attract attention of the
people at the point of purchase.
Sometimes it may work even better
than advertising. In self-service
stores, this role of packaging
becomes all the more important.

A simple looking but important task
in the marketing of goods relates to
designing the label to be put on the
package. The label may vary from a
simple tag attached to the product
(such as in case of local unbranded
products like sugar, wheat, pulses,
etc.) indicating some information
about the quality or price, to complex
graphics that are part of the package,
like the ones on branded products (say
the graphic of Boat and Patwar on the
package of a popular brand of After
Shave Lotion or of a lady offering a pen
to solicit the views of the users, on the
label of a detergent powder). Lables are
useful in providing detailed information
about the product, its contents,
method of use, etc. The various
functions performed by a label are as

Tobacco is Injurious to Health’. Such
information is required on processed
foods, drugs and tobacco products. In
case of hazardous or poisonous

important functions relating to
communicating with the potential
buyers and promoting the sale of the
products.

When a product is bought, some money
is paid for it. This money represent the
sum of values that consumers
exchange for the benefit of having or
using the prdocut and is referred to as
the price of the product. Similarly,
money paid for the services such as fare
for the transport service, premium for
an insurance policy, and fee to a doctor
for his medical advise represent the
price of these services. Price may
therefore be defined as the amount of
money paid by a buyer (or received by
a seller) in consideration of the
purchase of a product or a service.
Pricing occupies an important
place in the marketing of goods and
services by a firm. No product can be
launched without a price tag or at least
some guidelines for pricing. Pricing is
often used as a regulator of the
demand of a product. Generally, if the
price of a product is increased, its
demand comes down, and vice-versa.
Pricing is considered to be an
effective competitive weapon. In the
conditions of perfect competition,
most of the firms compete with each
other on the basis of this factor. It is
also the single most important factor
affecting the revenue and profits of a
firm. Thus, most marketing firms give
high importance to the fixation of price
for their products and services.

product or service is its cost. This
includes the cost of producing,
distributing and selling the product.
The cost sets the minimum level or the
floor price at which the product may
be sold. Generally all marketing firms
strive to cover all their costs, at least
in the long run. In addition, they aim
at earning a margin of profit over and
above the costs. In certain circumstance,
for example, at the time of introducing
a new product or while entering a new
market, the products may be sold at
a price, which does not cover all the
costs. But in the long run, a firm
cannot survive unless at least all its
costs are covered.
There are broadly three types of
costs: viz., Fixed Costs, Variable Costs
and Semi Variable Costs. Fixed costs
are those costs, which do not vary with
the level of activity of a firm say with
the volume of production or sale. For
example, rent of a building or salary
2015-16(21/01/2015)
BUSINESS STUDIES
of a sales manager remains the same
whether 1000 units or 10 units are
produced in a week.
Those costs which vary in direct
proportion with the level of activity are
called variable costs. For example, the
costs of raw material, labour and power
are directly related with the quantity
of goods produced. Let us say, if the
cost of wood for manufacturing one
chair comes to Rs.100 the cost of wood
for 10 chairs would be Rs. 1000.
Obviously, there will be no cost of wood
if no chair is produced.
Semi variable costs are those costs
which vary with the level of activity
but not in direct proportion with it.
For example, compensation of a sales
person may include a fixed salary of
say Rs. 10,000 plus a commission of
5 per cent on sales. With an increase
in the volume of sales, the total
compensation will increase but not in
direct proportion with the change in
the volume of sale.
Total Costs are the sum total of the
fixed, variable and semi-variable costs
for the specific level of activity, say
volume of sales or quantity produced.

2. The Utility and Demand: While the
product costs set the lower limits of
the price, the utility provided by the
product and the intensity of demand
of the buyer sets the upper limit of
price, which a buyer would be
prepared to pay. In fact the price must
reflect the interest of both the parties
to the transaction—the buyer and the
seller. The buyer may be ready to pay
up to the point where the utility from
the product is at least equal to the
sacrifice made in terms of the price
paid. The seller would, however, try to
at least cover the costs. According to
the law of demand, consumers usually
purchase more units at a low price than
at a high price.
The price of a product is affected
by the elasticity of demand of the
product. The demand is said to be
elastic if a relatively small change in
price results in large change in the
quantity demanded. Here numerically,
the price elasticity is greater than one.
In the case of inelastic demand, the
total revenue increases when the price
is increased and goes down when the
price is reduced. If the demand of a
product is inelastic, the firm is in a
better position to fix higher prices.

The price will tend to reach the upper
limit in case there is lesser degree of
competition while under conditions of
free competition, the price will tend to
be set at the lowest level.
Competitors’ prices and their
anticipated reactions must be
considered before fixing the price of a
product. Not only the price but the
quality and the features of the
competitive products must be examined
carefully, before fixing the price.

commodities. Government can declare
a product as essential product and
regulate its price. For example, the cost
of a drug manufactured by a company
having monopoly in the production of
the same come to Rs 20 per strip of ten
and the buyer is prepared to pay any
amount for it, say Rs 200. In the
absence of any competitor, the seller
may be tempted to extort the maximum
amount
Rs 200 for the drug and intervene to
regulate the price. Usually in such a
case, the Government does not allow
the firms to charge such a high price
and intervene to regulate the price of
the drug. This can be done by the
Government by declaring the drug as
essential commodity and regulating its
price. (see box)

Pricing Objectives: Pricing
objectives are another important factor
affecting the fixation of the price of a
product or a service. Generally the
objective is stated to be maximise the
profits. But there is a difference in
maximising profit in the short run and
in the long run. If the firm decides to
maximise profits in the short run, it
would tend to charge maximum price
for its products. But if it is to maximise
its total profit in the long run, it would
opt for a lower per unit price so that it
can capture larger share of the market
and earn greater profits through
increased sales.
Apart from profit maximisation, the
pricing objectives of a firm may include:
(a) Obtaining Market Share Leadership:
If a firms objective is to obtain larger
share of the market; it will keep the
price of its products at lower levels
so that greater number of people are
attracted to purchase the products;
(b) Surviving in a Competitive Market:
If a firm is facing difficulties in
surviving in the market because of
intense competition or introduction
of a more efficient substitute by
a competitor, it may resort to

Drug price watchdog National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has decided
to invoke the ‘public interest’ clause in the drugs law more often to pressure
companies to reduce prices of medicines that go up more than 20% in a year.
The pricing body has also decided to limit its communication with companies
to just one reminder asking them to respond to the show-cause notice on why
the drug should not be recommended for price control, sources told ET.
NPPA has now started scrutinising the fluctuations in the price-to-retailer of
48,600 formulation packs every month. Every month, two to three formulations are
likely to get caught on an average.
So far, NPPA has recommended 45 cases of alleged abnormal price increase to
the Chemicals Ministry for appropriate action, on which the ministry has sent notices
to 11 companies asking them to reduce prices or face price control.

The fourth important element of
marketing mix is the physical
distribution of products and services.
It is concerned with making the goods
and services available at the right
place, so that people can purchase the
same. There are two important
decisions relating to this aspect—one
regarding physical movement of goods
from producers to consumers or users
and two, regarding the channels
or using intermediaries in the
distribution process. These are
described as follows:
Channels of Distribution
Channels of Distribution

Channels of Distribution
In case of large number of consumer
products, the potential buyers are
scattered over a wide geographical area.
In order to contact these people
efficiently and effectively, it is important
to take the help of number of
intermediaries as contacting them
directly may not be cost effective and
may be difficult even otherwise. For
example, a manufacturer of detergent
powder in Gujarat would find it very
difficult to directly approach customers,
say in Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram,
Bhuvaneshwar, Hyderabad Srinagar
and other far off places. Therefore, he/
she would supply a large quantity of
his/her product to a big merchant, say
in Hyderabad. This big merchant would
then supply detergent powder to
relatively small sellers in various towns
of Hyderabad. These sellers would, in
turn, resell the goods to customers. In
this manner, goods are distributed from
the place of production to the place of
consumption. These people, institutions,
merchants, and functionaries, who take
part in the distribution function, are
called ‘Channels of Distribution’.
(see figure on channels)
Channels of Distribution are set of
firms and individuals that take title,
or assist in transferring title, to
particular goods or services as it
moves from the producers to the
consumers. In other words, channel
refers to a team of merchants, agents,
2015-16(21/01/2015)
MARKETING
and business institutions that
combine physical movement and title
movement of products to reach specific
destinations.
Mostly goods and services are
distributed through a network of
marketing channels. For example we
buy merchandise of our need such as
salt, bulb, tea, sugar, soap, paper,
books, flour, etc., from retail sellers.
The channels bring economy of
effort. This can be better understood
with the help of an example. Let us
say you have to buy four things, viz.,
Sugar, Bulb, Coffee and Ink. Most
probably you would walk into a
General Merchant’s Shop and buy all
the articles form one place. Imagine
what would happen if there were no
middlemen or general merchants
available. In that case you would have
to buy directly from the manufacturers
of these products. You will have to
make four contacts, each with the
producer of Sugar, Bulb, Coffee and
Ink. Compared to this, there was only
one contact when all the things were
bought from the same general
merchant. Now let us assume that
there are four customers needing the
same four articles. In all sixteen
contacts would have to be made. In
case middleman are used, as shown
in the part II of the figure, only eight
contacts could be needed. Thus, use
of middlemen brings economy of effort.
This situation is illustrated in the
preceeding figure.
Apart from the economy of effort,
middlemen help to cover large
geographical area and bring efficiency
in distribution, including transportation,
storage and negotiation. They bring
convenience to customers as they
make various items available at one
store and also serve as authentic
source of market information as they
are in direct contact with the customer.

involving any intermediary. This is
also called zero level channel. A
straight and direct relationship is
established between the manufacturer
and the customer. For example, when
a manufacturer sells his goods
through his own retail outlets (e.g.,
Mc Donald, Bata); it is referred to as
direct channel. Similarly, mail order
selling, internet selling and selling
through own sales force, (e.g., Eureka

Choice of appropriate channel of
distribution is a very important
marketing decision, which affects the
performance of an organisation.
Whether an organisation will adopt
direct marketing channels or long

intermediaries is a strategic decision.
The choice of channels depends on
various factors, which are discussed

considerations in deciding the

is an industrial or a consumer product,
whether it is a perishable or a non-
perishable product, what is the unit
value of the product and the degree of
complexity of the product.
Industrial products are usually
technical, made to order and
expensive products purchased by few
buyers. These products require short
channels i.e., direct channel or
involving few middlemen.
Consumer products, on the other
hand, are usually standardised, less
expensive, less bulky, non-technical
and frequently bought products.
These can be better distributed by long
network of channels, involving many
middlemen. Perishable products like
fruits, vegetables, and dairy products
are best sold through short channels,
while non-perishable products like
toiletry
products
(e.g.,
soap,
toothpaste, hair oil etc.), groceries
(vegetable oil, tea leaf etc.), fabrics
require longer channels to reach wide
spread consumers.
If the unit value of a product is low
as in case of most convenience
products, long channels are preferred
while in case of high value products,
shorter channels may be used.
Similarly, in case of complex products
requiring technical details as in case
of most industrial or engineering
products, short channels are preferred
but if the product is a non-complex
one, it is sold through long channels,
involving number of intermediaries.

It’s the cheap and cheerful concept that has worked all over the world. Now, its

Though the concept, relatively new to the Indian market, retailers are trying to
aggressively foray region’s low-cost daily-use retail segment. Idea is to enable a
customer buy a range of products its for or less than Rs 99. This being the template,
retailers have introduced nations to suit there business models. The store range of
largely food, healthcare and products.
Home stores has gone a step further to introduce some interesting modifications
to the basic idea of a dollar-and-dime store. “We believe that pricing all products at
a flat Rs 99 will be a rigid approach. We have introduced four different price slabs to
make it more attractive and reach a broader customer profile.
Homemaker’s group has modified the idea even further by introducing bargain
pricing on its products with the help of a two-digit price band. So customers visiting
the Homemakers shops will not only get products between Rs 10 and Rs 99, they
will also have more price positioning options.

fixed assets say for starting own retail
outlets or engaging large number of
sales force. Indirect selling through
intermediary does not involve
deployment of huge funds on these
aspects. Thus, if the firm has plenty of
funds it may go for direct distribution.
If spare funds are not available, it may
go for indirect channels.
Similarly if the management want
to have greater control on the channel
members, short channels are used but
if the management do not want more
control over the middlemen, it can go
in for longer channel or large number
of intermediaries.

channel selected by competitors in the

selected a particular channel say
Chemist shops for the sale of toiletry
products like hair oil, the other firm
may also like to select the similar
channel. In some cases producers may
want to avoid the channels used by
competitors. For example if other
cosmetic producers have chosen big
retail stores for the sale of their
products, a particular firm may like to
adopt door to door selling. Thus, it will
depend upon the policy of the firm –
whether it wants to go with the
competitors or be different from them.
The changing global marketing
environment has lead to adoption of
newer channels. (see box)

If the buyers are concentrated in a
small place, short channels may be
used but if the buyers are widely

Once goods are manufactured,

a detergent bar, wants to purchase the

he/she may purchase some of the
alternative brand available. This way a
sure sale is lost because goods were not
available at the place where the
customer wanted to purchase. Thus, it
is an important responsibility of the
marketers to make the product
physically available at a place where
the customers would like them to buy.
The physical handling and movement
of goods from place of production to
the place of distribution is referred to
as physical distribution, which is a very
important element of marketing mix.
Physical distribution covers all the
activities required to physically move
goods from manufacturers to the
customers. Important activities involved
in the physical distribution include
transportation, warehousing, material
handling, and inventory control. These
activities constitute major components
of physical distribution.

good physical distribution system
should provide for an accurate and
speedy processing of orders, in the
absence of which goods would reach
the customers late or in wrong quantity
or specifications. This would result in
customer dissatisfaction, with the
danger of loss of business and goodwill.

to the act of storing and assorting
products in order to create time utility
in them. The basic purpose of
warehousing activities is to arrange
placement of goods and provide
facilities to store them. The need for
warehousing arises because there may
be difference between the time a
product is produced and the time it is
required for consumption. Generally
the efficiency of a firm in serving its
customers will depend on where these
warehouses are located and where are
these to be delivered.
Generally larger the number of
warehouses a firm has, lesser would
be the time taken in serving customers
at different locations but greater would
be the cost of warehousing and vice-
versa. Thus the firm has to strike a
balance between the cost of
warehousing and the level of customer
service.

storage (such as agricultural products)
the warehouses are located near
production sites. This helps in

Nothing sways an Indian buyer’s choice more than a word of reassurance from
the people he knows. Now even high octane media blitz. A global online survey
conducted by ACNielsen puts word of mouth communication and referencing as
the biggest influence than conventional advertising on consumers in their buying
decisions. In big ticket purchases like cars, mobile phones and home loans, the
study says that almost 50% of consumers in India rely on the references from
their friends and relatives while making their decisions.
The story is different in developed economies. Take the case of automobiles.
In markets like the US, Canada and Japan more people are influenced by
conventional advertising by automobile companies, in developing markets like
India, Malaysia and Thailand it’s the neighbour or the colleague who tips the
scales one way or the other. “In case of luxury goods, the psyche of Indians has
always been different. Buying a car is a family decision, so it is only natural that
all the members of the family will talk to all the other users of a similar products,
who they know”, General Motors India director P Balendran said:
“No wonder, large automakers in India spend as much on customer
satisfaction as advertising, and recognitions like the JD Power Customer
Satisfaction awards taken so seriously.”
When the whole world is going crazy with Internet and mobile marketing, it
is interesting that for Indians it’s still conventional advertising and word of mouth
campaigns that sways their choices. Unlike in the West, Indians come from a very
closely-knit society where people get influenced by their peers, relatives and local
celebrities. People are more than willing to accept a brand if it’s endorsed by their
favourite superstar or is recommended by their close associates,” AC Nielsen (south
Asia) ED Sarang Panchal says:
“However, in markets like the US, previous experience with the products is the
strongest influencer overall and particularly when it came to buying cars (49%),
choosing a banks (46%), mobile phone (39%) and loans (35%). World of mouth is a
priority while buying weight loss products and mobile phones.”

of capital would be tied up in the stock.
Thus, a balance is to be maintained in
respect of the cost and customer
satisfaction. With advancements in
computers and information technology
the need for keeping higher inventory
is reducing and the new concept of Just-
in-Time-Inventory decision is becoming
popular in an increasing number of
companies.
The decision regarding level of
inventory involves prediction about
the demand for the product. A correct
estimate of the demand helps to hold
inventory and cost level down to a
minimum. This not only helps the firm
in terms of the cash flows but also in
terms of its ability to maintain
production at a consistent level.
The major factors determining
inventory levels include:
(a) firm’s policy regarding the level of
customer service to be offered.
Higher the level of service greater
will be the need to keep more
inventories;
(b) degree of accuracy of the sales
forecasts. In case more accurate
estimates are available, the need
for keeping very high level of
inventory can be minimised;
(c) responsiveness of the distribution
system i.e., ability of the system
to transmit inventory needs back
to the factory and get products in
the market. In case the time
required to respond to the
additional demand for the products
is high there is a need to maintain
higher inventory. But if the
additional demand can be met in
less time, the need for inventory
will also be low; and
(d) cost of inventory, which includes
holding cost such as cost of
warehousing, tied up capital, etc
and the manufacturing cost.

Advertising is perhaps the most
commonly used tool of promotion.
It is an impersonal form of
communication, which is paid for by
the marketers (sponsors) to promote
some goods or service. The most
common modes of advertising are
‘newspapers’, ‘magazines’, ‘television’,

(ii) Impersonality: There is no direct

prospect and the advertiser. It is
therefore, referred to as impersonal
method of promotion. Advertising
creates a monologue and not a

Advertising, as a medium of
communication, has the following
merits:
Mass Reach: Advertising is a
medium through which a large
number of people can be reached
over a vast geographical area. For
example, an advertisement
message placed in a national daily
reaches lakhs of its subscribers.
(ii) Enhancing Customer Satisfaction
and Confidence: Advertising
creates confidence amongst
prospective buyers as they feel
more comfortable and assured
about the product quality and
hence feel more satisfied.
(iii) Expressiveness:
developments in art, computer
designs, and graphics, advertising
has developed into one of the most
forceful medium of communication.
With the special effects that can
be created, even simple products
and messages can look very
attractive.
(iv) Economy: Advertising is a very
economical mode of communication
if large number of people are to be
reached. Because of its wide reach,
the overall cost of advertising
gets spread over numerous
communication links established.
As a result the per-unit cost of
reach comes low.

Less Forceful: Advertising is an

It is less forceful than the personal
selling as there is no compulsion
on the prospects to pay attention
to the message.
(ii) Lack of Feedback: The evaluation
of the effectiveness of advertising
message is very difficult as there
is no immediate and accurate
feedback mechanism of the
message that is delivered.
(iii) Inflexibility: Advertising is less
flexible as the message is
standardised and is not tailor
made to the requirements of the
different customer groups.
(iv) Low Effectiveness: As the volume
of advertising is getting more and
more expanded it is becoming
difficult to make advertising
messages heard by the target
prospects. This is affecting the
effectiveness of advertising.

In the proceeding sections, you have
noted the merits and limitations of
advertising. Though advertising is one
of the most frequently used medium
of promotion of goods and services,
it attracts lot of criticism. The
opponents of advertising say that the
expenditure on advertising is a social
waste as it adds to the cost, multiplies
the needs of people and undermines
social values. The proponents,
however, argue that advertising is
very useful as it increases the reach,
brings the pay unit cost of production
down and adds to the growth of the
economy. It is therefore, important to
examine the major criticisms against
advertising and see the extent to
which these are true. This is taken

prices. An advertisement on TV, for a
few seconds, for example, costs the
marketers several lakhs of rupees.
Similarly an advertisement in print
media say in a newspaper or a
magazine costs the marketers a large
amount of money. The money spent
adds to the cost, which in an
important factor in fixation of the price
of a product.
True, advertisement of a product
costs lot of money but it helps to
increase the demand for the product
as large number of potential buyers
come to know about the availability
of the products, its features etc. and
are persuaded to buy it. The increased
demand leads to higher production,
which brings with it the economies of
scale. As a result, the per unit cost of
production comes down as the total
cost is divided by larger number of
units. Thus, the expenditure on
advertisement adds to the total cost
but the per unit cost comes down
which in fact lessens the burden of
consumers rather than adding to it.

2. Undermines Social Values: Another
important criticism of advertising is
that it undermines social values and
promotes materialism. It breeds
discontent among people as they come
to know about new products and feel
dissatisfied with their present state of
affairs. Some advertisements show new
life styles, which don’t find social
approval.
This criticism is not entirely true.
Advertisement in fact helps buyers by
informing them about the new
products, which may be improvement
over the existing products. If the
buyers are not informed about these
products, they may be using inefficient
products. Further, the job of an
advertisement is to inform. The final
choice to buy or not to buy anyway
rests with the buyers. They will buy if
the advertised product satisfies some
of their needs. They may be motivated
to work harder to be able to purchase
these products.

3. Confuses the Buyers: Another
criticism against advertisement is that
so many products are being advertised
which makes similar claims that the
buyer gets confused as to which one
is true and which one should be relied
upon. For example, we may note
similar claims of whiteness or stain
removing abilities in competing
brands of detergent powder or claims
of whiteness of tooth or ‘feelings of
freshness’ in competing brands of
toothpaste that it is sometimes
confusing to us as to which one to buy.
The supporters of advertisement,
however, argue that we are all rational
human beings who make our decisions
for purchase of products on factors
such as price, style, size, etc. Thus the
buyers can clear their confusion by
analysing the information provided on
the advertisements and other sources
before taking a decision to purchase a
product. However, this criticism cannot
be completely overruled.

In fact superiority and inferiority
depends on the quality, which is a
relative concept. The desired level of
quality will depend on the economic
status and preferences of the target
customers. Advertisements sell
products of a given quality and the
buyers will buy if it suits their
requirements. No advertisement
should however, make false claim
about the quality of a product. If a firm
makes a false claims it can be
prosecuted for the same.

chances of misuse of advertising as a
tool, which can be properly
safeguarded by the law or by
developing a code of conduct by the

Publicity is similar to advertising, in the
sense that it is a non-personal form of
communication. However, as against
advertising it is a non-paid form of
communication. Publicity generally
takes place when favourable news is
presented in the mass media about a
product or service. For example, if a
manufacturer achieves a breakthrough
by developing a car engine, which runs
on water instead of petrol, and this news
is covered by television or radio or
newspapers in the form of a news item.
It would be termed as publicity because
the engine manufacturer would benefit
from such dissemination of information
about its achievement by the media but
would not bear any cost for the same.
Thus, the two important features of
publicity are that:
Publicity is an unpaid form of
communication. It does not involve
any direct expenditure by the
marketing firm; and
(ii) There is no identified sponsor for
the communication as the message
goes as a news item.
In publicity, as the information is
disseminated by an independent
source, e.g., the press in the form of
news stories and features, the message
has more credibility than if that comes
as a sponsored message in advertising.
Also, as the message goes in the
form of a news rather than direct sales
communication, it can reach even to
those persons who otherwise may not
pay attention to paid communication.
However, an important limitation of
publicity is that as a medium of
promotion, it is not within the control
of a marketing firm. The media would
cover only those pieces of information,
which are news worthy and which
symbolise some achievement in the
field. Thus, a firm can’t use publicity
to actively promote its products.

Managing public opinion of an
organisation is an important task which
can be performed by the marketing
department. The business needs to
communicate effectively to customers,
suppliers, and dealers, since they are
instrumental in increasing the sales
and profit. Besides those who come into
direct contact with the organisation or
its products, there are other members
of the general public whose voice or
opinion is equally important. This

public may be interested in the
company and its product and have an
impact on the business ability to
achieve its objectives. Thus, it becomes
imperative to manage public opinion
and the company’s relation with the
public on a regular basis. Therefore,
public relations involve a variety of
programmes designed to promote or
protect a company’s image and its
individual products in the eyes of the
public.
The business relates with a number
of groups including suppliers,
shareholders, intermediaries, activist
groups, and the government. For
example, active support of middlemen
is needed if the firm wants to survive in
a competitive selling environment.
Similarly, consumer activist groups
need to be satisfied because they can
impose restriction on the sales of the
firm’s products directly by urging
customers to refrain from buying them
or through the imposition of laws. Most
organisations, business or otherwise
nowadays, have a separate department
to manage public relations. They may
also utilize the services of any outside
public relations agency.
Their main task is to disseminate
information and build goodwill about
the business. Concrete steps are to be
taken to monitor the attitude of the
general public and generate positive
publicity. They are especially useful
when there is negative publicity about
the company or its products. At that
time, the situation has to be tackled like
an emergency to improve public image.
The public relations department then
has to do something drastic so that
damage to company’s images is
controlled and minimised. They also
advise top management to adopt
certain programmes which will add to
their public image and ensure that
negative publicity does not take place
at all.

rely on these materials to reach and
influence their target markets.
Speeches by the company’s
executives at a meeting of trade
associations or trade fairs can really
boost the company’s image. Even

media go a long way in promoting
public relations.

Marketing Mix is a set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its

combined to create an offer.

Product: In common parlance, the word ‘product’, is used to refer only to the
physical or tangible attributes of a product. In marketing, product is a mixture
of tangible and intangible attributes, which are capable of being exchanged
for a value, with ability to satisfy customer needs. It is anything that can be
offered to a market to satisfy a want or need. Products may broadly be classified
into two categories—industrial products and consumers’ products. Products,
which are purchased, by the ultimate consumers or users for satisfying their
personal needs and desires are referred to as consumer products. On the basis
of shopping efforts involved, the products are classified as Convenience Product,
Shopping Products and Speciality Products. On the basis of their durability,
consumer products have been classified into categories—Durable, Non-durable
and Services.

Those activities, benefits or satisfactions, which are offered for sale, e.g., dry
cleaning, watch repairs, hair cutting, are called services.

other products. These are broadly classified in to (i) Materials and Parts, (ii)
Capital Items, and (iii) Supplies and Business Services.

a book, a wristwatch, and tyre. A brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design
or some combination of them, used to identify the products—goods or services
of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of the
competitors. That part of a brand, which can be spoken, is called a brand
name.
That part of a brand which can be recognized but which is not utter able is
called brand mark. Brand mark appears in the form of a symbol, design, distinct
colour scheme or lettering. Brand or part of a brand that is given legal protection

Nokia takes four-lane road to consumers.
NEW DELHI: After having grabbed a king-size 79% share of the Rs 15,000-
crore mobile handset market in India, Nokia India has found a new way of
connecting people.
The mobile handset manufacturer has embarked upon a brand new retail
strategy that is based on a classification of its consumers into four major
groups that separates people in terms of usage, income level and lifestyle.
The classification is based on an extensive survey – the Nokia Segmentation
Study —that was carried over two years involving 42,000 consumers from 16
countries. It studied the impact lifestyle choices and attitudes have on the
mobile devices consumers buy and how they use them.
The strategy, which was announced globally in June last year, is being
unfolded in India now. While the nitty-gritty of the new strategy is still being

worked out, it is likely that the company would follow separate marketing
strategies for the four different segments. The advertising campaigns could be
different for the segments.
Nokia’s entire product portfolio has now been re-aligned towards these four
groups to address the specific needs of each. The first of these segments Live,
aimed a first time users whose basic need is to stay in touch with voice as the
main driver, would have basic handsets low on features and price.
“These may be functional phones but the target group for these phones
range from SEC C (low socio-economic class) to SEC A1+ (very high socio-
economic class) markets,” says Nokia India marketing head Devinder Kishore.
The second segment Connect looks at more evolved users who look for more
functionality and features and connectivity. Accordingly, phones in this
segment would have GPRS, camera and music capabilities.
The next two categories, Achieve and Explore, are aimed at high-end users
and have Nokia’s top-end handsets. For example, Achieve segment looks at
enterprise users who need to have business functionalities in their phones.
Nokia’s new E-series has been put under this segment with handsets having
QWERTY keyboards and full Internet capabilities.
Aimed at high-end lifestyle users, Explore would be the most prominent
segment for the company in the coming years. Says Nokia India multimedia
business director Vineet Taneja, “This segment would see the most vibrant
growth in the coming year. It will look at five different areas – applications,
imaging, mobile TV, music and gaming. We are fast developing the ecosystem
to support these areas.”
Nokia acquired music solution and content provider LoudEye and GPS
solution provider Gate5. It is all slated to launch its most high-profile handset,
which boasts of having a 5 mega pixel camera and GPS capabilities apart
from iPod quality music, in February.
Says Taneja, “There is increasing demand for convergence and multiple
functionalities in high-end handsets. The N-series will try to address that.” Nokia
feels that the new platform strategy wherein different handsets are launched
under a platform, like the N-Series, will become a status and style statement
and drive numbers.

The Maharashtra State Consumer
Commission has asked Coca Cola, one
of the international fizzy drinks

bottler
distributor to pay Rs one lakh in
damages to a consumer who found
impurities in a bottle of soft drink that
he had bought.
Chandrashekhar Paradkar, a
resident of Shankar Nagar area here,
filed a complaint with the Nagpur
district Consumer Grievances Fourm
seeking compensation of Rupees four
lakh after he found some solid objects
inside a sealed bottle of a soft drink.
He had bought six various brands of
the soft drink— two bottles each of
Mazaa, Coca Cola and Sprite from a
shop near his house.
Based on that, the District Forum

of supplying drinks unfit for human
consumption, which was upheld by the
State Consumer Commission.
The District Forum had found
objects resembling pieces of mosquito
repellent mats floating inside the sealed
bottle. Having conducted the tests by a
Public Health Laboratory, they found
the drink unfit for human consumption.

means that a consumer might be
exposed to risks due to unsafe
products, might suffer from bad health
due to adulterated food products,
might be cheated because of
misleading advertisements or sale of
spurious products, might have to pay
a higher price when sellers engage in
overpricing, hoarding or black-

for providing adequate protection to
consumers against such practices of
the sellers. Let us now discuss the

Consumer Protection has a wide
agenda. It not only includes educating
consumers about their rights and
responsibilities, but also helps in
getting their grievances redressed. It
not only requires a judicial machinery
for protecting the interests of
consumers but also requires the
consumers to get together and form
The above case is just one of the
examples of the many problems that
consumers might have to face in the
purchase, use and consumption of
goods and services. The case also
highlights the need for an appropriate
legal protection to be provided to
consumers to protect them from
various forms of exploitation from the
seller. Have you ever thought what
would be the plight of consumers if
adequate protection is not provided to
them? Can the present day businesses
afford to ignore the interests of
consumers? The area of consumer
protection has emerged as a very
important area of study having
significance for both the consumers
and businesses alike.

A consumer is said to be a king in a
free market economy. The earlier
approach of caveat emptor, which
means “Let the buyer beware”, has
now been changed to caveat venditor
(“Let the seller beware”). However, with
growing competition and in an attempt
to increase their sales and market
share, manufacturers and service-
providers may be tempted to engage
multinational giants would not be allowed to have a free run and exploit a poor country
like India by manufacturing and marketing sub-standard products.
While giving its ruling, the District Forum relied upon the historic Donald versus
Stevenson case, wherein heavy compensation had been awarded to a consumer,
who had found rusted nails inside a bottle of ginger beer.

with substandard products or do not
conform to the safety norms might
cause serious injury. Thus, consumers
are educated that they should use

A restaurant owner in east Delhi has been directed to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000 to a
customer who was asked to shell out Rs. 34 for a water bottle which had a maximum
retail price (MRP) of Rs.12. The fine comes at a time when consumer courts are
turning the heat on shop-owners who overcharge. In a recent landmark decision, the
state consumer commission had slapped a fine of Rs. 50,000 on a cineplex for similar
malpractice. Goel was awarded the compensation by east district consumer forum
president and members directing Zaika Bazaar, Karkardooma Complex, to compensate
Goel for overcharging. The Forum said: “The present complaint is covered by the
judgment of the state consumer commision in case of Nirulas vs Ankit Jain in which
it said no trader or service provider can charge more price than an item’s MRP printed
on the packed item, if delivered packed”. Ordering the restaurant owner to discontinue
the malpractice, the forum said charging higher amount than MRP, if delivered in
packed form, was against the law of the land. Goel had bought a bottle of Aquafina
water from the restaurant in November last year and was asked to pay Rs.34 for it,
including a VAT of Rs. 4, when the bottle had a MRP of Rs.12 printed on it.

Under the Consumer Protection Act, a consumer can file a complaint against the
manufacturers or sellers for any defective good supplied to him or any deficient
services rendered to him.
In Jose Philip Mampillil vs. M/s Premier automobiles Ltd. & Anr, a diesel car
purchased by the appellant (consumer) was found defective. The defects in the car
were not removed by the defendants (manufacturer and dealer). The Commissioner
appointed by the District Forum found a large number of defects in the car.
Consequently, the District Forum directed repair of car free of cost and replacement
of engine. The order was upheld by the State Commission except for the direction
for replacement of engine.
In the case of Sashikant Krishnaii Dole vs. Shikshan Prasarak Mandali, the
National Commission held that failure to amount basic safeguards in the swimming
pool amounts to deficiency in service. A school owned a swimming pool and offered
swimming facilities to the public on payment of a fee. The school conducted winter
and summer training camps to train boys in swimming and for this purpose engaged
a coach. The plaintiffs enrolled their only son for learning swimming under the
guidance of the coach. It was alleged that due to the negligence of the coach, the
boy drowned and died. The school denied any responsibility on its part. The coach
claimed that he had considerable experience in coaching young boys is swimming.
When the deceased was found to have been drowned, the coach immediately took
him out of the water and removed the water from his stomach and gave him artificial
respiration and thereafter took him to a doctor. The doctor advised that the boy be
taken to the nearest hospital where the boy died. The State Commission held the
school and the coach deficient in rendering service to the deceased. On appeal, the
order was upheld by the National Commission.

CERS Wins Case against Railways
In a case filed by Consumer Education and Research Society (CERS), Ahmedabad,
and a senior couple, the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad City,
has held the Railways responsible for negligence and directed it to pay Rs. 2000
to the couple for its mental agony and Rs. 3000 towards cost.
Mr. Man Mohan Singh and his wife Kamlesh had bought a railway journey-
cum-reservation ticket at Ahmedabad for travel from New Delhi to Kanpur Central
by the Shatabdi Express on 2 December 2001. The details on the ticket, including
the coach number, the date of journey, etc., were illegible. Hence, they were
forced to buy another ticket for journey from New Delhi to Kanpur. They applied
for a refund for the earlier ticket but, as the Forum noted, they had to suffer
much for the purpose. In spite of the couple’s giving the Ahmedabad residential
address for sending the refund, the Railways sent it to their Delhi address. They
approached CERS for help.
CERS filed a complaint against the Railways before the Consumer Dispute
Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad City, under Sections 2(1)(g) and 2(1)(o) of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. CERS claimed that the two senior citizens had
to face mental harassment due to the deficiency in service by the Railways. The
Railways contended, among other things, that the Forum had no territorial
jurisdiction after cancellation of the ticket, the couple were no more consumers
in the eye of the law, the complaint was time-barred and the Railway Claim
Tribunal was the proper forum to entertain the complaint about refund.
The Forum, however, observed that the couple’s difficulties amounted to the
Railways’ deficiency in service and ordered it to pay Rs. 2000 to the couple for
the mental agony suffered by them and Rs. 3000 as cost. The Forum did not
decide on the amount of refund, which it said, was “to be exclusively dealt with
by the Railway Claim Tribunal”.

”Online registration of complaints, the government hopes, will promote
e-governance, transparency, efficiency and streamlining of consumer fora,” said
an official in the consumer affairs ministry. Of Rs 48.64 crore set aside for the
project, the government has released Rs 30.56 crore so far, the official added.
”Besides software development and testing, networking and project
implementation, integration and site preparation, it will include purchase of
hardware for all the 600 district fora, 35 state commissions and the National
Commission,” the official said.
At present, computer systems and system software have been delivered to 25
state commissions and 300 district fora — never mind the fact that it’s
sometimes a long wait before the hardware is finally unpacked and set up in
some of the districts. Meanwhile, training of staff, sometimes in the classroom
and sometimes through e-learning sessions, are in full swing.
”But just setting up an online complaint filing system won’t ensure a strong
consumer protection movement in the country — for that we’re working on
GenNext and the best way to do that is to go to schools,” the official said.
The government is, therefore, involving school children to form consumer clubs
so as to involve them in various consumer welfare activities.
Part of the funding for running the club is to come from various state
governments, with an equally matching grant from the Centre. However, a
number of state governments are yet to sanction the fund — some of these
include Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.

Until 1981 Narayan Reddy, M.Sc.
Organic Chemistry, had been working
for a pharmaceutical company where he
had developed a molecule. He was
contemplating commercial utilisation of
that molecule by setting up a small-scale
unit – much smaller than what he
actually started. Actually, he met two
medicos, who had just returned from a
Gulf country and were looking for some
productive avenue for investment of
their savings (remember the Gulf
crisis?), Reddy’s idea appealed to them.
Thus, the willing entrepreneurs met–
where there is a will there is a way–
and the seeds for the venture were
sown. After a detailed study of the
technical, economic, commercial and
financial feasibility of the idea of
manufacturing a bulk drug from the
molecule, ‘Virchow Laboratories’ was
started in 1982 as a SSI with an initial
investment of Rs. 28 lakhs – Rs. 8 lakh
in the form of equal contribution by the
three promoters and Rs. 20 lakh
funding from the Andhra Pradesh
State Finance Corporation (APSFC).
Project implementation was even more
challenging as he set out to acquire land,
construct factory, purchase equipment,
negotiate with suppliers, potential
customers and obtain environmental,
drug control and other clearances.
Initially, it was he who acted as the pivot
of the enterprise wheel. In the course of
time, a strong managerial team was put
in place and thanks to persistent
emphasis on good management

And, in the process, entrepreneurship
becomes crucial for overall economic
development of a nation.
Given its important role in the
overall scheme of economic development,
it is interesting to note that not
many persons opt for a career in
entrepreneurship. Traditionally, it was
believed that entrepreneurs are born.
No society can wait for the chance
of ‘birth’ of entrepreneurs to pursue its
developmental plans. In fact, plans for
economic development would bear
little fruit unless entrepreneurship
development is regarded as a deliberate
process of making people aware of
entrepreneurship as a career at an early
age and creating situations where they
may actually make a choice to become
entrepreneurs.
When you make this choice, you
become a job-provider rather than a
job-seeker, besides enjoying a host of
other financial and psychological
rewards. Taking to entrepreneurship is
surely more a matter of aspiring to
become an entrepreneur rather as
being born as one.

Entrepreneurship is the process of
setting up one’s own business as distinct
from pursuing any other economic
activity, be it employment or practising
some profession. The person who
set-up his business is called an
entrepreneur. The output of the process,
that is, the business unit is called an
enterprise. You may invoke ‘subject-
verb-object (SVO)’ relationship in English
grammar to clearly understand these
terms. (See Figure on SVO Analogy)
It is interesting to note that
entrepreneurship besides providing
self-employment to the entrepreneur is
responsible to a great extent for creation
and expansion of opportunities for the
other two economic activities, that is,
employment and profession. (Can you
think why and how?) Further, each
business gives rise to other businesses–
the suppliers of raw materials and
components, service providers (be it
transport, courier, telecom, distributor
middlemen and advertising firms,
accounting firms and advocates etc.
practices, Virchow emerged as the world’s largest and the best producer of the basic
drug from the chosen molecule. In fact, web search on ‘Virchow Laboratories’ takes
you to the home page saying “Welcome to Virchow Group of Companies”, the group
comprising 4 companies with Virchow Laboratories being the flagship company.

You are aware that entrepreneurship
is regarded as one of the four major
factors of production, the other three
being land, labour and capital.
However, it should surprise you that
as regards its French origin, the term
‘entrepreneurship’ (derived from the
verb ‘entreprende’ meaning ‘to
undertake’) pertained not to economics
but to undertaking of military
expeditions. So is true of many terms
in management such as strategy (a
course of action to beat the competition,
the ‘enemy’) and logistics (movement of
men and machines for timely
availability), etc. Historically, as wars
are followed by economic recons-
truction, it should be no surprise that
military concepts are used in
economics and management. It may be
pointed out that whereas the wars are
rare and far between, in today’s
competitive world, entrepreneurs wage
wars everyday. There is a tremendous
pressure to continually develop new
products, explore new markets, update
technology and devise innovative ways
of marketing and so on.
The term ‘entrepreneur’ was first
introduced in economics by the early
18th century French economist Richard
Cantillon. In his writings, he formally
defined the entrepreneur as the “agent
who buys means of production at certain
prices in order to sell the produce at
uncertain prices in the future”. Since then
a perusal of the usage of the term in
economics shows that entrepreneurship
implies risk/uncertainty bearing;
coordination of productive resources;
introduction of innovations; and the
provision of capital.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT
We would like to define entrepre-
neurship as a systematic, purposeful
and creative activity of identifying a
need, mobilising resources and
organising production with a view to
delivering value to the customers,
returns for the investors and profits for
the self in accordance with the risks
and uncertainties associated with
business. This definition points to certain
characteristics of entrepreneurship that
we turn our attention to.

In the SVO formulation of the concepts
of entrepreneur, entrepreneurship and
enterprise, we saw that entrepreneur-
ship is about the process of setting up
a business. One cannot help but
marvel at the beauty of the process: how
does one first of all decide to choose own
business as a career; how does one
sense a market opportunity; how does
one muster up courage to embark
upon it, and mobilise the requisite
resources, etc.; so much so that
recourse to entrepreneurship, in
common parlance, is considered as an
exclusive preserve of a few gifted
individuals. In the following paragraphs,
our effort would be to establish
entrepreneurship as a career that you
should aspire for. Remember, resources
may be limited, aspiration need not be.
So, you can aspire for something
greater, bigger than your present status
and resources. And start today.
Remember, aspiration means desire
multiplied by action.

charm and something that happens

certain temperamental, skill and other
knowledge and competency requirements
that can be acquired, learnt and
developed, both by formal educational
and vocational training as well as by
observation and work experience. Such
an understanding of the process of
entrepreneurship is crucial for dispelling

The object of entrepreneurship is lawful

of this as one may try to legitimise
unlawful actions as entrepreneurship
on the grounds that just as
entrepreneurship entails risk, so does
illicit businesses. Purpose of entrepre-
neurship is creation of value for
personal profit and social gain.

Innovation: From the point of
view of the firm, innovation may be cost
saving or revenue-enhancing. If it does
both it is more than welcome. Even if it
does none, it is still welcome as
innovation must become a habit!
Entrepreneurship is creative in the
sense that it involves creation of value.
You must appreciate that in the
absence of entrepreneurship ‘matter’
does not become a “resource.” By
combining the various factors of
production, entrepreneurs produce
goods and services that meet the needs
and wants of the society. Every
entrepreneurial act results in income
and wealth generation. Even when
innovations destroy the existing
industries, for example, zerox machines
destroyed carbon paper industry,
mobile telephony threatens landline/
basic telephony, net gains accruing to
the economy lend such entrepreneurial
actions as commendable as the acts of
creative destruction.
Entrepreneurship is creative also
in the sense that it involves
innovation- introduction of new
products, discovery of new markets
and sources of supply of inputs,
technological breakthroughs as well as
introduction of newer organisational
forms for doing things better, cheaper,
faster and, in the present context, in a
manner that causes the least harm to
the ecology/environment. It is possible
that entrepreneurs in developing
countries may not be pioneering/
innovative in introducing path-
breaking, radical innovations. They
may be the first or second adopters of
technologies developed elsewhere.
That does not make their achievement
small. For imitating technologies from
developed world to the indigenous
setting is quite challenging. A lady
entrepreneur wanting to introduce
thermal pads for industrial heating
faced tremendous reluctance form the
owners of chemical and sugar mills
despite the established superiority of
her products over the conventional
heating of the vessels by burning of
wood/coke or using LPG. Moreover,
there is no need to suffer from “it was
not invented here” complex– there is
no need to reinvent the wheel. The
global electronics major, Sony did not
invent the transistor! It used the

transistor to build entertainment
products that are world leaders.
4. Organisation of Production:
Organisation of Production:
Organisation of Production:
Organisation of Production:
Organisation of Production:
Production, implying creation of form,
place, time personal utility, requires
the combined utilisation of diverse
factors of production, land, labour,
capital and technology. Entrepreneur,
in response to a perceived business
opportunity mobilises these resources
into a productive enterprise or firm.
It may be pointed out that the
entrepreneur may not be possessing
any of these resources; he may just
have the ‘idea’ that he promotes among
the resource providers. In an economy
with a well-developed financial system,
he has to convince just the funding
institutions and with the capital so
arranged he may enter into contracts
of supply of equipment, materials,
utilities (such as water and electricity)
and technology. What lies at the core
of organisation of production is the
knowledge about availability and
location of the resources as well as the
optimum way to combine them. An
entrepreneur needs negotiation skills
to raise these in the best interests of
the enterprise. Organisation of
production also involves product
development and development of the
market for the product. Besides,
entrepreneur may be required to
develop even the sources of supply of
requisite inputs. For example, whether
it is a matter of putting together an
automobile manufacturing unit or
manufacture of burger/pizza, besides
cultivating a market and developing
products to suit its tastes and
preferences, there would be a need to
develop a pool of suppliers of the
diverse components or elements that
go into their manufacture.
5. Risk-taking:
Risk-taking:
Risk-taking:
Risk-taking:
Risk-taking: As the entrepreneur
contracts for an assured supply of the
various inputs for his project, he incurs
the risk of paying them off whether or
not the venture succeeds. Thus,
landowner gets the contracted rent,
capital providers gets the contracted
interest, and the workforce gets the
contracted wages and salaries.
However, there is no assurance of profit
to the entrepreneur.
It may be pointed out that the
possibility of absolute ruin may be rare
as the entrepreneur does everything
within his control to de-risk the
business. For example he may enter
into prior contract with the customers
of his production. So much so that he
may just be contract manufacturer or
marketer of someone else’s products!
What is generally implied by risk-
taking is that realised profit may be
less than the expected profit.
It is generally believed that
entrepreneurs take high risks. Yes,
individuals opting for a career in
entrepreneurship take a bigger risk
that involved in a career in employment
or practice of a profession as there is
no “assured” payoff. (See Box above)
In practice, for example, when a person
quits a job to start on his own, he tries
to calculate whether he or she would
be able to earn the same level of income
or not. To an observer, the risk of
quitting a well-entrenched and
promising career seems a “high” risk,
2015-16(21/01/2015)
BUSINESS STUDIES
but what the person has taken is a
calculated risk. The situation is
similarly to a motorcyclist in the ‘ring
of death’ or a trapeze artist in circus.
While the spectators are in the awe of
the high-risk, the artists have taken a
calculated risk given their training,
skills, and of course, confidence and
daring. It is said that the entrepreneurs
thrive on circumstances where odds
favouring and against success area
even, that is 50:50 situations. They are
so sure of their capabilities that they
convert 50% chances into 100%
success. They avoid situations with
higher risks as they hate failure as
anyone would do; they dislike lower
risk situations as business ceases to
be a game/fun! Risk as such more
than a financial stake, becomes a matter
of personal stake, where less than
expected
performance
causes
displeasure and distress.
The characteristics of entrepreneur-
ship discussed as above apply in
diverse contexts, so does the usage
of the term, viz., Agricultural/Rural
Entrepreneurship, Industrial entrepre-
neurship, Technopreneurship, Netpre-

Understanding Entrepreneurial Returns and Risks
Entrepreneurial returns are based on a mathematical expectation, E (Ri) where
the subscript ‘i’ shows that there are a number of possible rates of return
from a business decision, say, 20%, 18%, 17% and 15%. Actually, there may
be quite a large distribution of alternative returns from an investment decision,
we have taken just 4 observations to keep it simple. Supposing all these returns
are equally likely, then E (Ri) would be the simple average of these returns.
That is, E (Ri) = φ = 20+18+17+15/4= 17.5%. In other words, the expected
returns from the entrepreneurial decision in this case are 17.5 %. Risk can
be measured in terms of a measure of variation around this expectation, more
precisely it is the standard deviation of the distribution of returns or óRi. In
this case it works out be 1.8 %. In other words, actual or realised returns may
deviate from expected returns to the extent of 1.8%. Clearly, higher the value
of standard deviation, larger the risk. It is often said that higher the risk
greater the returns. What this means is as under:
(a) for a given risk, a rational person would prefer a higher than or equal to
the expected returns.
(b) for a given return, a rational person would prefer a lower risk.
(c) should the risk increase, there should be at least a proportional increase
in returns.
(d) because the risk runs either ways, that is, realised returns may be more
or less that the expected returns, entrepreneurs who are incorrigibly
optimistic, tend to believe that variation would only be one-sided, that is,
on the higher side.

Entrepreneurship is about business
start-ups and renewals. That is, it
appears at the time of starting a new
business, disappears for some time in
the course of stabilising the venture as
an on-going business and reappears in
case there is a need for introducing
changes in product, market, technology,
structure and so on. In fact, it is said that
everyone is an entrepreneur when he
actually ‘carries out new combinations,’
and loses that character as soon as he
has built up his business, when he
settles down to running it as other people
run their businesses. In developed
countries, the distinction between the
entrepreneurial focus on start-ups and
managerial focus on routine is so sharp
that it is argued that once the project
has reached a level of maturity, the
entrepreneurs must move out and the
managers must come in.
In developing countries, however, the
concept of owner-manager seems more
apt for entrepreneurship as the
entrepreneur remains attached even to
the day-to-day operations of the venture.
In fact, their lacking in managerial skills
is often forwarded as the cause of
business failures. Just as managers are
expected to play entrepreneurial roles in
the times of need, likewise the
entrepreneurs must also demonstrate
managerial abilities for the success of
their ventures. Irrespective of whether the
entrepreneurs pave way for the managers
or they themselves assume the
managerial responsibilities, it is possible
to distinguish between the terms
entrepreneurship and management. (See

Whereas, a developing country needs
entrepreneurs to initiate the process of

entrepreneurship to sustain it. In the
present Indian context, where on the
one hand, employment opportunities
in public sector and large-scale sector
are shrinking, and on the other,
vast opportunities arising from

entrepreneurship can really take India

national level of entrepreneurial activity
across a number of countries (visit,
www.gemconsortium.org) show that
differences in the levels of entrepreneurial
activity account for the differences in
the level of economic growth to the
extent of as much as 33%.
What is that the entrepreneurs do
to affect economic development? This
leads us to a discussion of the functions
of the entrepreneurs in relation to
economic development. As the
enterprise is the object of their
endeavour, it is also necessary that we
examine their functions in relation to
the enterprise as well.
Thus, the need for entrepre-
neurship arises from the functions the
entrepreneurs perform in relation to the
process of economic development and
in relation to the business enterprise.

You are aware that entrepreneurs
“organise” the production process. In
the absence this function, all other
resources, namely land, labour and
capital would remain idle. They may
not be inventing/discovering the
products, their role in commercial
exploitation of the advancements in
science and technology via organisation
of the productive apparatus makes the
other resources productive and useful.
So much so that it is said that in the
absence of entrepreneurial intervention,
every plant would remain a weed and
every mineral would remain a rock.

It needs them for two reasons: to capitalise on new opportunities and to create
wealth and new jobs. A McKinsey and Company–Nasscom report estimates that
India needs at least 8,000 new businesses to achieve its target of building a $ 87
billion IT sector by 2008. Similarly, in the next 10 years, 110-130 million Indian
citizens will be searching for jobs, including 80-100 million looking for their first
jobs; that’s seven times Australia’s population. This does not include disguised
unemployment of over 50% among the 230 million employed in rural India. Since
traditional large employers – including the government and the old economy players –
may find it difficult to sustain this level of employment in the future, it is
entrepreneurs who will create these new jobs and opportunities.

2. Capital Formation: The entrepre-

investment decision that augments the

and hence results in capital formation.
In fact, GDP and capital formation are
related to each other via Capital Output
Ratio (COR); more precisely Incremental
Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) that
measures the percentage increase in
capital formation required obtaining a
percentage increase in GDP. So, if a
country desires to grow @ 10.0 % p.a.
and its ICOR is 2.6, then it must ensure
capital formation @ 26.0% p.a.
Entrepreneurs, by investing their own
savings and informally mobilising the
savings of their friends and relatives
contribute to the process of capital
formation. These informal funding
supplements the funds made available
by the formal means of raising
resources from banks, financial
institutions and capital markets.

With a contribution of 40% to the country’s industrial output and 35% to
direct exports, the Small-Scale Industry (SSI) sector has achieved significant
milestones for the industrial development of India. Within the SSI sector, an
important role is played by the numerous clusters that have been in existence
for decades and sometimes even for centuries. According to a United Nations
Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), there are 388 SSI clusters
having 4,90,000 enterprises, employing 7.5 million persons with an output of
Rs. 160,000 crore p.a. The number. of entrepreneurs in these clusters has
been growing @ 15-18% p.a. over the last ten years. Besides, there are
approximately 2000 rural and artisan based clusters in India.
Some Indian SSE clusters are so big that they account for 90 per cent of
India’s total production output in selected products. As for example, the
knitwear cluster of Ludhiana and Hosiery cluster in Tripur in Tamil Nadu.
Almost the entire Gems and Jewellery exports are from the clusters of Surat
and Mumbai. Similarly, the clusters of Chennai, Agra and Kolkata are well
known for leather and leather products.
However, the majority of Indian clusters, especially in the handicrafts sector,
are very small with no more than hundred workers, so specialised that no
other place in the world matches their skills and the quality of their output.
This is the case, for example, of the Paithani sarees cluster in Maharashtra.
However, only a tiny minority of such artisan clusters are globally competitive.
The formidable challenges created for the SSE sector by the liberalisation
of the Indian economy, as well as its closer integration within the global
economy, have generated a great deal of interest within India on novel
approaches to SSE development. As a result, both private and public sector
institutions at the Central as well as the State levels are increasingly
undertaking cluster development initiatives.

Monitor studies report a lag of 1-2
years between entrepreneurial

leads to economic development, the
vice-versa is also true. That is,
economic development also fosters
entrepreneurship development. Growing
economies provide a fertile soil for the
flourishing of entrepreneurship, an aspect

Drawing an analogy from musicology
in explaining the role of the
entrepreneurs in relation to their
enterprise, one may say that an
entrepreneur is not only the composer
of the musical score and the conductor
of orchestra but also a one man band.
His roles and functions get much
broader in scope in a developing
country context like ours. entitled ‘Role
and Functions of the Entrepreneur in
Relation to his/her enterprise.’
These elements are no sequential as
the figure may convey, the entrepreneur
may have to address to all these elements
simultaneously. Yet, depending upon
their backgrounds, the individual
entrepreneur may prefer one over the
other. For example, technicians tend to
be over obsessed with the production
aspect; those with marketing background
may over emphasise creation of market.
Investor type entrepreneurs may be
over concerned with the returns from
the project. One should resist the
temptation of looking at the business
only from one’s own narrow perspective.
Having said this, it is apt that we
provide a brief description of the
various issues that may be relevant at
each stage.

Note: The scope of the entrepreneurial functions varies with the level of
economy in which the entrepreneur operates; scale of production/operations;
and entrepreneurs’ comparative efficiency in utilising managerial employees.
In developed countries, entrepreneurship assumes upon themselves the
responsibility of introducing innovations and after some time, pave way for
the managers. In large-scale organisations, entrepreneurs provide leadership
and there is a team of managers to look after specific aspects of enterprise.
Likewise, those entrepreneurs who have the ability and willingness to delegate
may concentrate on a select few, strategic aspects of enterprise.
In terms of the process of setting up a business, therefore, an entrepreneur
is on the look out for and spots the business opportunity, assesses its value,
develops it in the form of a product/service idea, assembles he resources
and gets going.

the question is what to export and
where? You may be required to compile
a country-product matrix to be able to
decide. (See proforma)
This way you may arrive at the
product-market combination showing
the fastest growing import and from
your point of view export potential.
Deciding on the product offering
makes the highest demand on the
entrepreneur’s
creativity
innovativeness. Yet, in a competitive
environment, it is possible to
differentiate your product offering even
if the generic product is the same and
serves the same need.
Clearly decision on specific
product offering necessitates decisions
on who is buying, why, and what are
the value expectations. You will be able
to succeed when the value delivered
not only meets but also exceeds
customers’ expectations and create a
‘Vow!’ impact.

that is it should be possible with the

possible at a cost that can be covered

the idea must be economically feasible
too. The project cost should be within
the resources available and the resource
providers should be reasonably sure of
an appropriate return on (profit) and
return of (safety and liquidity) of their
investments. That is, the idea must be
financially viable as well. There should
be enough sales in the immediate and
the prospect of growth in the foreseeable
future; there should be adequate
assurance on the commercial viability
of the chosen product offering. Now a
day, it is also important to be sure that
there aren’t any environmental and
other legal restrictions/necessity of prior
approvals for setting up the business.
It is also to be decided as to whether the
business will be organised as a
proprietary concern/partnership firm/
company or cooperative entity.
Clearly the chosen product offering
must be feasible from the diverse
perspectives. You must compile these
findings in the form of a business plan
that would have to be submitted to the
funding authorities, in the Indian
context, the State Finance Corporation

Entrepreneurship does not emerge
spontaneously. Rather it is the outcome
of a dynamic process of interaction
between the person and the
environment. Ultimately the choice of
entrepreneurship as a career lies with
the individual, yet he must see it as a

experience self-perceived barriers to
entrepreneurship. They could be having
a low perception of self-efficacy either
on account of lack of resources (or to be

knowledge or know-how, and the skills.

competencies, which now we turn our

we will be discussing separately) in a
person that mark his/her effectiveness
for a task. The phrase ‘composite’ is
crucial. For example, the competence
“ability to communicate vision” is much
more than proficiency in writing/
speaking skills. It would involve, just to
illustrate, vision clarity, understanding
the audience background, interest and
readiness, knowledge about the media
and choosing the most appropriate one,
attracting attention, delivery, leaving not
merely an impression but also an
impact and, assessing effectiveness. So,
when the entrepreneur in the television
interview pointed out KASH as the
determinants
successful
entrepreneurship, he was indeed
referring to the competencies.
Competency approach to human
resource development in general and
entrepreneurship development in
particular was pioneered by David
McClelland, a Harvard University
psychologist in the late 1960’s and early
1970’s. (You will be learning more on
McClelland’s work when we discuss
entrepreneurial motivation.) McClelland
set out to define competency variables
that could be used in predicting job
performance and that were not biased
by race, gender, or socio-economic
factors. As a result, it becomes more
important to learn what a person does
rather than who he/she is. That is why
management and also entrepreneurship
is better defined as what a manager or
an entrepreneur does. Because
competencies can be built via a process
of education and development, we may
say that entrepreneurs are made.
What are the distinct competencies for
entrepreneurship? In this regard one may
refer to the efforts of Entrepreneurship
Development Institute of India (EDI), a
national resource institution in the area
of entrepreneurship education research
and development (visit, www.ediindia.org).
EDI has identified a set of 15
competencies that contribute toward
entrepreneurial performance and success.

Credit for investigating and bringing to the fore the role of need for achievement
goes to McClelland, the Harvard professor whom we referred to also in the
discussion of competency based approach to human resource and
entrepreneurship development. He set out to investigate why some countries
are more developed than others He sought to find answer to this question by
examining the proposition that ‘differences in the level of achievement
motivation are responsible for ‘differences in the level of economic development’.
For this he examined the popular stories and folklore and readers up to primary
classes of 39 countries for finding out whether they focused on personal
accomplishment, triumph of human courage and effort over the circumstances
and so on. McClelland’s research upheld the proposition that differences in
the levels of achievement motivation as revealed by the analysis of the stories
and the readers accounted for the differences in the level of economic
development. How? What would be the process? McClelland observed that
entrepreneurship becomes the medium through which the achievement
motivation manifests the best and through which the development takes off.

performance. It is the desire for an
opportunity for the fullest expression
of one’s abilities. In the context of
entrepreneurship, it is usually
interpreted as the determination not to
work for someone else. In most job
situations, employees are given little
freedom to exercise their discretion in
taking decisions and choosing a course
of action so much so that absence of it
drives them into starting their own
ventures. As such n-pow. becomes
more a desire for preserving one’s ethos
rather than the freedom from the boss.
Take the example of another
Hyderabad based entrepreneur entitled
Entrepreneurship for Preserving
Personal Work Ethos).
What does the above discussion
mean for entrepreneurship development?
It means that for promoting entrepre-
neurship it is important to kindle and
arouse the right motivation. In the
absence of motivation, even able men
and women may not take to entrepre-
neurship. Hence. In every Entrepre-
neurship Awareness Programme (EAP)
or Entrepreneurship Development
Programme (EDP), there are special
sessions on entrepreneurial motivation,
besides sessions on entrepreneurial
competencies.
You may note that motivation and
ability can positively reinforce each
other. Persons having abilities search
for the avenues for their expression and
hence are drawn to entrepreneurship.
Persons eager to be on their own may
strive hard to acquire the necessary
competencies to realise their dreams.
How truly one has said that
entrepreneurs are the dreamers
who do!
In explaining and developing
entrepreneurial motivation, it is
important to learn that different
individuals are motivated differently, and
that one may be trying to satisfy more
than one need through one’s pursuit.
This is an important observation as
economic theory very simply says that
the objective of the firm or that of the
entrepreneur is profit maximisation.

SUMMARY
The terms ‘entrepreneur,’ ‘entrepreneurship’ and ‘enterprise’ can be understood
by drawing an analogy with the structure of a sentence in English language.
Entrepreneur is the person (the subject), entrepreneurship is the process (the
verb) and enterprise is the creation of the person and the output of the process
(the object).
Entrepreneurs play important roles both in relation to economic development
and in relation to the enterprise. In relation to economic development, entrepreneurs
contribute to growth in GDP, capital formation and employment generation besides
creating business opportunities for others and bringing about an improvement
in the quality of life in the community in which they operate. In relation to the
enterprise, they perform a number of roles right from the conception of a business
idea, examining its feasibility and mobilisation of resources for its eventual
realisation as a business firm. They bear the uncertainties and risks associated
with the business activity, introduce product, market, technological and a host of
other innovations. In the developing country context they also assume the
responsibility for the day-to-day management of the enterprise.
Given its critical role in economic development at a broader level and business
start-ups at the micro level, it is imperative that a conscious effort be made to
popularise entrepreneurship as a career option. In this regard, EAPs and EDPs
can play an important role. Besides, there is a need to create an entrepreneurship
friendly environment. Since, entrepreneurship is the outcome of a dynamic
interaction between the person and the environment, there is need also for
developing entrepreneurial competencies, motivations, values and attitudes.

Anshuman was a very industrious sales executive with a small herbal cosmetic
manufacturer. He earned a good salary and commission on the business he
brought for the firm and had very good command over the Delhi market for
which he had virtually become indispensable. He was aware of the enviable
position he held in the firm and thought aloud:
“The key to success in any business is the sale of its products. The beginning
and end of the business cycle is nothing but sale and “other” people working in
the factory to manufacture products are mere cogs in the business machine set
in motion by sales people. So why carry this burden and get only a tiny share of
the prosperity of the firm? Instead others enjoying the fruits of my labour, why
should I not start my own business?”
Should Anshuman take a leap? Give reasons for your answer.

Inspiring Feat: Dailywage Labourer Turns Entrepreneur
A landless woman from Bihar has been nominated among the top 25 farmers in
Asia by a Mexican website.
Forty-five-year old Lalmuni Devi was a daily wage labourer when she decided to
take destiny into her own hands and transformed herself into a successful
mushroom farmer. Today she manages to make Rs. 12,000 every year for an
investment of only Rs. 600.
Her feat finds mention on a Mexican website that has grouped her as the top 25
inspirational farmers in its photo gallery.
”I am a poor woman. I thought that mushroom farming would profit henceforth
I started it. Now I can earn a living for my family,” said Lalmuni Devi.

”It is effortless farming, which we can even do in our village. Working in the
scorching heat is very tiring. Mushroom farming generates more profit,” said
Urmila Devi.
Lalmuni and other landless women have been encouraged by the Indian Council
for Agriculture Research to take up mushroom farming.
”It is to help the poorest of the poor through alternative livelihood support system.
For that we have chosen a village where people have no land and they have to
share croppers,” said Dr A.R. Khan, Principal Scientist, ICAR, Patna.
Lalmuni’s efforts have paved the way for many other landless women to take up
mushroom farming and earn a livelihood for their family with little effort.
