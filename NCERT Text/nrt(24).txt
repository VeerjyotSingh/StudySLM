FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle
marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to
shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify
an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage
rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in
the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National
Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning
and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise
that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by
engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key
reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating
creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress
or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of
curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different
stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving
higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,
discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
2015-16
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory
group in Social Sciences Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor
for this book, Professor R.K. Grover, (Retd.) Director, School of Management
Studies (IGNOU), New Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several
teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to
their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions
and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their
resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members
of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of
Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor
G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation
committed to the systemic reform and continuous improvement in the
quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which
will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

here are certain organisations which are set up
for providing service to its members and the
public in general. Such organisations include clubs,
charitable institutions, schools, religious
organisations, trade unions, welfare societies and
societies for the promotion of art and culture. These
organisations have service as the main objective and
not the profit as is the case of organisations in
business. Normally, these organisations do not
undertake any business activity, and are managed
by trustees who are fully accountable to their
members and the society for the utilization of the
funds raised for meeting the objectives of the
organisation. Hence, they also have to maintain
proper accounts and prepare the financial statement
which take the form of Receipt and Payment
Account; Income and Expenditure Account; and
Balance Sheet. at the end of for every accounting
period (normally a financial year).
This is also a legal requirement and helps them
to keep track of their income and expenditure, the
nature of which is different from those of the business
organisations. In this chapter  we shall learn about
the accounting aspects relating to not-for-profit
organisation.

which function without any profit motive. Their  main aim is to provide service to a
specific group or the public at large. Normally, they do not manufacture, purchase or
sell goods and may not have credit transactions. Hence they need not maintain
many books of account (as the trading concerns do) and Trading and Profit and Loss
Account. The funds raised by such organisations are credited to capital fund or
general fund. The major sources of their income usually are subscriptions from their
members donations, grants-in-aid, income from investments, etc. The main objective
of keeping records in such organisations is to meet the statutory requirement and
help them in exercising control over utilisation of their funds. They also have to prepare
the financial statements at the end of each accounting period (usually a financial
year) and ascertain their income and expenditure and the financial position, and
submit them to the statutory authority called Registrar of Societies.
The main characteristics of such organisations are:
1. Such organisations are formed for providing service to a specific group or
public at large such as education, health care, recreation, sports and so on
without any consideration of caste, creed and colour. Its sole aim is to provide
service either free of cost or at nominal cost, and not to earn profit.
2. These are organised as charitable trusts/societies and subscribers to
such organisation are called members.
3. Their affairs are usually managed by a managing/executive committee
elected by its members.
4. The main sources of income of such organisations are: (i) subscriptions
from members, (ii) donations, (iii) legacies, (iv) grant-in-aid, (v) income
from investments, etc.
5. The funds raised by such organisations through various sources are
credited to capital fund or general fund.
6. The surplus generated in the form of excess of income over expenditure
is not distributed amongst the members. It is simply added in the
capital fund.
7. The Not-for-Profit Organisations earn their reputation on the basis of
their contributions to the welfare of the society rather than on the
customers’ or owners’ satisfaction.
8. The accounting information provided by such organisations is meant for
the present and potential contributors and to meet the statutory requirement.
1.2 Accounting Records of Not-for-Profit Organisations
As stated earlier, normally such organisations are not engaged in any trading
or business activities. The main sources of their income are subscriptions from
members, donations, financial assistance from government and income from
investments. Most of their transactions are in cash or through the bank. These
2015-16

institutions are required by law to keep proper accounting records and keep
proper control over the utilization of their funds. This is why they usually keep
a cash book in which all receipts and payments are duly recorded. They also
maintain a ledger containing the accounts of all incomes, expenses, assets
and liabilities which facilitates the preparation of financial statements at the
end of the accounting period. In addition, they are required to maintain a stock
register to keep complete record of all fixed assets and the consumables.
They do not maintain any capital account. Instead they maintain capital
fund which is also called general fund that goes on accumulating due to
surpluses generated, life membership fee, donation, legacies, etc. received
from year to year. In fact, a proper system of accounting is desirable to avoid
or minimise the chances of misappropriations or embezzlement of the funds
contributed by the members and other donors.
Final Accounts or Financial Statements: The Not-for-Profit Organisations are also
required to prepare financial statements at the end of the each accounting period.
Although these organisations are non-profit making entities and they are not required
to make Trading and Profit & Loss Account but it is necessary to know whether the
income during the year was sufficient to meet the expenses or not. Not only that
they have to provide the necessary financial information to members, donors, and
contributors and also to the Registrar of Societies. For this purpose, they have to
prepare their final accounts at the end of the accounting period and the general
principles of accounting are fully applicable in their preparation as stated earlier,
the final accounts of a ‘not-for-profit organisation’ consist of the following:
(i) Receipt and Payment Account
(ii) Income and Expenditure Account, and
(iii) Balance Sheet.
The Receipt and Payment Account is the summary of cash and bank
transactions which helps in the preparation of Income and Expenditure Account
and the Balance Sheet. Besides, it is a legal requirement as the Receipts and
Payments Account has also to be submitted to the Registrar of Societies along
with the Income and Expenditure Account, and the Balance Sheet.
Income and Expenditure Account is akin to Profit and Loss Account. The
Not-for-Profit Organisations usually prepare the Income and Expenditure
Account and a Balance Sheet with the help of Receipt and Payment Account.
However, this does not imply that they do not make a trial balance. In order to
check the accuracy of the ledger accounts, they also prepare a trial balance
which facilitates the preparation of accurate Receipt and Payment Account as
well as the Income and Expenditure Account and the Balance Sheet.
In fact, if an organisation has followed the double entry system they must
prepare a trial balance for checking the accuracy of the ledger accounts and it
will also facilitate the preparation of Receipt and Payment account. Income
and Expenditure Account and the Balance Sheet.

1.3 Receipt and Payment Account
It is prepared at the end of the accounting year on the basis of cash receipts and
cash payments recorded in the cash book. It is a summary of cash and bank
transactions under various heads. For example, subscriptions received from the
members on different dates which appear on the debit side of the cash book, shall
be shown on the receipts side of the Receipt and Payment Account as one item
with its total amount. Similarly, salary, rent, electricity charges paid from time to
time as recorded on the credit side of the cash book but the total salary paid, total
rent paid, total electricity charges paid during the year appear on the payment
side  of the Receipt and Payment Account. Thus, Receipt and Payment Account
gives summarised picture of various receipts and payments, irrespective of whether
they pertain to the current period, previous period or succeeding period or whether
they are of capital or revenue nature. It may be noted that this account does not
show any non cash item like depreciation. The opening balance in Receipt and
Payment Account represents cash in hand/cash at bank which is shown on its
receipts side and the closing balance of this account represents cash in hand and
bank balance as at the end of the year, which appear on the credit side of the
Receipt and Payment Account. However, if it is bank overdraft at the end it shall
be shown on its debit side as the last item. Let us look at the cash book of Golden
Cricket Club given in the example to show how the total amount of each item of
receipt and payment has been worked out.

Fig. 1.1: Format of Receipt and Payment Account
* There will be either of the two amounts i.e., each at bank or bank overdraft, not both.
It may be noted that the receipts side of the Receipt and Payment Account gives a
list of revenue receipts (for past, current and future periods) as well as capital receipts.
Similarly, the payments side of the Receipts and Payments Account lists the Revenue
Payments (for past, current and future periods) as well as Capital Payments.
1.3.1 Salient Features
1. It is a summary of the cash book. Its form is identical with that of simple
cash book (without discount and bank columns) with debit and credit
sides. Receipts are recorded on the debit side while payments are entered
on the credit side.
2. It shows the total amounts of all receipts and payments irrespective of
the period to which they pertain . For example, in the Receipt and Payment
account for the year ending on March 31, 2015, we record the total
subscriptions received during 2014–15 including the amounts related
to the years 2013–2014 and 2015-2016. Similarly, taxes paid during
2014–15 even if they relate to the years 2013–14 and 2015–2016.
3. It includes all receipts and payments whether they are of capital nature
or of revenue nature.
4. No distinction is made in receipts/payments made in cash or through
bank. With the exception of the opening and closing balances, the total
amount of each receipt and payment is shown in this account.
5. No non-cash items such as depreciation outstanding expenses accrued
income, etc. are shown in this account.
6. It begins with opening balance of cash in hand and cash at bank (or
bank overdraft) and closes with the year end balance of cash in hand/
cash at bank or bank overdraft. In fact, the closing balance in this
account (difference between the total amount of receipts and payments)
which is usually a debit balance reflects cash in hand and cash at bank
unless there is a bank overdraft.
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
1.3.2  Steps in the preparation of Receipt and Payment Account
1. Take the opening balances of cash in hand and cash at bank and enter
them on the debit side. In case there is bank overdraft at the begining of
the year, enter the same on the credit side of this account.
2. Show the total amounts of all receipts on its debit side irrespective of
their nature (whether capital or revenue) and whether they pertain to
past, current and future periods.
3. Show the total amounts of all payments on its credit side irrespective of
their nature (whether capital or revenue) and whether they pertain to
past, current and future periods.
4. None of the receivable income and payable expense is to be entered in
this account as they do not involve inflow or outflow of cash.
5. Find out the difference between the total of debit side and the total of
credit side of the account and enter the same on the credit side as the
closing balance of cash/bank. In case, however, the total of the credit
side is more than that of the total of the debit side, show the difference on
the debit as bank overdraft and close the account.

1.4  Income and Expenditure Account
It is the summary of income and expenditure for the accounting year. It is just
like a profit and loss account prepared on accrual basis in case of the business
organisations. It includes only revenue items and the balance at the end
represents surplus or deficit.   The Income and Expenditure Account serves
the same purpose as the profit and loss account of a business organisation
does. All the revenue items relating to the current period are shown in this
account, the expenses and losses on the expenditure side and incomes and
gains on the income side of the account. It shows the net operating result in
the form of surplus (i.e. excess of income over expenditure) or deficit (i.e. excess
of expenditure over income), which is transferred to the capital fund shown in
the balance sheet.
The Income and Expenditure Account is prepared on accrual basis with the
help of Receipts and Payments Account along with additional information
regarding outstanding and prepaid expenses and depreciation etc. Hence, many
items appearing in the Receipts and Payments need to be adjusted. For example,
as shown in Example 1, (Page No. 10) subscription amount of Rs.2, 65,000 received
during the year 2014-15 appearing on the receipts side of the Receipt and Payment
Account includes receipts for the periods other than the current period. But the
subscription amount of Rs. 2,25,000 pertaining to the current year only will be
shown as income in Income and Expenditure Account for the year 2014-15.
2015-16
Accounting for Not-for-Profit Organisation
1.4.1 Steps in the Preparation of Income and Expenditure Account
Following steps may be helpful in preparing an Income and Expenditure Account
from a given Receipt and Payment Account:
1. Persue the Receipt and Payment Account thoroughly.
2. Exclude the opening and closing balances of cash and bank as they
are not an income.
3. Exclude the capital receipts and capital payments as these are to be
shown  in the Balance Sheet.
4. Consider only the revenue receipts to be shown on the income side of
Income and Expenditure Account. Some of these need to be adjusted by
excluding the amounts relating to the preceding and the succeeding
periods and including the amounts relating to the current year not yet
received.
5. Take the revenue expenses to the expenditure side of the Income and
Expenditure Account with due adjustments as per the additional
information provided relating to the amounts received in advance and
those not yet received.
6. Consider the following items not appearing in the Receipt and Payment
Account that need to be taken into account for determining the surplus/
deficit for the current year :
(a) Depreciation of fixed assets.
(b) Provision for doubtful debts, if required.
(c) Profit or loss on sale of fixed assets.
Now you will observe how the income and expenditure account is prepared
from the receipts and payments account given in example 1, on page 10.

Accounting for Not-for-Profit Organisation
1.5 Balance Sheet
‘Not-for-Profit’ Organisations prepare Balance Sheet for ascertaining the financial
position of the organisation. The preparation of their Balance Sheet is on the same
pattern as that of the business entities. It shows assets and liabilities as at the end
of the year. Assets are shown on the right hand side and the liabilities on the left
hand side. However, there will be a Capital Fund or General Fund in place of the
Capital and the surplus or deficit as per Income and Expenditure Account which
is either added to/deducted from the capital fund, as the case may be. It is also
a common practice to add some of the capitalised items like legacies, entrance
fees and life membership fees directly in the capital fund.
Besides the Capital or General Fund, there may be other funds created for
specific purposes or to meet the requirements of the contributors/donors such
as building fund, sports fund, etc. Such funds are shown separately in the
liabilities side of the balance sheet.
Some times it becomes necessary to prepare Balance Sheet as at the beginning
of the year in order to find out the opening balance of the capital/general fund.
1.5.1 Preparation of Balance Sheet
The following procedure is adopted to prepare the  Balance Sheet:
1. Take the Capital/General Fund as per the opening balance sheet and
add surplus from the Income and Expenditure Account. Further, add
entrance fees, legacies, life membership fees, etc. received during the year.
2. Take all the fixed assets (not sold/discarded/or destroyed during the
year) with additions (from the Receipts and Payments account) after
charging depreciation (as per Income and Expenditure account) and show
them on the assets side.
3. Compare items on the receipts side of the Receipts and Payments Account
with income side of the Income and Expenditure Account. This is to
ascertain the amounts of: (a) subscriptions due but not yet received:
(b) incomes received in advance; (c) sale of fixed assets made during the
year; (d) items to be capitalised (i.e. taken directly to the Balance Sheet)
e.g. legacies, interest on specific fund investment and so on.
4. Similarly compare, items on the payments side of the Receipt and
Payment Account with expenditure side of the Income and
Expenditure Account. This is to ascertain the amounts if: (a)
outstanding expenses; (b) prepaid expenses; (c) purchase of a fixed
asset during the year; (d) depreciation on fixed assets; (e) stock of
consumable items like stationery in hand; (f) Closing balance of cash
in hand and cash at bank as, and so on.
A proforma Balance Sheet is given for the proper understanding of preparing
the balance sheet.

Accounting for Not-for-Profit Organisation
1.6 Some Peculiar Items
Final accounts of the Not-for-Profit organisations are prepared on the similar
pattern as that of a business orgnisation. However, a few items of income and
expenses of such orgnisations are somewhat different in nature and need special
attention in their treatment in final accounts. They are peculiar to these
orgnisations. Some of the common peculiar items are explained as under:
Subscriptions:   Subscription is a membership fee paid by the member on annual
basis. This is the main source of income of such orgnisations. Subscription paid
by the members is shown as receipt in the Receipt and Payment Account and as
income in the Income and Expenditure Account. It may be noted that Receipt
and Payment Account shows the total amount of subscription actually received
during the year while the amount shown in Income and Expenditure Account is
confined to the figure related to the current period only irrespective of the fact
whether it has been received or not.  For example, a club received Rs. 20,000 as
subscriptions during the year 2014-15 of which Rs.3,000 relate to year
2013-14 and Rs.2,000 to 2015-16, and at the end of the year 2014-15 Rs.6,000
are still receivable. In this case, the Receipt and Payment Account will show
Rs.20,000 as receipt from subscriptions. But the Income and Expenditure
Account will show Rs. 21,000 as income from subscriptions for the year
2014-15, the calculation of which is given as below:
Subscriptions received in 2014-15

Donations:  It is a sort of gift in cash or property received from some person or
organisation. It appears on the receipts side of the Receipts and Payments
Account. Donation can be for specific purposes or for general purposes.
(i) Specific Donations: If donation received is to be utilised to achieve specified
purpose, it is called Specific Donation. The specific purpose can be an
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
extension of the existing building, construction of new computer
laboratory, creation of a book bank, etc. Such donation is to be capitalised
and shown on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet irrespective of the
fact whether the amount is big or small. The intention is to utilise the
amount for the specified purpose only.
(ii) General Donations: Such donations are to be utilised to promote the
general purpose of the organisation. These are treated as revenue receipts
as it is a regular source of income hence, it is taken to the income side of
the Income and Expenditure Account of the current year.
Legacies: It is the amount received as per the will of a deceased person. It appears
on the receipts side of the Receipt and Payment Account and is directly added to
capital fund/general fund in the balance sheet, because it is not of recurring
nature. However, legacies of a small amount may be treated as income and shown
on the income side of the Income and Expenditure Account.
Life Membership Fees: Some members prefer to pay lump sum amount as life
membership fee instead of paying periodic subscription. Such amount is treated
as capital receipt and credited directly to the capital/general fund.
Entrance Fees: Entrance fee also known as admission fee is paid only once by
the member at the time of becoming a member. In case of organisations like clubs
and some charitable institutions, is limited and the amount of entrance fees is
quite high. Hence, it is treated as non-recurring item and credited directly to
capital/general fund. However, for some organisations like educational institutions,
the entrance fees is a regular income and the amount involved may also be small.
In their case, it is customary to treat this item as a revenue receipt. However, if
there is specific instruction, it is advisable to treat the entire amount as capital
receipt and the relevant amount should be directly added to capital/general fund.
Sale of old asset: Receipts from the sale of an old asset appear in the Receipts
and Payments Account of the year in which it is sold. But any gain or loss on the
sale of asset is taken to the Income and Expenditure Account of the year. For
example, if an item furniture with a book value of Rs. 800 is sold for Rs. 700,
this amount of Rs. 700 will be shown as receipt in Receipts and Payments
Account and Rs. 100 on the expenditure side of the Income and Expenditure
Account as a loss on sale of old asset and while showing furniture in the balance
sheet Rs. 800 will be deducted from its total book value.
Sale of Periodicals: It is an item of recurring nature and shown as the income
side of the Income and Expenditure Account.
Sale of Sports Materials: Sale of sports materials (used materials like old balls,
bats, nets, etc) is the regular feature with any Sports Club. It is usually shown
as an income in the Income and Expenditure Account.

Accounting for Not-for-Profit Organisation
Payments of Honorarium: It is the amount paid to the person who is not the
regular employee of the institution. Payment to an artist for giving performance
at the club is an example of honorarium. This payment of honorarium is shown
on the expenditure side of the Income and Expenditure Account.
Endowment Fund: It is a fund arising from a bequest or gift, the income of
which is devoted for a specific purpose. Hence, it is a capital receipt and shown
on the Liabilities side of the Balance Sheet as an item of a specific purpose fund.
Government Grant: Schools, colleges, public hospitals, etc. depend upon
government grant for their activities. The recurring grants in the form of
maintenance grant is treated as revenue receipt (i.e. income of the current year)
and credited to Income and Expenditure account. However, grants such as
building grant are treated as capital receipt and transferred to the building fund
account. It may be noted that some Not-for-Profit organisations receive cash
subsidy from the government or government agencies. This subsidy is also
treated as revenue income for the year in which it is received.
Special Funds
The Not-for-Profit Organisations office create special funds for certain purposes/
activities such as 'prize funds', 'match fund' and 'sports fund', etc. Such funds
are invested in securities and the income earned on such investments is added
to the respective fund, not credited to Income and Expenditure Account.
Similarly, the expenses incurred on such specific purposes are also deducted
from the special fund. For example, a club may maintain a special fund for
sports activities. In such a situation, the interest income on sports fund
investments is added to the sports fund and all expenses on sports deducted
therefrom. The special funds are shown in balance sheet. However, if, after
adjustment of income and expenses the balance in specific or special fund is
negative, it is transferred to the debit side of the Income and Expenditure
Account or adjusted as per prescribed directions. (see Illustrations 8 and 9.)

Note:
1. Income and Expenditure Account for the current year shows interest on
investment income Rs.6,800 while Receipts and Payments Account shows
the receipts of  Rs.6,000 the difference of Rs.800 means interest on
investment has become due but not yet receivable  during the year.
2. Income and Expenditure Account shows Rs.90,000 as income from Tuition
fees. However, the Receipts and Payments Account shows Rs.10,000 as
tuition fees received for the year 2015-16 and Rs.80,000 for 2014-15. It
implies that Rs.10,000 on account of tuition fees for the year 2014-15 are
still receivable (i.e. Tuition fees are outstanding).
3. Receipt and Payment Account shows a payment of Rs.85,000 on account of
staff salaries, but the Income and Expenditure Account shows expenditure

of Rs.84,000 on account of staff salaries. It means the excess of Rs.1,000
shown in the Receipt and Payment Account may either belong to the
pervious year or the next year. Their  is no evidence that staff salaries of
Rs.1,000 was outstanding at the end of the  previous year  2013-14. This is
why this payment of Rs.1,000 has been considered  as an advance salaries
to the staff.

Summary
Difference between Profit Seeking Entities and Not-for-Profit Entities: Profit-seeking
entities undertake activities such as manufacturing trading, banking and
insurance to bring financial gain to the owners. Not-for-Profit entities exist to
provide services to the member or to the society at large. Such entities might
sometimes carry on trading activities but the profits arising therefrom are used
for further the service objectives.
Appreciation of the need for separate Accounting Treatment for Not-for-Profit
Organisations: Since not-for-profit entities are guided primarily by a service
motive, the decisions made by their managers are different from those made by
their counterparts in profit-seeking entities. Differences in the nature of
decisions implies that the financial information on which they are based, must
also be different in content and presentation.
Explanation of the nature of the Principal Financial Statements prepare by Not-for-
Profit enterprises: Not-for-Profit Organisations that maintain accounts based
on the double-entry system of accounting, generally prepare three principal
statements to fulfil their information needs. These include Receipts and
Payments Account, Income and Expenditure Account, and a Balance Sheet.
The Receipts and Payments Account is a summarised cash book which records
all cash Receipts and cash Payments without distinguishing between capital
and revenue items, and between items relating to the current year and those
relating to previous or future years.
The Income and Expenditure Account is an income statement which is prepared
to ascertain the excess of revenue income over revenue expenditure or vice
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
versa, for a particular accounting year, as a result of the entity’s overall activities.
Although it is considered to be a substitute for the Trading and Profit and Loss
Account of a profit-seeking entity, there are certain conceptual differences
between the two statements. The Balance Sheet is prepared at the end of the
entity’s accounting year to depict the financial position on that date. It includes
the Capital Fund or Accumulated Fund, special purpose funds, and current
liabilities on the left hand or liabilities side, and fixed assets and current assets
on the right hand or assets side.
Difference between the Receipt and Payment Account and the Income and
Expenditure Account: Many differences exist between the Receipt and Payment
Account and the Income and Expenditure Account which is evident from the
nature and purpose of two statements. While the former records both capital
and revenue receipts and payments relating to any accounting year, the latter
records only revenue items relating to the current accounting year. Non-cash
expenses such as depreciation on fixed assets and outstanding incomes and
expenses are shown in the latter but omitted in the former. The Receipt and
Payment Account has an opening balance while the Income and Expenditure
Account does not. The closing balance of the former account represents cash
and bank balances on the closing date while in the latter account it indicates
surplus or deficit from the activities of the enterprise.
Conversion of a Receipt and Payment Account into an Income and Expenditure
Account: This essentially involves five steps namely, (i) adjusting the revenue
receipts on the debit side to include outstanding incomes and incomes relating
to the current year received earlier and to exclude amounts received in arrears
or in advance; (ii) adjusting revenue payments on the credit side; (iii) identifying
and showing non-cash expenses and losses on the debit side of the Income
and Expenditure Account; (iv) computing and showing profits/losses from
trading and/or social activities on the credit/debit side of the Income and
Expenditure Account; and (v) ascertaining the surplus or deficit as the closing
balance of the Income and Expenditure Account.

ou have learnt about the preparation of final
accounts for a sole proprietary concern. As the
business expands, one needs more capital and
larger number of people to manage the business and
share its risks. In such a situation, people usually
adopt the partnership form of organisation.
Accounting for partnership firms has it’s own
peculiarities, as the partnership firm comes into
existence when two or more persons come together
to establish business and share its profits. On many
issues affecting distribution of profits, there may not
be any specific agreement between the partners. In
such a situation the provisions of the Indian
Partnership Act 1932 apply. Similarly, calculation
of interest on capital, interest on drawings and
maintenance of partners capital accounts have their
own peculiarities. Not only that a variety of
adjustments are required on the death of a partner
or when a new partner is admitted and so on. These
peculiar situations need specific treatment in
accounting that need to be clarified.
The present chapter discusses some basic
aspects of  partnership such as distribution of profit,
maintenance of capital accounts, etc. The treatment
of situations like admission of partner, retirement,
death and dissolution have been taken up in the
subsequent chapters.
2.1 Nature of Partnership
When two or more persons join hands to set up a
business and share its profits and losses, they are

Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
2015-16
Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
said to be in partnership. Section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 defines
partnership as the ‘relation between persons who have agreed to share the
profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all’.
Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are individually
called ‘partners’ and collectively called ‘firm’. The name under which the business
is carried is called the ‘firm’s name’. A partnership firm has no separate legal
entity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of
partnership are:
1. Two or More Persons: In order to form partnership, there should be at
least two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words,
the minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is however,
a limit on their maximum number. If a firm is engaged in the banking
business, it can have a maximum of ten partners while in case of any
other business, the maximum number of partners can be twenty.
2. Agreement: Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or
more persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The
agreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is
not necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement
is equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the
partners have a written agreement.
3. Business: The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere
co-ownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example,
if Rohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint
owners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business
of purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will
be called partners.
4. Mutual Agency: The business of a partnership concern may be carried
on by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has
two important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate
in the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a
relationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner
carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the
other partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound
by the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm.
Relationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that
there would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent.
5. Sharing of Profit: Another important element of partnership is that, the
agreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a
business. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes
partnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of
a business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
losses is important. If some persons join hands for the purpose of some
charitable activity, it will not be termed as partnership.
6. Liability of Partnership: Each partner is liable jointly with all the other
partners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm
done while he is a partner. Not only that the liability of a partner for acts
of the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also
be used for paying off the firm’s debts.
2.2 Partnership Deed
Partnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners.
The agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require
that the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document,
which contains terms of the agreement  is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It generally
contains the details about all the aspects affecting the relationship between the
partners including the objective of business, contribution of capital by each
partner, ratio in which the profits and the losses will be shared by the partners
and entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan, etc.
The clauses of partnership deed can be altered with the consent of all the
partners. The deed should be properly drafted and prepared as per the provisions
of the ‘Stamp Act’ and preferably registered with the Registrar of Firms.
Contents of the Partnership Deed
The Partnership Deed usually contains the following details:
Names and Addresses of the firm and its main business;
Names and Addresses of all partners;
Amount of capital to be contributed by each partner;
The accounting period of the firm;
The date of commencement of partnership;
Rules regarding operation of Bank Accounts;
Profit and loss sharing ratio;
Rate of interest on capital, loan, drawings, etc;
Mode of auditor’s appointment, if any;
Salaries, commission, etc, if payable to any partner;
The rights, duties and liabilities of each partner;
Treatment of loss arising out of insolvency of one or more partners;
Settlement of accounts on dissolution of the firm;
Method of settlement of disputes among the partners;
Rules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death of a partner; and
Any other matter relating to the conduct of business.
Normally, the partnership deed covers all matters affecting relationship of
partners amongst themselves. However, if there is no express agreement on
certain matters, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall apply.
2015-16
Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
2.2.1 Provisions Relevant for Accounting
The important provisions affecting partnership accounts are as follows:
(a) Profit Sharing Ratio: If the partnership deed is silent about the profit
sharing ratio, the profits and losses of the firm are to be shared equally
by partners, irrespective of their capital contribution in the firm.
(b) Interest on Capital: No partner is entitled to claim any interest on the
amount of capital contributed by him in the firm as a matter of right.
However, interest can be allowed when it is expressly agreed to by the
partners. Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed
is silent on the issue. Further the interest is payable only out of the
profits of the business and not if the firm incurs losses during the period.
(c) Interest on Drawings: No interest is to be charged on the drawings made
by the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed.
(d) Interest on Advances: If any partner has advanced some money to the
firm beyond the amount of his capital for the purpose of business, he
shall be entitled to get an interest on the amount at the rate of 6 per  cent
per annum.
(e) Remuneration for Firm’s Work: No partner is entitled to get salary or
other remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the
firm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed.
Apart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to
contract between the partners:
(i) If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the
firm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or
the firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm.
(ii) If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing
with that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all
profit made by him/her in that business.

(iv) Shyam wants interest on capital to be credited @ 6% per annum.
2. State whether the following statements are true or false:
(i) Valid partnership can be formulated even without a written agreement
between the partners;
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
(ii) Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent
for all the other partners;
(iii) Maximum number of partners in a banking firm can be 20;
(iv) Methods of settlement of dispute among the partners can’t be part of the
partnership deed;
(v) If the deed is silent, interest at the rate of 6% p.a. would be charged on the
drawings made by the partner;
(vi) Interest on partner’s loan is to be given @ 12% p.a. if the deed is silent
about the rate.
2.3 Special Aspects of Partnership Accounts
Accounting treatment for partnership firm is similar to that of a sole
proprietorship business with the exception of the following aspects:
Maintenance of Partners’ Capital Accounts;
Distribution of Profit and Loss among the partners;
Adjustments for Wrong Appropriation of Profits in the Past;
Reconstitution of the Partnership Firm; and
Dissolution of Partnership Firm.
The first three aspects mentioned above have been taken up in the following
sections of this chapter. The remaining aspects have been covered in the
subsequent chapters.
2.4 Maintenance of Capital Accounts of Partners
All transactions relating to partners of the firm are recorded in the books of the
firm through their capital accounts. This includes the amount of money brought
in as capital, withdrawal of capital, share of profit, interest on capital, interest
on drawings, partner’s salary, commission to partners, etc.
There are two methods by which the capital accounts of partners can be
maintained. These are: (i) fixed capital method, and (ii) fluctuating capital
method. The difference between the two lies in whether or not the transactions
other than addition/withdrawal of capital are recorded in the capital accounts
of the partners.
(a) Fixed Capital Method: Under the fixed capital method, the capitals of the
partners shall remain fixed unless additional capital is introduced or a
part of the capital is withdrawn as per the agreement among the partners.
All items like share of profit or loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest
on drawings, etc. are recorded in a separate accounts, called Partner’s
Current Account. The partners’ capital accounts will always show a credit
balance, which shall remain the same (fixed) year after year unless there
is any addition or withdrawal of capital. The partners’ current account
on the other hand, may show a debit or a credit balance. Thus under
this method, two accounts are maintained for each partner viz., capital
account and current account, While the partners’ capital accounts shall
2015-16
Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
always appear on the liabilities side in the balance sheet, the partners’
current account’s balance shall be shown on the liabilities side, if they
have credit balance and on the assets side, if they have debit balance.
The partner’s capital account and the current account under the fixed capital
method would appear as shown below:

(b) Fluctuating Capital Method: Under the fluctuating capital method, only
one account, i.e. capital account is maintained for each partner. All the
adjustments such as share of profit and loss, interest on capital, drawings,
interest on drawings, salary or commission to partners, etc are recorded
directly in the capital accounts of the partners. This makes the balance
in the capital account to fluctuate from time to time. That’s the reason
why this method is called fluctuating capital method. In the absence of

(i) Record necessary journal entries.
(ii) Prepare profit and loss appropriation account
(iii) Show capital accounts of the partners.
2.5 Distribution of Profit among Partners
The profits and losses of the firm are distributed among the partners in an agreed
ratio. However, if the partnership deed is silent, the firm’s profits and losses are
to be shared equally by all the partners.
You know that in the case of sole partnership the profit or loss, as ascertained
by the profit and loss account is transferred to the capital account of the
proprietor. In case of partnership, however, certain adjustments such as interest
on drawings, interest on capital, salary to partners, and commission to partners
are required to be made. For this purpose, it is customary to prepare a Profit
and Loss Appropriation Account of the firm and ascertain the final figure of
profit and loss to be distributed among the partners, in their profit sharing ratio.
2.5.1 Profit and Loss Appropriation Account
Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is merely an extension of the Profit and Loss
Account of the firm. It shows how the profits are appropriated or distributed among
the partners. All adjustments in respect of partner’s salary, partner’s commission,
interest on capital, interest on drawings, etc. are made through this account. It
starts with the net profit/net loss as per Profit and Loss Account is transfered to this
account. The journal entries for preparation of Profit and Loss Appropriation Account
and making various adjustments through it are given as follows:

1. Raju and Jai commenced business in partnership on April 1, 2015. No partnership
agreement was made whether oral or written. They contributed Rs. 4,00,000 and
Rs. 1,00,000 respectively as capitals. In addtion, Raju advanced
Rs. 2,00,000 as loan to the firm on October 1, 2015. Raju met with an accident
on July 1, 2015 and could not attend the business up to september 30, 2015.
The profit for the year ended March 31, 2016 amounted to Rs, 50,600. Disputes
have arisen between them on sharing the profits of the firm.
Raju Claims:
(i) He should be given interest at 10% p.a. on capital and so also on loan.
(ii) Profit should he distributed in the proportion of capitals.
Jai Claims:
(i) Net profit should be shared equally.
(ii) He should be allowed remuneration of Rs, 1,000 p.a. during the period of
Raju’s illness.
(iii) Interest on capital and loan should be given @ 6% p.a.
State the correct position on each issue as per the provisions of the
partnership Act. 1932.
2. Reena and Raman are partners with capitals of Rs. 3,00,000 and Rs. 1,00,000
respectively. The profit (as per Profit and Loss Account) for the year ended March
31, 2015 was Rs. 1,20,000. Interest on capital is to be allowed at 6% p.a.
Raman was entitled to a salary of Rs. 30,000 p.a. The drawings of partners
were Rs. 30,000 and 20,000. The interest on drawings to be charged to Reena
was Rs. 1,000 and to Raman, Rs. 500.
Assuming that Reena and Raman are equal partners. State their share of
profit after necessary appropriations.
2.5.2 Calculation of Interest on Capital
No interest is allowed on partners’ capitals unless it is expressly agreed among
the partners. When the Deed specifically provides for it, interest on capital is credited
to the partners at the agreed rate with reference to the time period for which the
capital remained in business during a financial year. Interest on capital is generally
provided for in two situations: (i) when the partners contribute unequal amounts
of capitals but share profits equally, and (ii) where the capital contribution is same
but profit sharing is unequal.
Interest on capital is calculated with due allowance for any addition or
withdrawal of capital during the accounting period. For example, Mohini, Rashmi
and Navin entered into partnership, bringing in Rs. 3,00,000, Rs. 2,00,000 and
Rs. 1,00,000 respectively into the business. They decided to share profits and
losses equally and agreed that interest on capital will be provided to the partners
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
@10 per cent per annum. There was no addition or withdrawal of capital by any
partner during the year. The interest on capital works out to Rs. 30,000
(10% on 30,000) for  Mohini, Rs. 20,000 (10% on 2,00,000) for Rashmi, and Rs.
10,000 (10% on 1,00,000) for Navin.
Take another case of Mansoor and Reshma who are partners in a firm and
their capital accounts showed the balance of Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,50,000
respectively on April 1, 2015. Mansoor introduced additional capital of
Rs. 1,00,000 on August 1, 2015 and Reshma brought in further capital of
Rs. 1,50,000 on October 1, 2015. Interest is to be allowed @ 6% p.a. on the
capitals. It shall be worked as follows:
For Mansoor
Rs. 2,00,000
Rs. 1,00,000
= Rs. 12,000 + Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 16,000
For Reshma
Rs. 1,50,000
Rs. 1,50,000
= Rs. 9,000+Rs. 4,500= Rs. 13,500
When there are both addition and withdrawal of capital by of partners during
a financial year, the interest on capital is calculated as follows:
(i) On the opening balance of the capital accounts of partners, interest is calculated
for the whole year;
(ii) On the additional capital brought in by any partner during the year, interest is
calculated from the date of introduction of additional capital to the last day of the
financial year.
(iii) On the amount of capital withdrawn (other than usual drawings) during the year
interest for the period from the date of withdrawal to the last day of the financial
year is calculated and deducted from the total of the interest calculated under
points: (i) and (ii) above.
Alternatively, it can be calculated with respect to the amounts remained invested
for the relevant periods.

Sometimes opening capitals of partners may not be given. In such a situation
before calculation of interest on capital the opening capitals will have to be worked
out with the help of partners’ closing capitals by marking necessary adjustments
for the additions and withdrawal of capital, drawings, share of profit or loss, if
already shown in the capital accounts the partners.
As clarified earlier, the interest on capital is allowed only when the firm has
earned profit during the accounting year. Hence, no interest will be allowed during
the year the firm has incurred net loss and if in a year, the profit of the firm is less
than the amount due to the partners as interest on capital, the  payment of interest
will be restricted to the amount of profits. In that case, the profit will be effectively
distributed in the ratio of interest on capital of each partner.

Anupam and Abhishek are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio
of 3 : 2. Their capital accounts showed balances of Rs. 1,50,000 and Rs.

capital for the year ending  December 31, 2015 in each of the following
alternatives:
(a) If the partnership deed is silent as to the payment of interest on capital
and the profit for the year is Rs. 50,000;
(b) If partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the
firm incurred a loss of Rs. 10,000 during the year;
(c) If partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the
firm earned a profit of Rs. 50,000 during the year;
(d) If the partnership deed provides for interest on capital @ 8% p.a. and the
firm earned a profit of Rs. 14,000 during the year.
Solution
(a) In the absence of a specific provision in the Deed, no interest will be paid on the
capital to the partners. The whole amount of profit will however be distributed
among the partners in their profit sharing ratio.
(b) As the firm has incurred losses during the accounting year, no interest on capital
will be allowed to any partner. The firm’s loss will however be shared by the partners
in their profit sharing ratio.

Rs. 22,000 (Rs. 50,000 – Rs. 28,000) shall be shared by the partners in their
profit sharing ratio.
(d) As the profit for the year is Rs. 14,000, which is less than the amount of
interest on capital due to partners, i.e. Rs. 28,000 (Rs. 12,000 for
Anupam and Rs. 16,000 for Abhishek), interest will be paid to the extent
of available profit i.e., Rs. 14,000. Anupam and Abhishek will be
credited with Rs. 6,000 and Rs. 8,000, respectively. Effectively this
amounts to sharing the firm’s profit in the ratio of interest on capital.

1. Rani and Suman are in partnership with capitals of Rs, 80,000 and Rs. 60,000,
respectively. During the year 2015-16, Rani withdrew Rs. 10,000 from her capital
and Suman Rs. 15,000. Profits before charging interest on capital was Rs. 50,000.
Ravi and Suman shared profits in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the amounts of
interest on their capitals @ 12% p.a. for the year ended March 31, 2016.
2. Priya and Kajal are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses in the ratio of
5:3. The balance in their fixed capital accounts, on April 1, 2015 were: Priya,
Rs. 6,00,000 and Kajal, Rs. 8,00,000. The profit of the firm for the year ended
March 31, 2016 is Rs, 1,26,000. Calculate their shares of profits: (a) when there
is no agreement in respect of interest on capital, and (b) when there is an
agreement that the interest on capital will be allowed @ 12% p.a.
2.5.3 Interest on Drawings
The partnership agreement may also provide for charging of interest on money
withdrawn out of the firm  by the partners for their personal use. As stated
earlier, no interest is charged on the drawings if there is no express agreement
among the partners about it. However if the partnership deed so provides for it,
the interest is charged at an agreed rate, for the period money remained
outstanding from the partners during an accounting year. Charging interest on
drawings discourages excessive amounts of drawings by the partners.
The calculation of interest on drawings under different situations is shown
as hereunder.
When Fixed Amounts is Withdrawn Every Month
Many a times a fixed amount of money is withdrawn by the partners, at equal
time interval, say each month or each quarter. While calculating the time period,
attention must be paid to whether the fixed amount was withdrawn at the
beginning (first day) of the month, middle of the month or at the end (last day) of
the month. If withdrawn on the first day of every month, interest on total amount
will be calculated for 6½ months; if withdrawn at the end at every month, it will
be calculated for 5½ months, and if withdrawn during the middle of the month,
it will be calculated for 6 months.
Suppose, Aashish withdrew Rs. 10,000 per month from the firm for his personal
use during the year ending March 31, 2015. The calculation of average period
and the interest on drawings, in different situations would be as follows:
(a) When the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each month:
Average Period = Total Period in Months + 1
= 12+1
2  months.
2015-16
Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
Interest on Drawings = Rs.1,20,000 8 13 1
= Rs. 5,200.
(b) When the amount is withdrawn at the end of each month
Average Period = Total period in Months – 1
5 2 months
Interest on Drawings = Rs.1,20,000
= Rs. 4,400.
(c) When money is withdrawn in the middle of the month
When money is withdrawn in the middle of the month, nothing is added or
deduced from the total period.
Average Period = Total period in Months
2  = 6 months
Interest on Drawings = Rs.1,20,000
= Rs. 4,800.
When Fixed Amount is withdrawn Quarterly
When fixed amount of money is withdrawn quarterly by partners, in such a
situation, for the purpose of calculation of interest, the total period of time is
ascertained depending on whether the money was withdrawn at the beginning
or at the end of each quarter. If the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of
each quarter, the interest is calculated on the total money withdrawn during the
year, for a period of seven and half months and if withdrawn at the and of each
quarter it will be calculated for a period of 4½ months.
Suppose Satish and Tilak are partners in a firm, sharing profits and losses
equally. During financial year 2015–2016, Satish withdrew Rs. 30,000 quarterly.
If interest is to be charged on drawings @ 8% per annum, the calculation of
average period and interest on drawings will be as follows:
(a) If the amount is withdrawn at the beginning of each quarter

Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
When Varying Amounts are Withdrawn at Different Intervals
When the partners withdraw different amounts of money at different time
intervals, the interest is calculated using the product method. Under the product
method, for each withdrawal, the money withdrawn is multiplied by the period
(usually expressed in months) for which it remained withdrawn during the
financial year. The period is calculated from the date of the withdrawal to the
last day of the accounting year. The products so calculated are totalled and
interest for 1 month at the specified rate is worked out, on the total of the
products. The calculation of interest can be explained with the help of an example.
Shahnaz withdrew the following amounts from her firm, for personal use
during the year ending March 31, 2015. Calculate interest on drawings by
product method, if the rate of interest to be charged is 7 per cent per annum.

The interest on drawings is to be charged @ 6% p.a. The books are closed on
March 31, every year.
2. Ram and Syam are partners sharing profits/losses equally. Ram withdrew
Rs. 1,000 p.m. regularly on the first day of every month during the year 2015-16
for personal expenses. If interest on drawings is charged @ 5% p.a. Calculate
interest on the drawings of Ram.
3. Verma and Kaul are partners in a firm. The partnership agreement provides
that interest on drawings should be charged @ 6% p.a. Verma withdraws
Rs. 2,000 per month starting from April 01, 2015 to March 31, 2014. Kaul
withdrew Rs, 3,000 per quarter, starting from April 01, 2015. Calculate interest
on partner’s drawings.
When Dates of Withdrawal are not specified
When the total amount withdrawn is given but the dates of withdrawals are not
specified, it is assumed that the amount was withdrawn evenly throughout the
year. For example; Shakila withdrew Rs. 60,000 from partnership firm during
the year ending March 31, 2015 and the interest on drawings is to be charged
at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. For calculation of interest, the period would
be taken as six months, which is the average period assuming, that amount is
withdrawn evenly in the middle of the month, throughout the year. The amount
of interest on drawings works out to be Rs. 2,400 as follows:
Rs.60,000
 = Rs. 2,400
2.6  Guarantee of Profit to a Partner
Sometimes a partner is admitted into the firm with a guarantee of certain
minimum amount by way of his share of profits of the firm. Such assurance
may be given by all the old partners  in a certain ratio or by any of the old
partners, individually to the new partner. The minimum guaranteed amount
shall be paid to such new partner when his share of profit as per the profit
sharing ratio is less than the guarnteed amount. For example, Madhulika and
Rakshita, who are partners in a firm decide to admit Kanishka into their firm,
giving her the guarantee of a minimum of Rs.25,000 as her share in firm’s profits.
The firm earned a profit of Rs.1,20,000 during the year and the agreed profit
sharing ratio between the partners is decided as 2:3:1. As per this ratio,
Madhulika’s share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita,
Rs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000).
The share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount.
This shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in
2015-16
Accounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts
their profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika’s share in the
deficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000.
The total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows
Madhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency
Rs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000–3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000
(Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).
If only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita
gives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by
her only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita
Rs. 55,000 (60,000–5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).

Working Notes:
The new profit sharing ratio after admission of Rahul comes to 2:1:1. As per this ratio the
share of partners in the profit comes to:
Mohit
= Rs. 1,60,000 × 2
= Rs. 80,000
Rohan
= Rs. 1,60,000 × 1
= Rs. 40,000
Rahul
= Rs. 1,60,000 ×  1
= Rs. 40,000
But, since Rahul has been given a guarantee of minimum of Rs. 50,000 as his share of
profit. The deficiency of Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 50,000 – Rs. 40,000) shall be borne by Mohit and
Rohan in the ratio in which they share profits and losses between themselves, viz. 2:1as
follows:
Mohit’s share in deficiency comes to 2/3 × Rs. 10,000 =  Rs.  6,667
Rohan’s share in deficiency comes to 1/3 × Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 3,333
Thus Mohit will get Rs. 80,000 – Rs. 6,667 = Rs. 73,333, Rohan will get
Rs. 40,000–Rs. 3,333 = Rs. 36,667 and Rahul will get Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 6,667 + Rs. 3,333 =
Rs. 50,000 in the profit of the firm.

Thus, New profit sharing ratio comes to be  2

Rs. 15,000. Deficiency of Mohanty from the guaranteed profit of Rs. 15,000 will be borne

Thus, the profits of the firm will be shared as follows.
Mahesh will get Rs. 72,000 – Rs. 7,800 = Rs. 64,200.
Dinesh will get Rs. 36,000 – Rs. 5,200 = Rs. 30,800

2.7  Past Adjustments
Sometimes a few omissions or errors in the recording of transactions or the
preparation of summary statements are found after the final accounts have been
prepared and the profits distributed among the partners. The omission may be
in respect of interest on capitals, interest on drawings, interest on partners’ loan,
partner’s salary, partner’s commission or outstanding expenses. There may also
be some changes in the provisions of partnership deed or system of accounting
having impact with retrospective effect. All these acts of omission and commission
need adjustments for correction of their impact. Instead of altering old accounts,
necessary adjustments can be made either; (a) through ‘Profit and Loss
Adjustment Account’, or (b) directly in the capital accounts of the concerned
partners. This is explained with the help of following example.
Rameez and Zaheer are equal partners. Their capitals as on April 01, 2015
were Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. After the accounts for the financial
year ending March 31, 2016 have been prepared, it is discovered that interest at
the rate of 6 per cent per annum, as provided in the partnership deed has not
been credited to the partners’ capital accounts before distribution of profit. In
this case, the interest on capital not credited to the partners’ capital accounts

(6/100 × Rs. 1,00,000) for Zaheer. Had the interest on capital been duly
provided, the firm’s profit would have reduced by Rs. 9,000. By this omission,
the whole amount of  profit as per Profit and Loss Account (without adjustment
of Rs. 9,000) has been distributed among the partners in their profit sharing
ratio, and the amounts of interest on capital have not been credited to their
capital accounts. This error can be rectified in any of the following ways;

2.8  Final Accounts
The final accounts of a partnership firm are prepared in the same way as those
prepared for a sole trading concern with just one difference which relates to the
distribution of profit among the partners. After preparing the Trading and Profit
and Loss Account, the net profit or net loss is transferred to an account called Profit
and Loss Appropriation Account as discussed earlier in this chapter. As you know,
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
all adjustments in respect of interest on capital, interest on drawings, partner’s
salary, partners’ share of profit and loss, interest on partner’s loan, etc. are made
through the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account. This is done in order to
distinguish between the results of operations of business and the distribution of
the profit among the owners. The preparation of final accounts and the Profit &
Loss Appropriation Account is clarified with the help of Illustration 13.

Summary
Definition of partnership and its essential features: Partnership is defined as
“Relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business
carried on by all or any one of them acting for all”. The essential features of
partnership are : (i) To form a partnership, there must be at least two persons;
(ii) It is created by an agreement; (iii) The agreement should be for carrying on
some legal business; (iv) sharing of profits and losses; and (v) relationship of
mutual agency among the partners.
Meaning and contents of partnership deed: A document which contains the terms
of partnership as agreed among the partners is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It
usually contains information about all aspects affecting relationship between
partners, including objective of business, contribution of capital by each partner,
ratio in which profit and losses will be shared by the partners, entitlement of
partners to interest on capital, interest on loan and the rules to be followed in
case of admission, retirement, death, dissolution, etc.
Provisions of Partnership Act 1932 applicable to accounting: If partnership deed
is silent in respect of certain aspects, the relevant provisions of the Indian
Partnership Act, 1932 become applicable. According to the Partnership Act,
the partners share profits equally, no partner is entitled to remuneration, no
interest on capital is allowed and no interest on drawings is charged. However,
if any partner has given some loan to the firm, he is entitled to interest on such
amount @ 6% per annum.
Preparation of capital accounts under fixed and fluctuating capital methods: All
transactions relating to partners are recorded in their respective capital
accounts in the books of the firm. There can be two methods of maintaining
Capital Accounts. These are; (i) fluctuating capital method, (ii) fixed capital
method. Under fluctuating capital method, all the transactions relating to a
partner are directly recorded in the capital account. Under fixed capital method,
however the amount of capital remains fixed, the transactions like interest on
capital, drawings, interest on drawings, salary, commission, share of profit or
loss are recorded in a separate account called ‘Partner’s Current Account’.
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
Distribution of profit and loss: The distribution of profits among the partners is
shown through a Profit and Loss Appropriation Account, which is merely an
extension of the Profit and Loss Account. It is usually debited with interest on
capital and salary/commission allowed to the partners, and credited with net
profit as per Profit and Loss Account and the interest on drawings. The balance
being profit or loss is distributed among the partners in the profit sharing ratio
and transferred to their respective capital accounts.
Treatment of guarantee of minimum profit to a partner: Sometimes, a partner may
be guaranteed a minimum amount by way of his share in profits. If, in any
year, the share of profits as calculated according to his profit sharing ratio is
less than the guaranteed amount, the deficiency is made good by the
guaranteeing partners’ in the agreed ratio which usually is the profit sharing
ratio. If, however, such guarantee has been given by any of them, he or they
alone shall bear the amount of deficiency.
Treatment of past adjustments: If, after the final accounts have been prepared,
some omission or commissions are noticed say in respect of the interest on
capital, interest on drawings, partner’s salary, commission, etc. necessary
adjustments can be made in the partner’s capital accounts through the Profit
and Loss Adjustment Account, to rectify the same.
Preparation of final accounts of a partnership firm: There is not much difference
in the final accounts of a sole proprietary concern and that of a partnership
firm except that in case of a partnership firm an additional account called
Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is prepared to show distribution of profit
and loss among the partners.

artnership is an agreement between two or more
persons (called partners) for sharing the profits
of a business carried on by all or any of them acting
for all. Any change in the existing agreement
amounts to reconstitution of the partnership firm.
This results in an end of the existing agreement and
a new agreement comes into being with a changed
relationship among the members of the partnership
firm and/or their composition. However, the firm
continues. The partners often resort to reconstitution
of the firm in various ways such as admission of a
new partner, change in profit sharing ratio,
retirement of a partner, death or insolvence of a
partner. In this chapter we shall have a brief idea
about all these and in detail about the accounting
implications of admission of a new partner or an on
change in the profit sharing ratio.
3.1 Modes of Reconstitution of a Partnership
Reconstitution of a partnership firm usually takes
place in any of the following ways:
Admission of a new partner: A new partner may be
admitted when the firm needs additional capital or
managerial help. According to the provisions of
Partnership Act 1932 unless it is otherwise provided
in the partnership deed a new partner can be
admitted only when the existing partners
unanimously agree for it. For example, Hari and
Haqque are partners sharing profits in the ratio of
Reconstitution of a Partnership Firm –

3:2.  On April 1, 2015 they admitted John as a new partner with 1/6 share in
profits of the firm. With this change now there are three partners of the firm and
it stand reconstituted.
Change in the profit sharing ratio among the existing partners: Sometimes the
partners of a firm may decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio. This
may happen an account of a change in the existing partners’ role in the firm. For
example, Ram, Mohan and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the
ratio of 3:2:1. With effect from April 1,2015 they decided to share profits equally
as Sohan brings in additional capital. This results in a  change in the existing
agreement leading to reconstitution of the firm.
Retirement of an existing partner: It means withdrawal by a partner from the
business of the firm which may be due to his bad health, old age or change in
business interests. In fact a partner can retire any time if the partnership is at
will. For example, Roy, Ravi and Rao are partners in the firm sharing profits in
the ratio of 2:2:1.  On account of illness, Ravi retired from the firm on March 31,
2015.  This results in reconstitution of the firm now having only two partners.
Death of a partner: Partnership may also stand reconstituted on death of a
partner, if the remaining partners decide to continue the business of the firm as
usual. For example, X,Y and Z are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio
3:2:1. X died on March 31, 2015. Y and Z decide to carry on the business sharing
future profits equally. The continuity of business by Y and Z sharing future
profits equally leads to reconstitution of the firm.
3.2 Admission of a New Partner
When firm requires additional capital or managerial help or both for the
expansion of its business a new partner may be admitted to supplement its
existing resources.  According to the Partnership Act 1932, a new partner can
be admitted into the firm only with the consent of all the existing partners unless
otherwise agreed upon. With the admission of a new partner, the partnership
firm is reconstituted and a new agreement is entered into to carry on the business
of the firm.
A newly admitted partner acquires two main rights in the firm–
1. Right to share the assets of the partnership firm; and
2. Right to share the profits of the partnership firm.
For the right to acquire share in the assets and profits of the partnership
firm, the partner brings an agreed amount of capital either in cash or in kind.
Moreover, in the case of an established firm which may be earning more profits
than the normal rate of return on its capital the new partner is required to
contribute some additional amount known as premium or goodwill. This is done
2015-16
Admission of a Partner
primarily to compensate the existing partners for loss of their share in super
profits of the firm.
Following are the other important points which require attention at the time
of admission of a new partner:
1. New profit sharing ratio;
2. Sacrificing ratio;
3. Valuation and adjustment of goodwill;
4. Revaluation of assets and Reassessment of liabilities;
5. Distribution of accumulated profits (reserves); and
6. Adjustment of partners’ capitals.
3.3 New Profit Sharing Ratio
When new partner is admitted he acquires his share in profits from the old partners.
In other words, on the admission of a new partner, the old partners sacrifice a
share of their profit in favour of the new partner.  But, what will be the share of
new partner and how he will acquire it from the existing partners is decided
mutually among the old partners and the new partner. However, if nothing is
specified as to how does the new partner acquire his share from the old partners;
it may be assumed that he gets it from them in their profit sharing ratio. In any
case, on admission of a new partner, the profit sharing ratio among the old
partners will change keeping in view their respective contribution to the profit
sharing ratio of the incoming partner.  Hence, there is a need to ascertain the new
profit sharing ratio among all the partners. This depends upon how does the
new partner acquires his share from the old partners for which there are many
possibilities. Let us understand it with the help of the following illustrations.
Illustration 1
Anil and Vishal are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2.  They admitted
Sumit as a new partner for 1/5 share in the future profits of the firm.  Calculate
new profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit.
Solution

New profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit will be 12:8:5.
Note: It has been assumed that the new partner acquired his share from old partners in
old ratio.

Das and Sinha are partners in a firm sharing profits in 4:1 ratio. They admitted
Pal as a new partner for 1/4 share in the profits, which he acquired wholly from
Das. Determine the new profit sharing ratio of the partners.
Solution
Pal’s share
Das’s new share
Old Share – Share Surrendered
Sinha’s new share
The new profit sharing ratio among Das, Sinha and Pal will be 11:4:5.
3.4 Sacrificing Ratio
The ratio in which the old partners agree to sacrifice their share of profit in
favour of the incoming partner is called sacrificing ratio.  The sacrifice by a partner
is equal to :
Old Share of Profit – New Share of Profit
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
As stated earlier, the new partner is required to compensate the old partner’s
for their loss of share in the super profits of the firm for which he brings in an
additional amount known as premium or goodwill. This amount is shared by
the existing partners in the ratio in which they forego their shares in favour of
the new partner which is called sacrificing ratio.
The ratio is normally clearly given as agreed among the partners which could
be the old ratio, equal sacrifice, or a specified ratio. The difficulty arises where
the ratio in which the new partner acquires his share from the old partners is
not specified. Instead, the new profit sharing ratio is given. In such a situation,
the sacrificing ratio is to be worked out by deducting each partner’s new share
from his old share. Look at the illustrations 6 to 8 and see how sacrificing ratio
is calculated in such a situation.
Illustration 6
Rohit and Mohit are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3. They
admit Bijoy as a new partner for 1/7 share in the profit.  The new profit sharing
ratio will be 4:2:1. Calculate the sacrificing ratio of Rohit and Mohit.
Solution
Rohit’s old share
Rohit’s new share
Rohit’s sacrifice
Mohit’s old share
Mohit’s new share
Mohit’s sacrifice
Sacrificing ratio among Rohit and Mohit will be 3:5.
Illustration 7
Amar and Bahadur are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They
admitted Mary as a new partner for 1/4 share. The new profit sharing ratio
between Amar and Bahadur will be 2:1. Calculate their sacrificing ratio.

share in the future profits. The new profit sharing ratio will be:
X and Y share profits in the ratio of 3:2. Z was admitted as a partner who sets
1/5 share. New profit sharing ratio, if Z acquires 3/20 from X and 1/20 from
Y would be:
9 : 7 : 4

(c) 2 : 1
(d) 3 : 2.
3.5 Goodwill
Goodwill is also one of the special aspects of partnership accounts which requires
adjustment (also valuation if not specified) at the time of reconstitution of a firm
viz., a change in the profit sharing ratio, the admission of a partner or the
retirement or death of a partner.
3.5.1 Meaning of Goodwill
Over a period of time, a well-established business develops an advantage of
good name, reputation and wide business connections. This helps the business
to earn more profits as compared to a newly set up business. In accounting, the
monetary value of such advantage is known as “goodwill”.
It is regarded as an intangible asset. In other words, goodwill is the value of
the reputation of a firm in respect of the profits expected in future over and above
the normal profits. It is generally observed that when a person pays for goodwill,
2015-16
Admission of a Partner
he/she pays for something, which places him in the position of being able to earn
super profits as compared to the profit earned by other firms in the same industry.
In simple words, goodwill can be defined as “the present value of a firm’s
anticipated excess earnings” or as “the capitalised value attached to the differential
profit capacity of a business”. Thus, goodwill exists only when the firm earns super
profits. Any firm that earns normal profits or is incurring losses has no goodwill.
3.5.2
Factors Affecting the Value of Goodwill
The main factors affecting the value of goodwill are as follows:
1. Nature of business: A firm that produces high value added products or
having a stable demand is able to earn more profits and therefore has
more goodwill.
2. Location: If the business is centrally located or is at a place having heavy
customer traffic, the goodwill tends to be high.
3. Efficiency of management:  A well-managed concern usually enjoys the
advantage of high productivity and cost efficiency. This leads to higher
profits and so the value of goodwill will also be high.
4. Market situation:  The monopoly condition or limited competition enables
the concern to earn high profits which leads to higher value of goodwill.
5. Special advantages:  The firm that enjoys special advantages like import
licences, low rate and assured supply of electricity, long-term contracts
for supply of materials, well-known collaborators, patents, trademarks,
etc. enjoy higher value of goodwill.
3.5.3 Need for Valuation of Goodwill
Normally, the need for valuation of goodwill arises at the time of sale of a business.
But, in the context of a partnership firm it may also arise in the following
circumstances:
1. Change in the profit sharing ratio amongst the existing partners;
2. Admission of new partner;
3. Retirement of a partner;
4. Death of a partner; and
5. Dissolution of a firm involving sale of business as a going concern.
6. Amalgamation of partnership firms.
3.5.4
Methods of Valuation of Goodwill
Since goodwill is an intangible asset it is very difficult to accurately calculate its
value. Various methods have been advocated for the valuation of goodwill of a
partnership firm. Goodwill calculated by one method may differ from the goodwill
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
calculated by another method. Hence, the method by which goodwill is to be
calculated, may be specifically decided between the existing partners and the
incoming partner.
The important methods of valuation of goodwill are as follows:
1. Average Profits Method
2. Super Profits Method
3. Capitalisation Method
3.5.4.1
Average Profits Method
Under this method, the goodwill is valued at agreed number of ‘years’ purchase
of the average profits of the past few years. It is based on the assumption that a
new business will not be able to earn any profits during the first few years of its
operations. Hence, the person who purchases a running business must pay in
the form of goodwill a sum which is equal to the profits he is likely to receive for
the first few years. The goodwill, therefore, should be calculated by multiplying
the past average profits by the number of years during which the anticipated
profits are expected to accrue.
For example, if the past average profits of a business works out at Rs. 20,000
and it is expected that such profits are likely to continue for another three years,
the value of goodwill will be Rs. 60,000 (Rs. 20,000 × 3),
Illustration 9
The profit for the five years of a firm are as follows – year 2010 Rs. 4,00,000;
year 2011 Rs. 3,98,000; year 2012 Rs. 4,50,000; year 2013 Rs. 4,45,000 and
year 2014 Rs. 5,00,000. Calculate goodwill of the firm on the basis of 4 years
purchase of 5 years average profits.

2015-16
Admission of a Partner
The above calculation of goodwill is based on the assumption that no change
in the overall situation of profits is expected in the future.
The above illustration is based on simple average. Sometimes, if there exists
an increasing on decreasing trend, it is considered to be better to give a higher
weightage to the profits to the recent years than those of the earlier years. Hence,
it is a advisable to work out weighted average based on specified weights like 1,
2, 3, 4 for respective year’s profit. However, weighted average should be used
only if specified. (See illustrations 10 and 11).

3.5.4.2
Super Profits Method
The basic assumption in the average profits (simple or weighted) method of
calculating goodwill is that if a new business is set up, it will not be able to
earn any profits during the first few years of its operations. Hence, the person
who purchases an existing business has to pay in the form of goodwill a sum
equal to the total profits he is likely to receive for the first ‘few years’. But it is
contended that the buyer’s real benefit does not lie in total profits; it is limited
to such amounts of profits which are in excess of the normal return on capital
employed in similar business. Therefore, it is desirable to value, goodwill on
the basis of the excess profits and not the actual profits. The excess of actual
profits over the normal profits is termed as super profits.
Normal Profit  =  Capital Employed × Normal Rate of Return
Suppose an existing firm earns Rs. 18,000 on the capital of Rs. 1,50,000
and the normal rate of return is 10%. The Normal profits will work out at
Rs. 15,000 (1,50,000 × 10/100). The super profits in this case will be Rs. 3,000
(Rs. 18,000 – 15,000). The goodwill under the super profit method is ascertained
by multiplying the super profits by certain number of years’ purchase. If, in the
above example, it is expected that the benefit of super profits is likely to be
available for 5 years in future, the goodwill will be valued at Rs. 15,000
(3,000 × 5). Thus, the steps involved under the method are:
1. Calculate the average profit,
2. Calculate the normal profit on the capital employed on the basis of the
normal rate of return,
3. Calculate the super profits by deducting normal profit from the average
profits, and
4. Calculate goodwill by multiplying the super profits by the given number
of years’ purchase.

The books of a business showed that the capital employed on December
31, 2014, Rs. 5,00,000 and the profits for the last five years were: 2010–

2014-Rs. 85,000. You are required to find out the value of goodwill based
on 3 years purchase of the super profits of the business, given that the
normal rate of return is 10%.

Illustration 13
The capital of the firm of Anu and Benu is Rs. 1,00,000 and the market rate of
interest is 15%.  Annual salary to partners is Rs. 6,000 each.  The profits for the
last 3 years were Rs. 30,000; Rs. 36,000 and Rs. 42,000.  Goodwill is to be
valued at 2 years purchase of the last 3 years’ average super profits. Calculate
the goodwill of the firm.
Solution
Interest on capital
= 1,00,000× 15
= Rs.   15,000…………(i)

= Rs. 9,000
Goodwill
= Super Profit × No of years’ purchase
= Rs. 9,000 × 2
= Rs. 18,000
3.5.4.3 Capitalisation Methods
Under this method the goodwill can be calculated in two ways: (a) by capitalizing
the average profits, or (b) by capitalizing the super profits.
(a) Capitalisation of Average Profits: Under this method, the value of goodwill
is ascertained by deducting the actual capital employed (net assets) in the
business from the capitalized value of the average profits on the basis of
normal rate of return.  This involves the following steps:
(i) Ascertain the average profits based on the past few years’ performance.
(ii) Capitalize the average profits on the basis of the normal rate of return to
ascertain the capitalised value of average profits as follows:
Average Profits × 100/Normal Rate of Return
(iii) Ascertain the actual capital employed (net assets) by deducting outside
liabilities from the total assets (excluding goodwill).
Capital Employed = Total Assets (excluding goodwill) – Outside Liabilities
(iv) Compute the value of goodwill by deducting net assets from the
capitalised value of average profits, i.e. (ii) – (iii).
Illustration 14
A business has earned average profits of Rs. 1,00,000 during the last few years
and the normal rate of return in a similar business is 10%. Ascertain the value
of goodwill by capitalisation average profits method, given that the value of net
assets of the business is Rs. 8,20,000.
Solution
Capitalised Value of Average Profits
Rs.1,00,000
= Rs. 10,00,000
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
Goodwill
= Capitalised value – Net Assets
= Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 8,20,000
= Rs.1,80,000
(b) Capitalisation of Super Profits: Goodwill can also be ascertained by capitalising the
super profit directly. Under this method there is no need to work out the capitalised
value of average profits. It involves the following steps.
(i) Calculate capital employed of the firm, which is equal to total assets minus outside
liabilities.
(ii) Calculate normal profits on capital employed.
(iii) Calculate average profit for past years, as specified.
(ii) Calculate super profits by deducting normal profits from average profits.
(iii) Multiply the super profits by the required rate of return multiplier, that is,
Goodwill = Super Profits × 100 Normal Rate of Return
In other words, goodwill is the capitalised value of super profits. The amount of goodwill
worked out by this method will be exactly the same as calculated by capitalising the
average profits.
For example, using the data given in illustration 14 where the average profits are Rs.
1,00,000 and the normal profits are Rs. 82,000 (10% of Rs. 8,20,000), the super profits
worked out as Rs. 18,000 (Rs. 1,00,000 – Rs. 82,000), the goodwill will be Rs. 18,000 ×
10  = Rs. 1,80,000.
Illustration 15
1. The goodwill of a firm is to be worked out at three years’ purchase of the
average profits of the last five years which are as follows:
Years
Profits (Loss)
(Rs.)
10,000
15,000
4,000
(5,000)
6,000
2. The capital employed of the firm is Rs. 1,00,000 and normal rate of return
is 8%, the average profits for last 5 years are Rs. 12,000 and goodwill is
to be worked out at 3 years’ purchase of super profits,
3. Rama Brothers earn an average profit of Rs. 30,000 with a capital of
Rs. 2,00,000. The normal rate of return in the business is 10%. Using
capitalisation of super profits method work out the value the goodwill of
the firm.

Solution
1. Total Profits = Rs. 10,000 + Rs. 15,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 6,000 – Rs. 5,000
= Rs. 30,000
Average Profits = Rs. 30,000/5
=  Rs. 6,000
Goodwill = Average Profits × 3
=  Rs. 6,000 × 3 = Rs.18,000
2. Average Profit
=  Rs. 12,000
Normal Profit
=  Rs.1,00,000 ×
100   =  Rs. 8,000
Super Profit=Average Profit – Normal profit  =  Rs. 12,000 – Rs. 8,000
=  Rs. 4,000
Goodwill=Super Profit × 3
=  Rs. 4,000 × 3  =  Rs. 12,000
3. Normal Profit= Rs. 2,00,000 × 10/100  =  Rs. 20,000
Super Profit = Average Profit – Normal Profit  =  Rs. 30,000 – Rs. 20,000
=  Rs. 10,000
Goodwill=Super Profit × 100/Normal Rate of Return
=  10,000 × 100/10 = Rs. 1,00,000.
3.5.5
Treatment of Goodwill
As stated earlier, the incoming partner who acquires his share in the profits of
the firm from the existing partners brings in some additional amount to
compensate them for loss of their share in super profits. It is termed as his share
of goodwill (also called premium). Alternatively he may agree that goodwill
account be raised in the books of the firm by giving the necessary credit to the
old partners. Thus, when a new partner is admitted, goodwill can be treated in
two ways: (1) By Premium Method, and (2) By Revaluation Method.
3.5.5.1 Premium Method
This method is followed when the new partner pays his share of goodwill in
cash.  The amount of premium brought in by the new partner is shared by the
existing partners in their ratio of sacrifice.  If this amount is paid to the old
partners directly (privately) by the new partner, no entry is made in the books of
the firm.  But, when the amount is paid through the firm,  which is generally the
case, the following journal entries are passed:
Cash A/c
To Goodwill A/c
(Amount brought by new partner as premium)
Goodwill A/c
To Existing Partners Capital A/c (Individually)
(Goodwill distributed among the existing
partners in their sacrificing ratio)
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
Alternatively, it is credited to the new partner’s capital account and then
adjusted in favour of the existing partners in their sacrificing ratio.  In that case
the journal entries will be as follows:
Cash A/c
To New Partner’s Capital A/c
(Amount brought by new partner for his
share of goodwill)
New Partner’s Capital A/c
To Existing Partner’s Capital A/cs (Individually)
(Goodwill brought by new partners distributed
among the existing partners in their
sacrificing ratio)
If the partners decide that the amount of premium credited to their capital
accounts should be retained in business, there is no need to pass any additional
entry.  If, however, they decide to withdraw their amounts, (in full or in part) the
following additional entry will be passed:
Existing Partner’s Capital A/c (Individually)
To Cash A/c
(The amount of goodwill withdrawn by the
existing partners)

When goodwill already exists in books: The above treatment of goodwill was
based on the assumption that there was no goodwill account in the books of the
firm. However, It is quite possible that when a new partner brings in his share of
goodwill in cash, some amount of goodwill already exists in books. In that case,
after crediting the old partners by the amount of goodwill brought in by the new
partner, the existing goodwill must be written off by debiting the old partners in
their old profit sharing ratio. But, if it is decided that the goodwill may continue
to appear in the books at its old value, the amount to be brought in by new
partner will have to be proportionately reduced i.e.,  He will be required to bring
cash only for this share of the excess of the agreed value of goodwill over the
amount of goodwill already appearing in books. For example,
In illustration 17, the goodwill of the firm is valued at Rs. 20,000 and Ajay
who is admitted to 1/4 share in its profits, brings in Rs. 5,000 as his share of
goodwill.  Suppose, goodwill already appeared in books at Rs. 10,000 and there
is no decision to retain it. In that case, after crediting Vijay and Sanjay for the
amount of goodwill brought in by Ajay, the following additional journal entry
shall be recorded for writing off the existing amount of goodwill.

In case, however, the partners decide to maintain the Goodwill Account as it
is, the new partner is required to bring in as his share of goodwill only in respect of
the difference between its total value and the book value.  In other words, Ajay will
be required to bring in Rs. 2,500 only [1/4 of Rs. 10,000 (Rs 20,000 – Rs. 10,000)].
Which will be credited to old partners in their sacrificing ratio, and no entry will
be recorded for writing off the existing amount of goodwill.

profit in favour of Venkat in the old ratio i.e., 3:2.
3.5.5.2 Revaluation Method
This method is followed when the new partner does not bring in his share of
goodwill in cash.  In such a situation, the goodwill account is raised in the
books of account by crediting the old partners in the old profit sharing ratio.
When goodwill account is to be raised in the books of account there are two
possibilities,
(a) No goodwill appears in books at the time of admission, and
(b) Goodwill already exists in books at the time of admission.
2015-16
Admission of a Partner
(a) When no goodwill exists in the books: When no goodwill exists in the books
at the time of the admission of a new partner, the goodwill account must be
raised at its full value.  This can be done by debiting goodwill account with its
full value and crediting the old partners’ capital accounts in their profit sharing
ratio.  The journal entry will be:
Goodwill A/c
To Old Partners’ Capitals A/c (individually)
(Goodwill raised at full value in the old ratio)
The goodwill thus raised shall appear in the balance sheet of the firm at its
full value.

Sometimes, a partner may bring in a part of his share of goodwill. In such a
situation, after distributing the amount brought in for goodwill among the old
partners in their sacrificing ratio, the goodwill account is raised in the books
based on the portion of premium not brought by the new partner. For example,
Pooja and Sandeep are partners sharing profits in ratio of 3:3. They admit Tushar
as a new partner for 13 share in profits. Tushar is to bring in Rs. 30,000 as his
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
share of goodwill as the total value of goodwill is estimated at Rs. 90,000. But
he brings Rs. 15,000 only (half of what is due) on this account. In this case, after
due credit for Rs. 15,000 to Pooja’s and Sandeep’s capital accounts in their
sacricifing ratio, goodwill account will be raised by Rs. 45,000 (half of its total
value) by crediting their old profit sharing ratio.
(b) When goodwill already exists in the books : If the books already show some
balance in the Goodwill Account, the adjustment for goodwill in the old partner’s
capital accounts shall be made only for the difference between the agreed value
of goodwill and the amount of goodwill appearing in books.
The amount of goodwill appearing in the books may be less than its agreed
value or it may be more than the agreed value.  If it is less than the agreed value,
the difference between the agreed value of goodwill and the amount of goodwill
appearing in the books will be debited to goodwill account and credited to old
partner’s capital accounts in their old profit sharing ratio.  If, however, it is more
than the agreed value, the difference will be debited to the old partners’ capital
accounts in their old profits sharing ratio and credited to the goodwill account.
Thus, the journal entries will be as under:
(a) When the value of goodwill appearing in the books is less than the agreed
value.
Goodwill A/c

(Goodwill raised to its agreed value)

Normally, when goodwill is raised in the books of the firm, it will be shown in
the balance sheet at its agreed value.  If, however, the partners decide that after
necessary adjustments have been made in the old partners’ capital accounts,
the goodwill should not appear in the firm’s balance sheet, then it has to be
written off. This is done by crediting the goodwill account and debiting the capital
accounts of all the partners (including the new partner) in the new profit sharing
ratio. The net effect of such treatment will be that the new partner’s capital
account stands debited to the extent of his share of goodwill and the old partners
capital accounts credited in the ratio of their sacrifice, and the goodwill shows
nil balance.

Sometimes, the partners may decide not to show goodwill account anywhere
in books (not even in the journal and ledger).  In that case, for adjustment of
goodwill, just one entry can be passed by debiting the new partner’s capital
account with his share of goodwill and crediting the old partners’ capital accounts
in their ratio of sacrifice.  If in Illustration 21 we were to treat goodwill in this
manner, the entry for goodwill would have been as follows:

The above entry has the same effect on partners’ capital accounts as journal
entries (2) and (3).
Box I
Accounting standard 10 (AS–10) on “Accounting for Fixed Assets” in its Para 16
states that Goodwill, in general, is recorded in the books only when some
consideration in money or money’s worth has been paid for it. Whenever a business
is acquired for a price (payable either in cash or in shares or otherwise) which is
excess of the net assets taken over, the excess is termed as goodwill’. Goodwill
arises from business connections, trade name or reputation of an enterprise or
from other intangible benefits enjoyed by an enterprise.
As a matter of financial prudence, goodwill is written off over a period. However,
many enterprises do not write off goodwill and retain it as an asset.
In view of the provision in para 16 of the Accounting Standard 10 (AS-10),
some experts feel that in case of admission, retirement or death of a partner or a
change in profit sharing ratio among the partners, goodwill cannot be raised in
the books of the firm, and all entries relating to goodwill on such occasions
should be recorded in books of the firm directly through the partners’ capital
accounts only. This is stretching the interpretation of AS–10 too far. What this
accounting standard implies is that normally goodwill should not be brought
into books unless it is paid for, and whenever it is recorded it should be
written- off over a period. Hence, crediting goodwill account with the amount
brought in by the incoming partner for his share of goodwill and then transferring
it to old partners’ capital accounts by debiting goodwill account is quite in order.
Similarly, when the incoming partner is unable to bring in the necessary amount
for his share of goodwill, raising goodwill account at its agreed value by crediting
the old partners in then old profit sharing ratio and then writing it off
immediately by debiting it to all the partners (including the new partner) in the
new profit sharing ratio is also acceptable as effectively it is tent amount to purchase of
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
goodwill because new partner’s capital account balance stands reduced by his
share of goodwill. The same logic equally implies to the adjustments made for
raising the goodwill account to its goodwill account when it already appears in
the balance sheet. What is important is that in the normal course of raising
goodwill as an asset should be avoided of and, if and when it is brought in to
books, it should be written off in the shortest possible period.

one-third share in the profit. C brings in Rs. 60,000 as his capital.  Based on the
amount brought in by C and his share in profit, the total capital of the newly
constituted firm works out to be Rs.1,80,000 (Rs. 60,000 × 3). But the actual
total capital of A, B and C works out as Rs. 1,50,000 (Rs. 45,000 + Rs. 45,000
+ Rs. 60,000). Hence, it can be inferred that the difference is on account of goodwill
i.e., Rs. 30,000 (Rs. 1,80,000 – Rs. 1,50,000). Which is to be shared equally (old
ratio) by A and B. This shall raise their capital accounts to Rs. 60,000 each and
total capital of the firm to Rs. 1,80,000. Alternatively, if goodwill account is not
to be raised, C’s capital account can be debited by Rs. 10,000 (his share of
goodwill) and A and B’s Capital accounts credited by Rs. 5,000 each, and firm’s
total capital remains Rs. 50,000.

fund and/or Profit and Loss Account balance. The new  partner is not entitled to
have any share in such accumulated profits.  These are distributed among the
partners by transferring it to their capital accounts in old profit sharing ratio.
Similarly, if there are some accumulated losses in the form of a debit balance of
profit and loss account appearing in the balance sheet of the firm.
A remote possibility, the same should also be transferred to the old partners’
capital accounts (see Illustration 23).

3.7 Revaluation of Assets and Reassessment of Liabilities
At the time of admission of a new partner, it is always desirable to ascertain
whether the assets of the firm are shown in books at their current values. In
case the assets are overstated or understated, these are revalued. Similarly, a
reassessment of the liabilities is also done so that these are brought in the books
at their correct values.  At times there may also be some unrecorded assets and
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
liabilities of the firm. These also have to be brought into the books of the firm.
For this purpose the firm has to prepare the Revaluation Account. The gain or
loss on revaluation of each asset and liability is transferred to this account and
finally its balance is transferred to the capital accounts of the old partners in
their old profit sharing ratio.  In other words, the  revaluation account is credited
with increase in the value of each asset and decrease in its liabilities because it
is a gain and is debited with decrease in the value of assets and increase in its
liabilities is debited to revaluation account because it is a loss. Similarly
unrecorded assets are credited and unrecorded liabilities are debited to the
revaluation account. If the revaluation account finally shows a credit balance
then it indicates net gain and if there is a debit balance then it indicates net loss.
Which will be transferred to the capital accounts of the old partners in old ratio.
The journal entries recorded for revaluation of assets and reassessment of
liabilities are as follows:

Admission of a Partner
Do It Yourself
Aslam, Jackab, Hari are equal partners with capitals of Rs. 1,500, Rs. 1,750
and Rs. 2,000 respectively.  They agree to admit Satnam into equal partnership
upon payment in cash of Rs. 1,500 for one-fourth share of the goodwill and
Rs. 1,800 as his capital, both sums to remain in the business.  The liabilities
of the old firm amount Rs. 3,000 and the assets, apart from cash, consist of
Motors Rs. 1,200,  Furniture Rs. 400, Stock Rs. 2,650, Debtors of Rs. 3,780.
The Motors and Furniture were revalued at Rs. 950 and Rs. 380 respectively,
and the depreciation written-off.  Ascertain cash in hand and prepare the
balance sheet of the firm after Satnam’s admission.
Benu and Sunil are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2 on April 1,
2003. Ina was admitted for 1/4 share who paid Rs. 2,00,000 as capital and
Rs. 1,00,000 for premium in cash. At the time of admission, general reserve
amounting to Rs. 1,20,000 and profit and loss account amounting to
Rs. 60,000 appeared on the asset side of the balance sheet.
Required: Record necessary journal entries to record the above transactions.
Ashoo and Rahul are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3. Gaurav was
admitted for 1/5 share and was asked to contribute proportionate capital and
Rs. 4,000 for premium (goodwill). The Capitals of Ashoo and Rahul, after all
adjustments relating to revaluation, goodwill etc., worked out to be Rs. 45,000
and Rs. 35,000 respectively.
Required: Calculate New Profit sharing ratio, capital to be brought in by Gaurav
and record necessary journal entries for the same.
3.8 Adjustment of Capitals
Sometimes, at the time of admission, the partners agree that their capitals should
also be adjusted so as to be proportionate to their profit sharing ratio.  In such
a situation, if the capital of the new partner is given, the same can be used as a
base for calculating the new capitals of the old partners. The capitals thus
ascertained should be compared with their old capitals after all adjustments
relating to goodwill reserves and revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc. have
been made; and then the partner whose capital falls short, will bring in the
necessary amount to cover the shortage and the partner who has a surplus,
will withdraw the excess amount of capital. (See Illustration 26)
Illustration 26
A and B are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 2:1. C is admitted into the
firm for 1/4 share of profits. C brings in Rs. 20,000 in respect of his capital. The
capitals of old partners A and B, after all adjustments relating to goodwill,
revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc., are Rs. 45,000 and Rs. 15,000
respectively.  It is agreed that partners’ capitals should be according to the new
profit sharing ratio.
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
Determine the new capitals of A and B and record the necessary journal
entries assuming that the partner whose capital falls short, brings in the amount
of deficiency and the partner who has an excess, withdraws the excess amount.
Solution
1. Calculation of new profit sharing ratio: Assuming the new partner C quires
his share from A and B in their old profit sharing ratio, i.e 2:1.,
Total Share
C’s Share
Remaining Shares
A’s New Share
B’s New Share
C’s New Share
Thus, new profit sharing ratio between A,B and C is 6:3:3 or 2:1:1.
2. Required Capital of A and B
C’s capital (who has 1/4 share in profits) is Rs. 20,000. B’s new share in profits
1/4. Hence his capital will also be Rs. 20,000. A’s new share is 2/4 which is double of
C’s share.  Hence his capital will be Rs. 40,000.
Alternatively, based on C’s capital, the total capital of the firm works out at
Rs. 80,000 (4/1 × Rs.20,000). Hence, based on their share in profits, the capital of A and
B will be:
A’s capital
of  80,000  =  Rs. 40,000
B’s capital
of  80,000  =  Rs. 20,000
The capital of A and B after all adjustments have been made, are Rs. 45,000
and Rs. 15,000 respectively.  Hence, A will withdraw Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 45,000–
Rs.40,000) from the firm whereas B will contribute additional amount of
Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 20,000–Rs.15,000). The journal entries will be :

Sometimes, the total capital of the firm may clearly be specified and it is
agreed that the capital of each partner should be proportionate to his share in
profits.  In such a situation each partner’s capital (including the new partner’s
capital to be brought by him) is calculated on the basis of his share in profits.
By bringing in additional amount or withdrawal of excess amount, the final
capital of each partner can be brought up to the required level.
It may be noted that subject to agreement among the partners, surplus or
deficiency in each old partners’ capital accounts can also be taken care of simply
by transfer to their respective current accounts. (See Illustration 27)
Illustration 27
A, B and C are partners in a firm sharing profits the ratio of 3:2:1. D is admitted
into the firm for 1/4 share in profits, which he gets as 1/8 from A and 1/8 from
B. The total capital of the firm is agreed upon as Rs. 1,20,000 and D is to bring
in cash equivalent to 1/4 of this amount as his capital. The capitals of other
partners are also to be adjusted in the ratio of their respective shares in profits.
The capitals of A, B and C after all adjustments are Rs. 40,000, Rs. 35,000 and
Rs. 30,000 respectively. Calculate the new capitals of A,B and C, and record the
necessary journal entries.
Solution
Calculation of new profit sharing ratio:
C will continue to get 1/6 as his share in the profits.
Thus, the new profit sharing ratio between A,B,C and D will be:
24   or  9:5:4:6
Required capitals of all partners:
A’s Capital
= Rs. 1,20,000
=  Rs. 45,000
B’s Capital
= Rs. 1,20,000

= Rs. 1,20,000
=  Rs. 20,000
D’s Capital
= Rs. 1,20,000
=  Rs. 30,000
Hence, A will bring in Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 45,000 – Rs. 40,000), B will withdraw
Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 35,000 – Rs. 25,000), C will withdraw Rs. 10,000  (Rs. 30,000
– Rs, 20,000) and D will bring in Rs. 30,000. Alternatively, the current
accounts can be opened and the amounts to be brought in or withdrawn by
A, B and C will be transferred to their respective current accounts subject to

New Profit Sharing Ratio
Since nothing is given as to how C acquired his share from A and B. It is assumed that A
and B, between themselves continue to share the profit in the old ratio of 2:1.
C’s Share of Profits =  1
Remaining Share
A’s New Share
3   of  3
B’s New Share
3   of  3
Thus, new profit sharing ratio between A, B and C is 2:1:1
New Capitals of A and B
C’s capital is Rs 30,000 and his share of profits is 1/4. Based on C’s capital, the total
capital of the firm will work out at Rs 1,20,000 (4/1 × 30,000) and the  respective capitals
of A and B will be as follows :
A’s Capital
of 1,20,000  =  Rs. 60,000
B’s Capital
=   1
of 1,20,000  =  Rs. 30,000

The new profit sharing ratio will be:

The new ratio is 33 : 22 : 20.
3.9 Change in Profit Sharing Ratio among the existing Partners
Sometimes, the partners of a firm decide to change their existing profit sharing
ratio without any admission or retirement of a partner. This results in a gain of
additional share in future profits of the firm for some partners while a loss of a
part thereof for other partners. For example, A, B and C are partners in a firm
sharing profits in the ratios of 8:5:3 It is felt that A will no more be able to
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
actively participate in the affairs of the firm. Hence, with effect from
April 1, 2007, they decided that, in future they will share the profits in the
ratio of 5 : 6 : 5. This results in A losing 316
 share in profits while B
and C gaining 116
 and 216
. In such a situation, first of
all, the loss and gain in the value of goodwill (if any) will have to be adjusted.
This is done by raising goodwill at its full value in the MD profit sharing ratio
and then writing it off in the new ratio. Alternatively, losing partners can be
credited and gaining partners debited with appropriate amounts without
goodwill account appearing in the books, as explained earlier in the context of
the admission of a new partners.
Any change, in the profit sharing ratio, like admission of partner, may also
involve adjustments in respect of revaluation of assets and liabilities, transfer of
accumulated profit and losses to partners' capital accounts in the old profit
sharing ratio and adjustment of partners' capitals, if specified, so as to make
them proportionate to the new profit sharing ratio. All this is done in the same
way as in case of admission of a partner.

Summary
Matters requiring adjustments at the time of admission of a partner: Various matters
which need adjustments in the books of firm at the time of admission of a new
partner are : goodwill, revaluation of assets and liabilities, reserves and other
accumulated profits and losses and the capitals of the old partners (if agreed).
Determining the new profit sharing ratio and calculating sacrificing ratio: The new
partner acquires his share in profits from the old partners. This reduces the
old partner’s share in profits. Hence, the problem of determining the new profit
sharing ratio simply involves the determination of old partner’s new share in
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
the profits of the reconstituted firm. Given the new partner’s share in profits
and the ratio, in which he acquires it from the old partners, the new share of
each old partner shall be worked out by deducting his share of sacrifice from
his old share in profits. The ratio in which the old partners have agreed to
sacrifice their shares in profit in favour of the new partner is called the
sacrificing ratio. It is usually same as the old profit sharing ratio. However,
based on the agreement it can be different also.
Treatment of Goodwill: Goodwill is an intangible asset and belonges to its owner
at a point of time. On the admission of a new partner the goodwill of the firm
belongs to the old partners. It means that on the admission of a new partner
some adjustments must be made into the capital accounts of the old  partners
for goodwill so that the new partner will not acquire a share in that profit
which the firm earns because of its goodwill earned before admission without
making any payment for the same. The amount that the new partner pays for
goodwill is called goodwill. From accounting point of view the firm may have to
face different situations for the treatment of goodwill at the time of admission of
a partner. The amount of premium brought in by the new partner is shared by
old partners in the ratio of sacrifice. In case the new partner fails to bring his
share of premium for goodwill in cash than the capital account of the new
partner is debited for his share of premium of goodwill and the old partners
capital accounts are credited in their sacrificing ratio.
Adjustments for Revaluation of Assets and Reassessment of Liabilities: If, at the
time of admission of a partner, the assets and liabilities are revalued or some
asset or liability is found unrecorded, necessary adjustments are made through
the Revaluatiion Account. Any gain or loss arising from such exercise shall be
distributed among the old partner’s in their old profit sharing ratio.
Adjustment for reserves and accumulated profits/losses: If, at the time of admission
of a partner, any reserve and accumulated profits or losses exist in books of the
firm, these should be transferred to old partner’s capital/current accounts in
their old profit sharing ratio.
Determining/Adjusting partners’ capital: If agreed, the partner’s capital may be
adjusted so as to be proportionate to their new profit sharing ratio. In that
case, the new partner’s capital is normally used as a base for  determining the
new capitals of the old partners and necessary adjustment made through case
or by transfer to partner’s current accounts. Other basis also may be available
for determining capitals of the partners after admissioin of the new partner
like sharing the total capital to be in the firm immeidately after admission of
the new partner.
Change in profit sharing ratio: Sometimes the partners of a firm may agree to
change their existing profit sharing ratio. With a result, some partners will
gain in future profits while others will lose. In such a situation, the partner
who gain by change in profit effecting amounts to one partner buying the share
of profit from another partner. Apart from the payment for compensation, the
change in profit sharing ratio also necessitates adjustment in partner’s capital
accounts with respect to undistributed profits and reserves, revaluation of
assets and reassessment of liabilities.

Reconstitution of a Partnership Firm –
Retirement/Death of a Partner
ou have learnt that retirement or death of a
partner also leads to reconstitution of a
partnership firm. On the retirement or death of a
partner, the existing partnership deed comes to an
end, and in its place, a new partnership deed needs
to be framed whereby, the remaining partners
continue to do their business on changed terms and
conditions. There is not much difference in the
accounting treatment at the time of retirement or in
the event of death. In both the cases, we are required
to determine the sum due to the retiring partner (in
case of retirement) and to the legal representatives
(in case of deceased partner) after making necessary
adjustments in respect of goodwill, revaluation of a
assets and liabilities and transfer of accumulated
profits and losses. In addition, we may also have to
compute the new profit sharing’s ratio among the
remaining partners and so also their gaining ratio,
This covers all these aspects in detail.
4.1 Ascertaining the Amount Due to Retiring/
Deceased Partner
The sum due to the retiring partner (in case of
retirement) and to the legal representatives/
executors (in case of death) includes:
(i) credit balance of his capital account;
(ii) credit balance of his current account(if any);
(iii) his share of goodwill ;
(iv) his share of accumulated profits (reserves);
(v) his share in the gain of revaluation of assets
and liabilities;
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After Studying this chapter
you will be able to:
• calculate new profit
sharing ratio and  gaining
ratio of the remaining
partners
after
retirement/death of a
partner;
• describe the accounting
treatment of goodwill in
the event of retirement/
death of a partner;
• explain the accounting
treatment for revaluation of
assets and reassessment
of liabilities;
• make the necessary entries
in respect of unrecorded
assets and liabilities;
• make necessary adjust-
ment for accumulated
profits or losses;
• ascertain the retiring/
deceased partner claim
against the firm and
explain the mode of its
settlement;
• prepare the retiring
partner’s loan account, if
required; and.
• Prepare the deceased
partner’s
executor’s
account in the case of
death of a partner and the
balance sheet of a
reconstituted firm.
2015-16
Retirement/Death of a Partner
(vi) his share of profits up to the date of retirement/death;
(vii) interest on his capital, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death; and
(viii) salary/commission, if any, due to him up to the date of retirement/death.
The following deductions, if any, may have to be made from his share:
(i) debit balance of his current account(if any);
(ii) his share of goodwill to be written off; if necessary;
(iii) his share of accumulated losses;
(iv) his share of loss on revaluation of assets and liabilities;
(v) his share of loss up to the date of retirement/death;
(vi) his drawings up to the date of  retirement/death;
(vii) interest on drawings, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death.
Thus, as in the case of admission, the various accounting aspects involved on
retirement or death of a partner are as follows:
1. Ascertainment of new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio;
2. Treatment of goodwill;
3. Revaluation of assets and  liabilities;
4. Adjustment in respect of unrecorded assets and liabilities;
5. Distribution of accumulated profits and losses;
6. Ascertainment of share of profit or loss up to the date of retirement/death;
7. Adjustment of capital, if required;
8. Settlement of the amounts due to retired/deceased partner;
New Profit Sharing Ratio
New profit sharing ratio is the ratio in which the remaining partners will share
future profits after the retirement or death of any partner. The new share of each
of the remaining partner will consist of his own share in the firm plus the share
acquired from the retiring /deceased partner.
Consider the following situations :
(a) normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring or deceased
partners in the old profit sharing ratio, and there is no need to compute the
new profit sharing ratio among them, as it will be same as the old profit
sharing ratio among them. In fact, in the absence of any information regarding
profit sharing ratio in which the remaining partners acquire the share of
retiring/deceased partner, it is assumed that they will acquire it in the old
profit sharing ratio and so share the future profits in their old ratio. For
example, Asha, Deepti and Nisha are partners in a firm sharing profits and
losses in the ratio of 3:2:1. If Deepti retires, the new profit sharing ratio
between Asha and Nisha will be 3:1, unless they decide otherwise.
(b) The continuing partners may acquire the share in the profits of the
retiring/deceased partner in a proportion other than their old ratio, In that
case, there is need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them,
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
and it will be equal to sum total of their respective old share and the share
acquired from the retiring/deceased partner. For example: Naveen, Suresh
and Tarun are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3:2.
Suresh retires from the firm and his share was required by Naveen and
Tarun in the ratio 2:1. In such a case, the new share of profit will be
calculated as follows:
New share of Continuing Partner = Old Share + Acquired share from
the Outgoing Partner
Gaining Ratio 2 : 1
Share acquired by Naveen
Share acquired by Tarun
Share of Naveen
Share of Tarun
Thus, the new profit sharing ratio of Naveen and Tarun will be = 7 : 3.
(c) The contributing partners may agree on a specified new profit sharing
ratio: In that case the ratio so specified will be the new profit sharing ratio.
4.3 Gaining Ratio
The ratio in which the continuing partners have acquired the share from the
retiring/deceased partner is called the gaining ratio. Normally, the continuing
partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner in their old profit sharing
ratio, In that case, the gaining ratio of the remaining partners will be the same
as their old profit sharing ratio among them and there is no need to compute the
gaining ratio, Alternatively, proportion in which they acquire the share of the
retiring/deceased partner may be duly spacified. In that case, again, there is no
need to calculate the gaining ratio as it will be the ratio in which they have
acquired the share of profit from the retiring deceased partner. The problem of
calculating gaining ratio arises primarily when the new profit sharing ratio of
the continuing partners is specified. In such a situation, the gaining ratio should
be calculated by, deducting the old share of each continuing partners from his
new share. For example, Amit, Dinesh and Gagan are partners sharing profits
in the ratio of 5:3:2.
Dinesh retires. Amit and Gagan decide to share the profits of the new firm in
the ratio of  3:2. The gaining ratio will be calculated as follows :
2015-16
Retirement/Death of a Partner
Amit’s Gaining Share
Gagan’s Gaining Share
Thus, Gaining Ratio of Amit and Gagan = 1:2
This implies Amit gains 1
3  and Gagan gains 2
3  of Dinesh’s share of profit.
Gaining share of Continuing Partner = New share – Old share

4. When to calculate
Illustration 1
Madhu, Neha and Tina are partners sharing profits in the ratio of  5:3:2. Calculate
new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio if
1. Madhu retires
2. Neha retires
3. Tina retires.
Solution
Given old ratio among   Madhu :  Neha : Tina as 5 : 3 : 2
1. If  Madhu retires, new profit sharing Ratio between Neha and Tina will be
Neha : Tina = 3:2 and Gaining Ratio of Neha and Tina =3:2
2. If  Neha retires New profit sharing Ratio between Madhu and Tina will be
Madhu : Tina = 5:2
Gaining Ratio of Madhu and Tina = 5:2
3. If  Tina retires, new profit sharing ratio between Madhu and Neha will be:
Madhu : Neha = 5:3
Gaining ratio of Madhu and Neha = 5:3

3 : 2 : 1 : 4. Kumar retires and his share is acquired by Lakshya and Manoj in
the ratio of 3:2. Calculate new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio of the
remaining partners.
Solution
Lakshya

Notes : 1.
Since Lakshya and Manoj are acquiring Kumar’s share of profit in the ratio of
3:2, hence, the gaining ratio will be 3:2 between Lakshya and Manoj.
Naresh has neither sacrificed nor gained.

4.4  Treatment of Goodwill
The retiring or deceased partner is entitled to his share of goodwill at the time of
retirement/death because the goodwill has been earned by the firm with the
efforts of all the existing partners. Hence, at the time of retirement/death of a
partner, goodwill is valued as per agreement among the partners the retiring/
deceased partner compensated for his share of goodwill by the continuing
partners (who have gained due to acquisition of share of profit from the retiring/
deceased partner) in their gaining ratio.
The accounting treatment for goodwill in such a situation depends upon
whether or, not goodwill already appears in the books of the firm.
4.4.1 When Goodwill does not Appear in the Books
When goodwill does not appear in the books of the firm there are four ways in
which the retiring partner can be given the necessary credit for loss of his share
of goodwill, these are as follows:
2015-16
Retirement/Death of a Partner
(a) Goodwill is raised at its full value and retained in the books as such: In
this case, Goodwill Account is debited will its full value and all the partner’s
(including the retired/deceased partner) capital accounts are credited in the
old profit sharing ratio. The full value of goodwill will appear in the balance
sheet of the reconstituted firm.
(b)  Goodwill is raised at it’s full value and written off immediately: If it-
decided that goodwill should not be refrained and shown in the balance
sheet of the reconstituted firm then, after raising goodwill at its value by
crediting all the partners’ capital accounts (including that of the retired/
deceased partners, it should be written off by debiting the remaining partners
in their new profit sharing ratio and crediting the goodwill account with its
full value.
(c) Goodwill is raised to the extent of retired/deceased partner’s share and
written off immediately: In this case goodwill account is raised only to the
extent of retired/deceased partner’s share by debiting goodwill account with
the proportionate amount and credited only to the retired/deceased partner’s
capital account. Thereafter, the remaining partners capital accounts are
debited in their gaining ratio and goodwill account/credited to write it off.
(d) No goodwill account is raised at all in firm’s books: If it is decided that
the goodwill account should not appear in firm’s books at all, in that case it
is adjusted discretely through partners capital accounts by recording the
following journal entry.
Continuing partners’ capital A/c’s
(individually in their gaining ratio)
To Retiring/Deceased Partner’s Capital A/c
(Retiring/deceased in the remaining partners’
capital accounts into their gaining ratio)
Let us take an example and clarity the treatment of goodwill on retirement or
death of a partner using all the above alternatives. A, B. and C are partners in a
firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1 B retires. The goodwill of the firm is
valued at Rs. 60,000 and the remaining partners A and C continue to share
profits in the ratio of 3:1. The journal entries passed under various alternatives
shall be as follows:
(a) If goodwill is raised at full value and retained in books
Goodwill A/c
60,000
To A’s capital A/c
30,000
To B’s capital A/c
20,000
To C’s capital A/c
10,000
(Goodwill raised at full value and credited
to all the partners in their old  profit
sharing ratio)

To B’s capital A/c

C’s capital A/c

To Goodwill A/c
60,000
(Goodwill written off and debited to
remaining partners in the new ratio)
(c) If goodwill is raised to the extent of retiring partner’s share and written off immediately.
(i) Goodwill A/c
20,000
To B’s capital A/c
20,000
(Goodwill raised to the extant of B’s share)
(ii) A’s capital A/c
15,000
C’s capital A/c
5,000
To goodwill A/c
20,000
(Goodwill written off by debiting remaining
partners’ in gaining ratio)
If goodwill is not to after in firm’s books at all
A’s capital A/c
15,000
C’s capital A/c
5,000
To C’s capital A/c
20,000
(B’s share of goodwill adjusted to remaining
partners’ capital accounts in gaining ratio)
It may also happen that as a result of decision on the new profit sharing
ratio among the remaining partners, a continuing partner may also sacrifice a
part of his share in future profits. In such a situation his capital account will
also be credited along with the retiring/deceased partner’s capital account in
proportion to his sacrifice and the other continuing partners’ capital accounts
will be debited based on their gain in the future profit ratio.

4.4.2  When Goodwill is already Appearing in the Books
If value of goodwill already appearing in the books of the firm equals with the
current value of goodwill, normally no adjustment is required because goodwill
stands credited in the accounts of all the partners including the retiring one.
In case the present value of goodwill is different from its book value, an
adjustment entry is required for the difference between the value already
appearing in the books (called book value) and its present value. In such a
situation, there are two possibilities: (a) the book value of goodwill is lower than
its current value, and (b) the book value is greater than its current value. These
are discussed as follows.
(a) If the book value of goodwill is lower than its present value : In this
case the goodwill is raised to its present value by debiting goodwill
Account with the excess of its current value over the book value and
crediting all partners’ capital accounts in their old profit sharing ratio.
For example, Deepak, Nakul and Rajesh are partners sharing profits in
the ratio of 5:3:2. Goodwill appears in the books at a value of Rs. 20,000.
Nakul retires and, on the day of Nakul’s retirement, goodwill is valued at
Rs. 24,000. In this case, the following journal entry will be recorded.

value will be credited to Goodwill Account and debited to all Partners’
capital accounts in their old profit sharing ratio. For example, Mohanlal,
Girdharilal and Shyamlal are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 4:3:1.
Shyamlal retires from the firm. On Shyamlal’s retirement, goodwill has
been valued at Rs. 52,000. There was a goodwill account already
appearing in the books of the firm with a value of Rs. 60,000. In this
case, the following journal entry will be recorded.

(Decrease in the value of goodwill adjusted

It may be noted that in all the above situations, goodwill appears in the
balance sheet at its full value. In case it is decided by the partners that it should
be written-off, fully or partially, it can be done by debiting the remaining partner’s
capital accounts in the new profit sharing ratio and crediting Goodwill Account
with the respective value.
Alternatively, instead of first raising goodwill to its full value and then writing
it off, if the partners so decide, we may first write off the existing goodwill as it
appears in the book by debiting all partners in the old profit sharing ratio, and
then give the necessary credit to the retiring/deceased partner by debiting the
remaining partners capital accounts in their gaining ratio and crediting the
retired/deceased partner by his share of goodwill.  (See illustration 9)
4.4.3 Hidden Goodwill
If the firm has agreed to settle the retiring or deceased partner’s account by
paying him a lump sum amount, then the amount paid to him in excess of
what is due to him, based on the balance in his capital account after making
necessary adjustments in respect of accumulated profits and losses and
revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc., shall be treated as his share of goodwill
(known as hidden goodwill). For example, P, Q and R are partners in a firm
sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. R retires, and the balance in his capital account
after making necessary adjustments on account of reserves, revolution of assets
2015-16
Retirement/Death of a Partner
and liabilities works-out to be Rs. 60,000, P and Q agreed to pay him
Rs. 75,000 in full settlement of his claim. It implies that Rs. 15,000 is
R’s share of goodwill of the firm. This will be debits to the capital accounts of
P and Q in their gaining ratio (3:2 assuming no change in their own profit
sharing ratio) and crediting R’s capital Account as follows:
P’s Capital A/c
9,000
Q’s Capital A/c
6,000
To R’s Capital A/c
15,000
(R’s share of goodwill adjusted in P’s

4.5   Adjustment for Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities
At the time of retirement or death of a partner there may be some assets which
may not have been shown at their current values. Similarly, there may be certain
liabilities which have been shown at a value different from the obligation to be
met by the firm. Not only that, there may be some unrecorded assets and liabilities
which need to be brought into books. As learnt in case of admission of a partner,
a Revaluation Account is prepared in order to ascertain net gain (loss) on
revaluation of assets and/or liabilities and bringing unrecorded items into firm’s
books and the same is transferred to the capital account of all partners including
retiring/deceased partners in their old profit sharing ratio. the Journal entries

Adjustment of Accumulated Profits and Losses
Sometimes, the Balance Sheet of a firm may show accumulated profits in the
form of general reserve on reserve fund and/on accumulated losses in the form of
profit and loss account debit balance. The retiring/deceased partner is entitled
to his/her share in the accumulated profits and is also liable to share the
accumulated losses, if any. These accumulated profits or losses belong to all the
partners and should be transferred to the capital accounts of all partners in their
old profit sharing ratio. The following journal entries are recorded for the purpose.
(i) For transfer of accumulated profits (reserves),
Reserves A/c

as agreed or partly in cash immediately and partly in installment at the agreed
intervals. In the absence of any agreement, Section 37 of the Indian Partnership
Act, 1932 is applicable, which states that the outgoing partner has an option to
receive either interest @ 6% p.a. till the date of payment or such share of profits
which has been earned with his/her money (i.e., based on capital ratio). Hence,
the total amount due to the retiring partner which is ascertained after all
adjustments have been made is to be paid immediately to the retiring partner.
In case the firm is not in a position to make the payment immediately, the amount
due is transferred to the retiring Partner’s Loan Account, and as and when the
amount is paid it is debited to his account. The necessary journal entries recorded
are as follows.

Adjustment of Partners’ Capitals
At the time of retirement or death of a partner, the remaining partners may
decide to adjust their capital contributions in their profit sharing ratio. In such
a situation, the sum of balances in the capitals of continuing partners may be
treated as the total capital of the new firm, unless specified otherwise. Then, to
ascertain the new capital of the continuing partners, the total capital of the firm
is divided amongst the remaining partners as per the new profit sharing ratio,
and the excess or deficiency of capital in the individual capital account’s may be
worked out. Such excess or shortage shall be adjusted by withdrawal of
contribution in cash, as the case may be, for which the following journal entries
will be recorded.
(i) For excess capital withdrawn by the partner :
Partners’ Capital A/c
To Cash / Bank A/c
(ii) For amount of capital to be brought in by the partner:
Cash / Bank A/c
To Partners’ Capital A/c
Consider the following situations:
The adjustment of the continuing partner’s capitals may involve any one of the
three ways as illustrated as follows :
1. When the capital of the new firm as decided by the partners is specified.
Illustration 14
Mohit, Neeraj and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio
of 2 : 1 : 1. Neeraj retires and Mohit and Sohan decided that the capital of
the new firm will be fixed at Rs. 1,20,000. The capital accounts of Mohit
and Sohan show a credit balance of Rs. 82,000 and Rs. 41,000 respectively
after making all the adjustments. Calculate the actual cash to be paid off
or to be brought in by the continuing partners and pass the necessary
journal entries.

Asha, Deepa and Lata are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1.
Deepa retires. After making all adjustments relating to revaluation, goodwill and
accumulated profit etc., the capital accounts of Asha and Lata showed a credit
balance of Rs. 1,60,000 and Rs. 80,000 respectively. It was decided to adjust
the capitals of Asha and Lata in their new profit sharing ratio. You are required
to calculate the new capitals of the partners and record necessary journal entries
for bringing in or withdrawal of the necessary amounts involved.
Solution
a. Calculation of new capitals of the existinging partners
Balance in Asha’s Capital (after all adjustments)
=  1,60,000
Balance in Lata’s Capital
=     80,000
Total Capital of the New Firm
=  2,40,000
Based on the new profit sharing ratio of 2:1
Asha’s New Capital = Rs. 2,40,000
=  1,80,000
Lata’s New Capital = Rs. 2,40,000
=  60,000
Note :The total capital of the new firm is based on the sum of the balance in the capital
accounts of the continuing partners.

Illustration 16
Lalit, Pankaj and Rahul are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 4 : 3 : 3. After
all adjustments, on Lalit’s retirement with respect to general reserve, goodwill
and revaluation etc., the balances in their capital accounts stood at Rs. 70,000,
Rs. 60,000 and Rs. 50,000 respectively. It was decided that the amount payable
to Lalit will be brought by Pankaj and Rahul in such a way as to make their
capitals proportionate to their profit sharing ratio. Calculate the amount to be
brought by Pankaj and Rahul and record necessary journal entries for the same.
Also record necessary entry for payment to Lalit.
After Lalit’s retirement, the new profit sharing ratio between Pankaj and Rahul
is 3 : 3, i.e. 1 : 1.
Solution
a. Calculation of total capital of the new firm
Balance in Pankaj’s Capital account (after adjustment) =     60,000
Balance in Rahul’s Capital account (after adjustment)
=     50,000
Amount payable to Lalit (Retiring partner)
=     70,000
Total capital of new firm (i) + (ii) + (iii)
1,80,000
b. Calculation of new capitals of the continuing partners
Pankaj’s New Capital
=  Rs. 1,80,000
= Rs. 90,000
Rahul’s New Capital
=  Rs. 1,80,000

Death of a Partner
As stated earlier, the accounting treatment in the event of death of a partner is
similar to that in case of retirement of a partner, and that in case of death of a
partner his claim is transferred to his executors and settled in the same manner
as that of the retired partner. However, there is one major difference that, while
the retirement normally takes place at the end of an accounting period, the
death of a partner may occur any time. Hence, in case of a partner, his claim
shall also include his share of profit or loss, interest on capital, interest on
drawings (if any) from the date of the last Balance Sheet to the date of his death
2015-16
Retirement/Death of a Partner
of these, the main problem relates to the calculation of profit for the intervening
period (i.e., the period from date of the last balance sheet and the date of the
partner’s death. Since, it is considered cumbersome to close the books and
prepare final account, for the period, the deceased partner’s share of profit may
be calculated on the basis of last year’s profit (or average of past few years) or on
the basis of sales.
For example, Bakul, Champak and Darshan were partners in a firm sharing
profits in the ratio of 5:4:1. The profit of the firm for the year ending on March
31, 2016 was Rs.1,00,000. Champak dies on June 30, 2015. Champak’s share
of profit for the period from April 1 to June 30, 2015, shall be calculated as
follows:
Total profit for the year ending on 31st March, 2016 = Rs.1,00,000
Champak’s share of profit :
Proceeding Year’s Profit × Proportionate Period × Share of Deceased Partner
= Rs. 1,00,000
= Rs. 10,000
The journal entry will be recorded as follows :
Profit & Loss Suspense A/c
10,000
To Champak’s Capital A/c
10,000
(Champak’s share of profit transferred to his capital account)
Alternatively, if  Champak’s share of profit was to be calculated on the basis of
average profits of the last three years, which were Rs. 1,36,000 for 2012-13,
Rs. 1,54,000 for 2013-14 and Rs. 1,00,000 for 2015-16; Chambers share of
profits for the period from April 7, 2015 to June 30, 2015 shall be calculated on
the basis of average profit based on profits for the last year calculation as follows:
Total Profit
Average Profit = No. of years
= Rs. 1,36,000 + Rs. 1,54,000 + Rs. 1,00,000
Rs. 3,90,000  = Rs. 1,30,000
Champak’s share of profit
3 months
Rs. 1,30,000
months
= Rs. 13,000
In case, the agreement provides, that share of profit of the deceased partner
will be worked out on the basis of sales, and it is specified that the sales during
the year 2014-15 were Rs. 8,00,000 and the sales from April 1, 2015 to June
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
30, 2015 were Rs. 1,50,000 Champak’s share of profits for the period from
April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015 shall be calculated as follows.
If sale is Rs.8,00,000, the profit
= Rs.1,00,000
If sale is Rs.1, the profit

Retirement/Death of a Partner
Terms Introduced in the Chapter
• Retirement of a Partner.
Executors of deceased Partner
• Death of a Partner.
Executor’s Account.
• Gaining Ratio
Summary
New Profit Sharing Ratio: New profit sharing ratio is the ratio in which the
remaining partner will share future profits after the retirement or death of any
partner.
New Share = Old Share + Acquired Share from the Outgoing partner
Gaining Ratio: Gaining ratio is the ratio in which the continuing partners have
acquired the share from the retiring deceased partner.
Treatment of Goodwill: The basic rule is that gaining partner(s) shared
compensate the sacrificing partner to the extent of their gain for the respective
share of goodwill.
If goodwill already appears in the books, it will be written off by debiting all
partner’s capital account in their old profit sharing ratio.
Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities: At the time of retirement/death of a partner,
there may be some assets which may not have been shown at their current
values. Similarly, there may be certain liabilities which have been shown at a
value different from the obligation to be met by the firm.
Besides this, there may be unrecorded assets and liabilities which have to be
recorded.
Accumulated Profits or Losses: The reserves (Accumulated profits) or losses belong
to all the partners and should be transferred to capital account of all partners.
Retiring partner/deceased partner may be paid in one lump sum or
installments with interest.
At the time of retirement/death of a partner, the remaining partner may decide
to keep their capital contributions in their profit sharing ratio.

ou have learnt about the reconstitution of a
partnership firm which takes place on account
of admission, retirement or death of a partner. In such
a situation while the existing partnership is dissolved,
the firm may continue under the same name if the
partners so decide. In other words, it results in the
dissolution of a partnership but not that of the firm.
According to Section 39 of the partnership Act 1932,
the dissolution of partnership between all the partners
of a firm is called the dissolution of the firm. That
means the Act recognises the difference in the
breaking of relationship between all the partners of a
firm and between some of the partners; and it is the
breaking or discontinuance of relationship between
all the partners which is termed as the dissolution of
partnership firm. This brings an end to the existence
of firm, and no business is transacted after
dissolution except the activities related to closing of
the firm as the affairs of the firm are to be wound up
by selling firm’s assets and paying its liabilities and
discharging the claims of the partners.
5.1  Dissolution of Partnership
As stated earlier dissolution of partnership changes
the existing relationship between partners but the
firm may continue its business as before. The
dissolution of partnership may take place in any of
the following ways:
(1) Change in existing profit sharing ratio among
partners;
(2) Admission of a new partner;

(5) Insolvency of a partner;
(6) Completion of the venture, if partnership is formed for that; and
(7) Expiry of the period of partnership, if partnership is for a specific period
of time;
5.2  Dissolution of a firm
Dissolution of a partnership firm may take place without the intervention of
court or by the order of a court, in any of the ways specified later in this section.
It may be noted that dissolution of the firm necessarily brings in dissolution of
the partnership.
Dissolution of a firm takes place in any of the following ways:
1. Dissolution by Agreement: A firm is dissolved :
(a) with the consent of all the partners or
(b) in accordance with a contract between the partners.
2. Compulsory Dissolution: A firm is dissolved compulsorily in the following cases:
(a) when all the partners or all but one partner, become insolvent, rendering
them incompetent to sign a contract;
(b) when the business of the firm becomes illegal; or
(c) when some event has taken place which makes it unlawful for the partners
to carry on the business of the firm in partnership, e.g., when a partner
who is a citizen of a country becomes an alien enemy because of the
declaration of war with his country and India.
3. On the happening of certain contingencies: Subject to contract between the
partners, a firm is dissolved :
(a) if constituted for a fixed term, by the expiry of that term;
(b) if constituted to carry out one or more ventures, by the completion thereof;
(c) by the death of a partner;
(d) by the adjudication of a partner as an insolvent.
4. Dissolution by Notice: In case of partnership at will, the firm may be dissolved
if any one of the partners gives a notice in writing to the other partners,
signifying his intention of seeking dissolution of the firm.
5. Dissolution by Court: At the suit of a partner, the court may order a
partnership firm to be dissolved on any of the following grounds:
(a) when a partner becomes insane;
(b) when a partner becomes permanently incapable of performing his duties
as a partner;
(c) when a partner is guilty of misconduct which is likely to adversely affect
the business of the firm;
2015-16

(d) when a partner persistently commits breach of partnership agreement;
(e) when a partner has transferred the whole of his interest in the firm to a

Dissolution of Partnership Firm
5.3 Settlement of Accounts
In case of dissolution of a firm, the firm ceases to conduct business and has to
settle its accounts. For this purpose, it disposes off all its assets for satisfying all
the claims against it. In this context it should be noted that, subject to agreement
among the partners, the following rules as provided in Section 48 of the
Partnership Act 1932 shall apply.
(a) Treatment of Losses
Losses, including deficiencies of capital, shall be paid :
(i) first out of profits,
(ii) next out of capital of partners, and
(iii) lastly, if necessary, by the partners individually in their profits sharing ratio.
(b) Application of Assets
The assets of the firm, including any sum contributed by the partners to make
up deficiencies of capital, shall be applied in the following manner and order:
(i) In paying the debts of the firm to the third parties;
(ii) In paying each partner proportionately what is due to him/her from the
firm for advances as distinguished from capital (i.e. partner’ loan);
(iii) In paying to each partner proportionately what is due to him on account
of capital; and
(iv) the residue, if any, shall be divided among the partners in their profit
sharing ratio.
Thus, the amount realised from assets along with contribution from partners, if
required, shall be utilised first to pay off the outside liabilities of the firm such as
creditors, loans, bank overdraft, bill payables, etc. (it may be noted that secured
loans have precedence over the unsecured loans); the balance should be applied
to repay loans and advances made by the partners to the firm. (in case the
balance amount is not adequate enough to pay off such loans and advances,
they are to be paid propartionately); and surplus, if any is to be utilised in
settlement of the capital account balances, after adjusting all profits and losses.
Private Debts and Firm’s Debts: Where both the debts of the firm and private debts of
a partner co-exist, the following rules, as stated in Section 49 of the Act, shall apply.
(a) The property of the firm shall be applied first in the payment of debts of the
firm and then the surplus, if any, shall be divided among the partners as
per their claims, which can be utilised for payment of their private liabilities.
(b) The private property of any partner shall be applied first in payment of
his private debts and the surplus, if any, may be utilised for payment of
the firm’s debts, in case the firm’s liabilities exceed the firm’s assets.
It may be noted that the private property of the partner does not include the
personal properties of his wife and children. Thus, if the assets of the firm are
not adequate enough to pay off firm’s liabilities, the partners have to contribute
out of their net private assets (private assets minus private liabilities).
2015-16
Accountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts
Inability of a Partner to Contribute Towards Deficiency
In the context of settlement of accounts among the partners there is still another
important aspect to be noted, i.e., when a partner is unable to contribute towards
the deficiency of his capital account (the account finally showing a debit balance),
he/she is said to be insolvent, and the sum not recoverable is treated as capital loss
for the firm. In the absence of any agreement, to the contrary, such a capital loss is
to be borne by the remaining solvent partners in accordance with the principle laid
down in Garner vs. Murray case, which states that the solvent partners have to bear
such loss in the ratio of their capitals as on the date of dissolution. However, the
accounting treatment relating to dissolution of partnership on account of insolvency
of partners is not being taken up at this stage.
5.4 Accounting Treatment
When the firm is dissolved, its books of account are to be closed and the profit or
loss arising on realisation of its assets and discharge of liabilities is to be
computed. For this purpose, a Realisation Account is prepared to ascertain the
net effect (profit or loss) of realisation of assets and payment of liabilities which
may be is transferred to partner’s capital accounts in their profit sharing ratio.
Hence, all assets (other than cash in hand bank balance and fictitious assets, if
any), and all external liabilities are transferred to this account. It also records
the sale of assets, and payment of liabilities and realisation expenses. The balance
in this account is termed as profit or loss on realisation which is transferred to
partners’ capital accounts in thier profit sharing ratio (see figure 5.1)

Summary
Dissolution of Partnership Firm : The dissolution of a firm implies the
discontinuance of partnership business and separation of economic relations
between the partners. In the case of a dissolution of a firm, the firm closes its
business altogether and realises all its assets and pays all its liabilities. The
payment is made to the creditors first out of the assets realised and, if necessary,
next out of the contributions made by the partners in their profit sharing ratio.
When all accounts are settled and the final payment is made to the partners
for the amounts due to them, the books of the firm are closed.
Dissolution of Partnership : A partnership gets terminated in case of admission,
retirement death, etc. of a partner. This does not necessarily involve dissolution
of the firm.
Realisation Account : The Realisation Account is prepared to record the
transactions relating to sale and realisation of assets and settlement of creditors.
Any profit or loss arising act of this process is shared by partners’ in their
profit sharing ratio. Partners’ accounts are also settled and the Cash or Bank
account is closed.
