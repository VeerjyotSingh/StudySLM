Question 10.2:
Why is sulphuric acid not used during the reaction of alcohols with KI?
In the presence of sulphuric acid (H2SO4), KI produces HI
Since
is an oxidizing agent, it oxidizes HI (produced in the reaction to I2).
As a result, the reaction between alcohol and HI to produce alkyl iodide cannot occur.
Therefore, sulphuric acid is not used during the reaction of alcohols with KI. Instead, a non-
oxidizing acid such as H3PO4 is used.

Arrange each set of compounds in order of increasing boiling points.
(i) Bromomethane, Bromoform, Chloromethane, Dibromomethane.
(ii) 1-Chloropropane, Isopropyl chloride, 1-Chlorobutane.
Answer
For alkyl halides containing the same alkyl group, the boiling point increases with an increase
in the atomic mass of the halogen atom.
Since the atomic mass of Br is greater than that of Cl, the boiling point of bromomethane is
higher than that of chloromethane.
Further, for alkyl halides containing the same alkyl group, the boiling point increases with an
increase in the number of halides. Therefore, the boiling point of Dibromomethane is higher
than that of chloromethane and bromomethane, but lower than that of bromoform.
Hence, the given set of compounds can be arranged in the order of their increasing boiling
points as:
Chloromethane < Bromomethane < Dibromomethane < Bromoform.
For alkyl halides containing the same halide, the boiling point increases with an increase in the
size of the alkyl group. Thus, the boiling point of 1-chlorobutane is higher than that of
isopropyl chloride and 1-chloropropane.
Further, the boiling point decreases with an increase in branching in the chain. Thus, the
boiling point of isopropyl alcohol is lower than that of 1-chloropropane.
Hence, the given set of compounds can be arranged in the increasing order of their boiling
points as:
Isopropyl chloride < 1-Chloropropane < 1-Chlorobutane

HALOALKANES AND ARENES: NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL K V HIRANAGAR
Which alkyl halide from the following pairs would you expect to react more rapidly by an SN2
mechanism? Explain your answer.
(iii)
Answer
2-bromobutane is a 2° alkylhalide whereas 1-bromobutane is a 1° alkyl halide. The
approaching of nucleophile is more hindered in 2-bromobutane than in 1-bromobutane.
Therefore, 1-bromobutane reacts more rapidly than 2-bromobutane by an SN2 mechanism.
2-Bromobutane is 2° alkylhalide whereas 2-bromo-2-methylpropane is 3° alkyl halide.
Therefore, greater numbers of substituents are present in 3° alkyl halide than in 2° alkyl
halide to hinder the approaching nucleophile. Hence, 2-bromobutane reacts more rapidly than
2-bromo-2-methylpropane by an SN2 mechanism.
(iii)
HALOALKANES AND ARENES: NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL K V HIRANAGAR
Both the alkyl halides are primary. However, the substituent −CH3 is at a greater distance to
the carbon atom linked to Br in 1-bromo-3-methylbutane than in 1-bromo-2-methylbutane.
Therefore, the approaching nucleophile is less hindered in case of the former than in case of
the latter. Hence, the former reacts faster than the latter by SN2 mechanism
Question 10.8:
In the following pairs of halogen compounds, which compound undergoes faster SN1 reaction?
Answer
SN1 reaction proceeds via the formation of carbocation. The alkyl halide (I) is 3° while (II) is
2°. Therefore, (I) forms 3° carbocation while (II) forms 2° carbocation. Greater the stability of
the carbocation, faster is the rate of SN1 reaction. Since 3° carbocation is more stable than 2°
carbocation. (I), i.e. 2−chloro-2-methylpropane, undergoes faster SN1 reaction than (II) i.e.,
3-chloropentane.
The alkyl halide (I) is 2° while (II) is 1°. 2° carbocation is more stable than 1° carbocation.
Therefore, (I), 2−chloroheptane, undergoes faster SN1 reaction than (II), 1-chlorohexane

Which one of the following has the highest dipole moment?
(i) CH2Cl2
(ii) CHCl3
(iii) CCl4
Answer
Dichlormethane (CH2Cl2)
μ = 1.60D
Chloroform (CHCl3)
μ = 1.08D
(iii)
Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)
μ = 0D
CCl4 is a symmetrical molecule. Therefore, the dipole moments of all four C−Cl bonds cancel
each other. Hence, its resultant dipole moment is zero.
As shown in the above figure, in CHCl3, the resultant of dipole moments of two C−Cl bonds is
opposed by the resultant of dipole moments of one C−H bond and one C−Cl bond. Since the
resultant of one C−H bond and one C−Cl bond dipole moments is smaller than two C−Cl
HALOALKANES AND ARENES: NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL K V HIRANAGAR
bonds, the opposition is to a small extent. As a result, CHCl3 has a small dipole moment of
1.08 D.
On the other hand, in case of CH2Cl2, the resultant of the dipole moments of two C−Cl bonds
is strengthened by the resultant of the dipole moments of two C−H bonds. As a result, CH2Cl2
has a higher dipole moment of 1.60 D than CHCl3 i.e., CH2Cl2 has the highest dipole moment.
Hence, the given compounds can be arranged in the increasing order of their dipole moments
CCl4 < CHCl3 < CH2Cl2
Question 10.5:
A hydrocarbon C5H10 does not react with chlorine in dark but gives a single monochloro
compound C5H9Cl in bright sunlight. Identify the hydrocarbon.
Answer
A hydrocarbon with the molecular formula, C5H10 belongs to the group with a general
molecular formula CnH2n. Therefore, it may either be an alkene or a cycloalkane.
Since hydrocarbon does not react with chlorine in the dark, it cannot be an alkene. Thus, it
should be a cycloalkane.
Further, the hydrocarbon gives a single monochloro compound, C5H9Cl by reacting with
chlorine in bright sunlight. Since a single monochloro compound is formed, the hydrocarbon
must contain H−atoms that are all equivalent. Also, as all H−atoms of a cycloalkane are
equivalent, the hydrocarbon must be a cycloalkane. Hence, the said compound is
cyclopentane.

Question 10.8:
What are ambident nucleophiles? Explain with an example.
Answer
Ambident nucleophiles are nucleophiles having two nucleophilic sites. Thus, ambident
nucleophiles have two sites through which they can attack.
For example, nitrite ion is an ambident nucleophile.
Nitrite ion can attack through oxygen resulting in the formation of alkyl nitrites. Also, it can
attack through nitrogen resulting in the formation of nitroalkanes.
Question 10.9:
Which compound in each of the following pairs will react faster in SN2 reaction with OH−?
HALOALKANES AND ARENES: NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL K V HIRANAGAR
(i) CH3Br or CH3I
(ii) (CH3)3CCl or CH3Cl
Answer
(i) In the SN2 mechanism, the reactivity of halides for the same alkyl group increases in the
order. This happens because as the size increases, the halide ion becomes a better leaving
group.
R−F << R−Cl < R−Br < R−I
Therefore, CH3I will react faster than CH3Br in SN2 reactions with OH−.
The SN2 mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile at the atom bearing the leaving
group. But, in case of (CH3)3CCl, the attack of the nucleophile at the carbon atom is hindered
because of the presence of bulky substituents on that carbon atom bearing the leaving group.
On the other hand, there are no bulky substituents on the carbon atom bearing the leaving
group in CH3Cl. Hence, CH3Cl reacts faster than (CH3)3CCl in SN2 reaction with OH−.

Answer
HALOALKANES AND ARENES: NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL K V HIRANAGAR
1−bromo−1−methylcyclohexane
In the given compound, all β-hydrogen atoms are equivalent. Thus, dehydrohalogenation of
this compound gives only one alkene.
In the given compound, there are two different sets of equivalent β-hydrogen atoms labelled
as a and b. Thus, dehydrohalogenation of the compound yields two alkenes.
Saytzeff’s rule implies that in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the alkene having a greater
number of alkyl groups attached to a doubly bonded carbon atoms is preferably produced.
Therefore, alkene (I) i.e., 2-methylbut-2-ene is the major product in this reaction.
(iii)
2,2,3-Trimethyl-3-bromopentane
In the given compound, there are two different sets of equivalent β-hydrogen atoms labelled

Question 10.12:
Explain why
(i) the dipole moment of chlorobenzene is lower than that of cyclohexyl chloride?
(ii) alkyl halides, though polar, are immiscible with water?
(iii) Grignard reagents should be prepared under anhydrous conditions?
Answer
In chlorobenzene, the Cl-atom is linked to a sp2 hybridized carbon atom. In cyclohexyl
chloride, the Cl-atom is linked to a sp3 hybridized carbon atom. Now, sp2 hybridized carbon
has more s-character than sp3 hybridized carbon atom. Therefore, the former is more
electronegative than the latter. Therefore, the density of electrons of C−Cl bond near the Cl-
atom is less in chlorobenzene than in cydohexyl chloride.
Moreover, the −R effect of the benzene ring of chlorobenzene decreases the electron density
of the C−Cl bond near the Cl-atom. As a result, the polarity of the C−Cl bond in chlorobenzene
decreases. Hence, the dipole moment of chlorobenzene is lower than that of cyclohexyl
chloride.
(ii) To be miscible with water, the solute-water force of attraction must be stronger than the
solute-solute and water-water forces of attraction. Alkyl halides are polar molecules and so
held together by dipole-dipole interactions. Similarly, strong H-bonds exist between the water
molecules. The new force of attraction between the alkyl halides and water molecules is
weaker than the alkyl halide-alkyl halide and water-water forces of attraction. Hence, alkyl
halides (though polar) are immiscible with water.
(iii) Grignard reagents are very reactive. In the presence of moisture, they react to give
alkanes.

Uses of Freon − 12
Freon-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane, CF2Cl2) is commonly known as CFC. It is used as a
refrigerant in refrigerators and air conditioners. It is also used in aerosol spray propellants
such as body sprays, hair sprays, etc. However, it damages the ozone layer. Hence, its
manufacture was banned in the United States and many other countries in 1994.
Uses of DDT
DDT (p, p−dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is one of the best known insecticides. It is very
effective against mosquitoes and lice. But due its harmful effects, it was banned in the United
States in 1973.
Uses of carbontetrachloride (CCl4)
(i) It is used for manufacturing refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans.
(ii) It is used as feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals.
(iii) It is used as a solvent in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
(iv) Until the mid 1960’s, carbon tetrachloride was widely used as a cleaning fluid, a
degreasing agent in industries, a spot reamer in homes, and a fire extinguisher.
Uses of iodoform (CHI3)
Iodoform was used earlier as an antiseptic, but now it has been replaced by other
formulations-containing iodine-due to its objectionable smell. The antiseptic property of
iodoform is only due to the liberation of free iodine when it comes in contact with the skin

An SN2 reaction involves the approaching of the nucleophile to the carbon atom to which the
leaving group is attached. When the nucleophile is sterically hindered, then the reactivity
towards SN2 displacement decreases. Due to the presence of substituents, hindrance to the
approaching nucleophile increases in the following order.
1-Bromopentane < 2-bromopentane < 2-Bromo-2-methylbutane
Hence, the increasing order of reactivity towards SN
2 displacement is:
2-Bromo-2-methylbutane < 2-Bromopentane < 1-Bromopentane
Since steric hindrance in alkyl halides increases in the order of 1° < 2° < 3°, the increasing
order of reactivity towards SN2 displacement is
3° < 2° < 1°.
Hence, the given set of compounds can be arranged in the increasing order of their reactivity
towards SN
2 displacement as:
2-Bromo-2-methylbutane < 2-Bromo-3-methylbutane < 1-Bromo-3-methylbutane

Question 10.20:
The treatment of alkyl chlorides with aqueous KOH leads to the formation of
alcohols but in the presence of alcoholic KOH, alkenes are major products. Explain.
Answer
In an aqueous solution, KOH almost completely ionizes to give OH− ions. OH− ion is a strong
nucleophile, which leads the alkyl chloride to undergo a substitution reaction to form alcohol.
On the other hand, an alcoholic solution of KOH contains alkoxide (RO−) ion, which is a strong
base. Thus, it can abstract a hydrogen from the β-carbon of the alkyl chloride and form an
alkene by eliminating a molecule of HCl.
HALOALKANES AND ARENES: NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL K V HIRANAGAR
OH− ion is a much weaker base than RO− ion. Also, OH− ion is highly solvated in an aqueous
solution and as a result, the basic character of OH− ion decreases. Therefore, it cannot
abstract a hydrogen from the β-carbon.

(b) is reacted with HBr to give (c) which is an isomer of (a). When (a) is reacted with sodium
metal it gives compound (d), C8H18 which is different from the compound formed when n-butyl
bromide is reacted with sodium. Give the structural formula of (a) and write the equations for
all the reactions.
Answer
There are two primary alkyl halides having the formula, C4H9Br. They are n − bulyl bromide
and isobutyl bromide.
Therefore, compound (a) is either n−butyl bromide or isobutyl bromide.
Now, compound (a) reacts with Na metal to give compound (b) of molecular formula, C8H18,
which is different from the compound formed when n−butyl bromide reacts with Na metal.
Hence, compound (a) must be isobutyl bromide.
Thus, compound (d) is 2, 5−dimethylhexane.
It is given that compound (a) reacts with alcoholic KOH to give compound (b). Hence,
compound (b) is 2−methylpropene.

Question 11.14:
Give two reactions that show the acidic nature of phenol. Compare acidity of phenol with that

Answer
The acidic nature of phenol can be represented by the following two reactions:
(i) Phenol reacts with sodium to give sodium phenoxide, liberating H2.
(ii) Phenol reacts with sodium hydroxide to give sodium phenoxide and water as by-products.
The acidity of phenol is more than that of ethanol. This is because after losing a proton, the
phenoxide ion undergoes resonance and gets stabilized whereas ethoxide ion does not.
Question 11.15:
Explain why is ortho nitrophenol more acidic than ortho methoxyphenol?
ALCOHOL, PHENOLS AND ETHERS NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY:   MANISH TULI , PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Answer
The nitro-group is an electron-withdrawing group. The presence of this group in the ortho
position decreases the electron density in the O−H bond. As a result, it is easier to lose a
proton. Also, the o-nitrophenoxide ion formed after the loss of protons is stabilized by
resonance. Hence, ortho nitrophenol is a stronger acid.
On the other hand, methoxy group is an electron-releasing group. Thus, it increases the
electron density in the O−H bond and hence, the proton cannot be given out easily.
For this reason, ortho-nitrophenol is more acidic than ortho-methoxyphenol
Question 11.16:
Explain how does the −OH group attached to a carbon of benzene ring activate it towards
electrophilic substitution?
Answer
The −OH group is an electron-donating group. Thus, it increases the electron density in the

As a result, the benzene ring is activated towards electrophilic substitution

Question 11.22:
Give reason for the higher boiling point of ethanol in comparison to methoxymethane.
Answer
Ethanol undergoes intermolecular H-bonding due to the presence of −OH group, resulting in

Question 11.27:
Preparation of ethers by acid dehydration of secondary or tertiary alcohols is not a suitable

Answer
The formation of ethers by dehydration of alcohol is a bimolecular reaction (SN2) involving the
attack of an alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol molecule. In the method, the alkyl group
should be unhindered. In case of secondary or tertiary alcohols, the alkyl group is hindered. As

CH3CHO, CH3CH2OH, CH3OCH3, CH3CH2CH3
Answer
The molecular masses of the given compounds are in the range 44 to 46. CH3CH2OH
undergoes extensive intermolecular H-bonding, resulting in the association of molecules.
Therefore, it has the highest boiling point. CH3CHO is more polar than CH3OCH3 and so
CH3CHO has stronger intermolecular dipole − dipole attraction than CH3OCH3⋅ CH3CH2CH3 has
only weak van der Waals force. Thus, the arrangement of the given compounds in the
increasing order of their boiling points is given by:
CH3CH2CH3 < CH3OCH3 < CH3CHO < CH3CH2OH
Question 12.4:
Arrange the following compounds in increasing order of their reactivity in nucleophilic addition

Hint:Consider steric effect and electronic effect.
Answer
The +I effect of the alkyl group increases in the order:
Ethanal < Propanal < Propanone < Butanone
The electron density at the carbonyl carbon increases with the increase in the +I effect. As a
result, the chances of attack by a nucleophile decrease. Hence, the increasing order of the
reactivities of the given carbonyl compounds in nucleophilic addition reactions is:
Butanone < Propanone < Propanal < Ethanal

The +I effect of −CH3 group increases the electron density on the O−H bond. Therefore,
release of proton becomes difficult. On the other hand, the −I effect of F decreases the
electron density on the O−H bond. Therefore, proton can be released easily. Hence, CH2FCO2H
is a stronger acid than CH3CO2H.
F has stronger −I effect than Cl. Therefore, CH2FCO2H can release proton more easily than
CH2ClCO2H. Hence, CH2FCO2H is stronger acid than CH2ClCO2H.
(iii)
Inductive effect decreases with increase in distance. Hence, the +I effect of F in
CH3CHFCH2CO2H is more than it is in CH2FCH2CH2CO2H. Hence, CH3CHFCH2CO2H is stronger
acid than CH2FCH2CH2CO2H.
Due to the −I effect of F, it is easier to release proton in the case of compound (A). However,
in the case of compound (B), release of proton is difficult due to the +I effect of −CH3 group.
Hence, (A) is a stronger acid than (B).

PREAPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
It is given that the compound (with molecular formula C9H10O) forms 2, 4-DNP derivative and
reduces Tollen’s reagent. Therefore, the given compound must be an aldehyde.
Again, the compound undergoes cannizzaro reaction and on oxidation gives 1, 2-
benzenedicarboxylic acid. Therefore, the −CHO group is directly attached to a benzene ring
and this benzaldehyde is ortho-substituted. Hence, the compound is 2-ethylbenzaldehyde.
The given reactions can be explained by the following equations.

Answer
An organic compound A with molecular formula C8H16O2 gives a carboxylic acid (B) and an
alcohol (C) on hydrolysis with dilute sulphuric acid. Thus, compound A must be an ester.
Further, alcohol C gives acid B on oxidation with chromic acid. Thus, B and C must contain
equal number of carbon atoms.
Since compound A contains a total of 8 carbon atoms, each of B and C contain 4 carbon
atoms.

(i) When HCN reacts with a compound, the attacking species is a nucleophile, CN−. Therefore,
as the negative charge on the compound increases, its reactivity with HCN decreases. In the
given compounds, the +I effect increases as shown below. It can be observed that steric
hindrance also increases in the same
Hence, the given compounds can be arranged according to their increasing reactivities toward
HCN as:
Di-tert-butyl ketone < Methyl tert-butyl ketone < Acetone < Acetaldehyde
(ii) After losing a proton, carboxylic acids gain a negative charge as shown:
Now, any group that will help stabilise the negative charge will increase the stability of the
carboxyl ion and as a result, will increase the strength of the acid. Thus, groups having +I
effect will decrease the strength of the acids and groups having −I effect will increase the
strength of the acids. In the given compounds, −CH3 group has +I effect and Br− group has
−I effect. Thus, acids containing Br− are stronger.
Now, the +I effect of isopropyl group is more than that of n-propyl group. Hence,
(CH3)2CHCOOH is a weaker acid than CH3CH2CH2COOH.
Also, the −I effect grows weaker as distance increases. Hence, CH3CH(Br)CH2COOH is a
weaker acid than CH3CH2CH(Br)COOH.
Hence, the strengths of the given acids increase as:
(CH3)2CHCOOH < CH3CH2CH2COOH < CH3CH(Br)CH2COOH < CH3CH2CH(Br)COOH
(iii) As we have seen in the previous case, electron-donating groups decrease the strengths of
acids, while electron-withdrawing groups increase the strengths of acids. As methoxy group is
an electron-donating group, 4-methoxybenzoic acid is a weaker acid than benzoic acid. Nitro
group is an electron-withdrawing group and will increase the strengths of acids. As 3,4-

Describe the following:
(i) Acetylation
(ii) Cannizzaro reaction
(iii) Cross aldol condensation
(iv) Decarboxylation
Answer
(i) Acetylation
The introduction of an acetyl functional group into an organic compound is known as
acetylation. It is usually carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine,
dirnethylaniline, etc. This process involves the substitution of an acetyl group for an active
hydrogen atom. Acetyl chloride and acetic anhydride are commonly used as acetylating
agents.
For example, acetylation of ethanol produces ethyl acetate.
(ii) Cannizzaro reaction:
The self oxidation-reduction (disproportionation) reaction of aldehydes having no α-hydrogens
on treatment with concentrated alkalis is known as the Cannizzaro reaction. In this reaction,
two molecules of aldehydes participate where one is reduced to alcohol and the other is
oxidized to carboxylic acid.
For example, when ethanol is treated with concentrated potassium hydroxide, ethanol and
potassium ethanoate are produced.

formation of semicarbazones.
(iii) During the preparation of esters from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in the presence of
an acid catalyst, the water or the ester should be removed as soon as it is formed.
Answer
(i) Cyclohexanones form cyanohydrins according to the following equation.
ALDEHYDE , KETONES AND CARBOXYLIC ACID : NCERT SOLUTION
PREAPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
In this case, the nucleophile CN− can easily attack without any steric hindrance. However, in
the case of 2, 2, 6 trimethylcydohexanone, methyl groups at α-positions offer steric
hindrances and as a result, CN− cannot attack effectively.
For this reason, it does not form a cyanohydrin.
(ii) Semicarbazide undergoes resonance involving only one of the two −NH2 groups, which is
attached directly to the carbonyl-carbon atom.
Therefore, the electron density on −NH2 group involved in the resonance also decreases. As a
result, it cannot act as a nucleophile. Since the other −NH2 group is not involved in resonance;
it can act as a nucleophile and can attack carbonyl-carbon atoms of aldehydes and ketones to
produce semicarbazones.
(iii) Ester along with water is formed reversibly from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in
presence of an acid.
If either water or ester is not removed as soon as it is formed, then it reacts to give back the
reactants as the reaction is reversible. Therefore, to shift the equilibrium in the forward
direction i.e., to produce more ester, either of the two should be removed.
Question 12.19:

Answer
% of carbon = 69.77 %
% of hydrogen = 11.63 %

= 18.6 %
Thus, the ratio of the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the organic

Therefore, the empirical formula of the compound is C5H10O. Now, the empirical formula mass
of the compound can be given as:
5 × 12 + 10 ×1 + 1 × 16
Molecular mass of the compound = 86
Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is given by C5H10O.
Since the given compound does not reduce Tollen’s reagent, it is not an aldehyde. Again, the
compound forms sodium hydrogen sulphate addition products and gives a positive iodoform
test. Since the compound is not an aldehyde, it must be a methyl ketone.
The given compound also gives a mixture of ethanoic acid and propanoic acid.
Hence, the given compound is pentan−2−ol.

Question 12.20:
Although phenoxide ion has more number of resonating structures than carboxylate ion,
carboxylic acid is a stronger acid than phenol. Why?
Answer
Resonance structures of phenoxide ion are:
It can be observed from the resonance structures of phenoxide ion that in II, III and IV, less
electronegative carbon atoms carry a negative charge. Therefore, these three structures
contribute negligibly towards the resonance stability of the phenoxide ion. Hence, these
structures can be eliminated. Only structures I and V carry a negative charge on the more
electronegative oxygen atom.
Resonance structures of carboxylate ion are:
In the case of carboxylate ion, resonating structures I′ and II′ contain a charge carried by a
more electronegative oxygen atom.
Further, in resonating structures I′ and II′, the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen
atoms. But in resonating structures I and V of the phexoxide ion, the negative charge is
ALDEHYDE , KETONES AND CARBOXYLIC ACID : NCERT SOLUTION
PREAPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
localized on the same oxygen atom. Therefore, the resonating structures of carboxylate ion
contribute more towards its stability than those of phenoxide ion. As a result, carboxylate ion
is more resonance-stabilized than phenoxide ion. Hence, carboxylic acid is a stronger acid than
phenol.

(iii) CH3NH2, (CH3)2NH, (CH3)3N, C6H5NH2, C6H5CH2NH2.
Answer
(i) Considering the inductive effect of alkyl groups, NH3, C2H5NH2, and (C2H5)2NH can be
arranged in the increasing order of their basic strengths as:
Again, C6H5NH2 has proton acceptability less than NH3. Thus, we have:
Due to the −I effect of C6H5 group, the electron density on the N-atom in C6H5CH2NH2 is lower
than that on the N-atom in C2H5NH2, but more than that in NH3. Therefore, the given
compounds can be arranged in the order of their basic strengths as:
(ii) Considering the inductive effect and the steric hindrance of the alkyl groups, C2H5NH2, (C2
H5)2NH2, and their basic strengths as follows:
Again, due to the −R effect of C6H5 group, the electron density on the N atom in C6H5 NH2 is
lower than that on the N atom in C2H5NH2. Therefore, the basicity of C6H5NH2 is lower than
that of C2H5NH2. Hence, the given compounds can be arranged in the increasing order of their
basic strengths as follows:
(iii) Considering the inductive effect and the steric hindrance of alkyl groups, CH3NH2,
(CH3)2NH, and (CH3)3N can be arranged in the increasing order of their basic strengths as:
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
In C6H5NH2, N is directly attached to the benzene ring. Thus, the lone pair of electrons on the
N−atom is delocalized over the benzene ring. In C6H5CH2NH2, N is not directly attached to the
benzene ring. Thus, its lone pair is not delocalized over the benzene ring. Therefore, the
electrons on the N atom are more easily available for protonation in C6H5CH2NH2 than in
C6H5NH2 i.e., C6H5CH2NH2 is more basic than C6H5NH2.
Again, due to the −I effect of C6H5 group, the electron density on the N−atom in C6H5CH2NH2
is lower than that on the N−atom in (CH3)3N. Therefore, (CH3)3N is more basic than
C6H5CH2NH2. Thus, the given compounds can be arranged in the increasing order of their basic
strengths as follows.

(i) Methylamine and dimethylamine
(ii) Secondary and tertiary amines
(iii) Ethylamine and aniline
(iv) Aniline and benzylamine
(v) Aniline and N-methylaniline.
Answer
(i) Methylamine and dimethylamine can be distinguished by the carbylamine test.
Carbylamine test: Aliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform and
ethanolic potassium hydroxide form foul-smelling isocyanides or carbylamines. Methylamine
(being an aliphatic primary amine) gives a positive carbylamine test, but dimethylamine does
(ii) Secondary and tertiary amines can be distinguished by allowing them to react with
Hinsberg’s reagent (benzenesulphonyl chloride, C6H5SO2Cl).
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Secondary amines react with Hinsberg’s reagent to form a product that is insoluble in an
alkali. For example, N, N−diethylamine reacts with Hinsberg’s reagent to form N,
N−diethylbenzenesulphonamide, which is insoluble in an alkali. Tertiary amines, however, do
not react with Hinsberg’s reagent.
(iii) Ethylamine and aniline can be distinguished using the azo-dye test. A dye is obtained
when aromatic amines react with HNO2 (NaNO2 + dil.HCl) at 0-5°C, followed by a reaction
with the alkaline solution of 2-naphthol. The dye is usually yellow, red, or orange in colour.
Aliphatic amines give a brisk effervescence due (to the evolution of N2 gas) under similar
conditions.
(iv) Aniline and benzylamine can be distinguished by their reactions with the help of nitrous
acid, which is prepared in situ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite. Benzylamine reacts with
nitrous acid to form unstable diazonium salt, which in turn gives alcohol with the evolution of
nitrogen gas.
On the other hand, aniline reacts with HNO2 at a low temperature to form stable diazonium
salt. Thus, nitrogen gas is not evolved.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION

(v) Aniline and N-methylaniline can be distinguished using the Carbylamine test. Primary
amines, on heating with chloroform and ethanolic potassium hydroxide, form foul-smelling
isocyanides or carbylamines. Aniline, being an aromatic primary amine, gives positive
carbylamine test. However, N-methylaniline, being a secondary amine does not.
Question 13.3:
Account for the following:
(i) pKb of aniline is more than that of methylamine.
(ii) Ethylamine is soluble in water whereas aniline is not.
(iii) Methylamine in water reacts with ferric chloride to precipitate hydrated ferric oxide.
(iv) Although amino group is o, p− directing in aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions,
aniline on nitration gives a substantial amount of m-nitroaniline.
(v) Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.
(vi) Diazonium salts of aromatic amines are more stable than those of aliphatic amines.
(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is preferred for synthesising primary amines.
Answer
(i) pKb of aniline is more than that of methylamine:
Aniline undergoes resonance and as a result, the electrons on the N-atom are delocalized over
the benzene ring. Therefore, the electrons on the N-atom are less available to donate.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
On the other hand, in case of methylamine (due to the +I effect of methyl group), the electron
density on the N-atom is increased. As a result, aniline is less basic than methylamine. Thus,
pKb of aniline is more than that of methylamine.
(ii) Ethylamine is soluble in water whereas aniline is not:
Ethylamine when added to water forms intermolecular H−bonds with water. Hence, it is
soluble in water.
But aniline does not undergo H−bonding with water to a very large extent due to the presence
of a large hydrophobic −C6H5 group. Hence, aniline is insoluble in water.
(iii) Methylamine in water reacts with ferric chloride to precipitate hydrated ferric
oxide:
Due to the +I effect of −CH3 group, methylamine is more basic than water. Therefore, in
water, methylamine produces OH− ions by accepting H+ ions from water.
Ferric chloride (FeCl3) dissociates in water to form Fe3+ and Cl− ions.
Then, OH− ion reacts with Fe3+ ion to form a precipitate of hydrated ferric oxide.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(iv) Although amino group is o,p− directing in aromatic electrophilic substitution
reactions, aniline on nitration gives a substantial amount of m-nitroaniline:
Nitration is carried out in an acidic medium. In an acidic medium, aniline is protonated to give
anilinium ion (which is meta-directing).
For this reason, aniline on nitration gives a substantial amount of m-nitroaniline.
(v) Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction:
A Friedel-Crafts reaction is carried out in the presence of AlCl3. But AlCl3 is acidic in nature,
while aniline is a strong base. Thus, aniline reacts with AlCl3 to form a salt (as shown in the
following equation).
Due to the positive charge on the N-atom, electrophilic substitution in the benzene ring is
deactivated. Hence, aniline does not undergo the Friedel-Crafts reaction.
(vi) Diazonium salts of aromatic amines are more stable than those of aliphatic
amines:
The diazonium ion undergoes resonance as shown below:
This resonance accounts for the stability of the diazonium ion. Hence, diazonium salts of
aromatic amines are more stable than those of aliphatic amines.
(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is preferred for synthesising primary amines:
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Gabriel phthalimide synthesis results in the formation of 1° amine only. 2° or 3° amines are
not formed in this synthesis. Thus, a pure 1° amine can be obtained. Therefore, Gabriel
phthalimide synthesis is preferred for synthesizing primary amines.
Question 13.4:
Arrange the following:
(i) In decreasing order of the pKbvalues:
C2H5NH2, C6H5NHCH3, (C2H5)2NH and C6H5NH2
(ii) In increasing order of basic strength:
C6H5NH2, C6H5N(CH3)2, (C2H5)2NH and CH3NH2
(iii) In increasing order of basic strength:
(a) Aniline, p-nitroaniline and p-toluidine
(b) C6H5NH2, C6H5NHCH3, C6H5CH2NH2.
(iv) In decreasing order of basic strength in gas phase:
C2H5NH2, (C2H5)2NH, (C2H5)3N and NH3
(v) In increasing order of boiling point:
C2H5OH, (CH3)2NH, C2H5NH2
(vi) In increasing order of solubility in water:
C6H5NH2, (C2H5)2NH, C2H5NH2.
Answer
(i) In C2H5NH2, only one −C2H5 group is present while in (C2H5)2NH, two −C2H5 groups are
present. Thus, the +I effect is more in (C2H5)2NH than in C2H5NH2. Therefore, the electron
density over the N-atom is more in (C2H5)2NH than in C2H5NH2. Hence, (C2H5)2NH is more
basic than C2H5NH2.
Also, both C6H5NHCH3 and C6H5NH2 are less basic than (C2H5)2NH and C2H5NH2 due to the
delocalization of the lone pair in the former two. Further, among C6H5NHCH3 and C6H5NH2, the
former will be more basic due to the +T effect of −CH3 group. Hence, the order of increasing
basicity of the given compounds is as follows:
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
C6H5NH2 < C6H5NHCH3 < C2H5NH2 < (C2H5)2NH
We know that the higher the basic strength, the lower is the pKb values.
C6H5NH2 > C6H5NHCH3 > C2H5NH2 > (C2H5)2NH
(ii) C6H5N(CH3)2 is more basic than C6H5NH2 due to the presence of the +I effect of two −CH3
groups in C6H5N(CH3)2. Further, CH3NH2 contains one −CH3 group while (C2H5)2NH contains
two −C2H5 groups. Thus, (C2H5)2 NH is more basic than C2H5NH2.
Now, C6H5N(CH3)2 is less basic than CH3NH2 because of the−R effect of −C6H5 group.
Hence, the increasing order of the basic strengths of the given compounds is as follows:
C6H5NH2 < C6H5N(CH3)2 < CH3NH2 < (C2H5)2NH
(iii) (a)
In p-toluidine, the presence of electron-donating −CH3 group increases the electron density on
the N-atom.
Thus, p-toluidine is more basic than aniline.
On the other hand, the presence of electron-withdrawing
−NO2 group decreases the electron density over the N−atom in p-nitroaniline. Thus, p-
nitroaniline is less basic than aniline.
Hence, the increasing order of the basic strengths of the given compounds is as follows:
p-Nitroaniline < Aniline < p-Toluidine
(b) C6H5NHCH3 is more basic than C6H5NH2 due to the presence of electron-donating −CH3
group in C6H5NHCH3.
Again, in C6H5NHCH3, −C6H5 group is directly attached to the N-atom. However, it is not so in
C6H5CH2NH2. Thus, in C6H5NHCH3, the −R effect of −C6H5 group decreases the electron density
over the N-atom. Therefore, C6H5CH2NH2 is more basic than C6H5NHCH3.
Hence, the increasing order of the basic strengths of the given compounds is as follows:
C6H5NH2 < C6H5NHCH3 < C6H5CH2NH2.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(iv) In the gas phase, there is no solvation effect. As a result, the basic strength mainly
depends upon the +I effect. The higher the +I effect, the stronger is the base. Also, the
greater the number of alkyl groups, the higher is the +I effect. Therefore, the given
compounds can be arranged in the decreasing order of their basic strengths in the gas phase
as follows:
(C2H5)3N > (C2H5)2NH > C2H5NH2 > NH3
(v) The boiling points of compounds depend on the extent of H-bonding present in that
compound. The more extensive the H-bonding in the compound, the higher is the boiling
point. (CH3)2NH contains only one H−atom whereas C2H5NH2 contains two H-atoms. Then,
C2H5NH2 undergoes more extensive H-bonding than (CH3)2NH. Hence, the boiling point of
C2H5NH2 is higher than that of (CH3)2NH.
Further, O is more electronegative than N. Thus, C2H5OH forms stronger H−bonds than
C2H5NH2. As a result, the boiling point of C2H5OH is higher than that of C2H5NH2 and (CH3)2NH.
Now, the given compounds can be arranged in the increasing order of their boiling points as
follows:
(CH3)2NH < C2H5NH2 < C2H5OH
(vi) The more extensive the H−bonding, the higher is the solubility. C2H5NH2 contains two H-
atoms whereas (C2H5)2NH contains only one H-atom. Thus, C2H5NH2 undergoes more
extensive H−bonding than (C2H5)2NH. Hence, the solubility in water of C2H5NH2 is more than
that of (C2H5)2NH.
Further, the solubility of amines decreases with increase in the molecular mass. This is
because the molecular mass of amines increases with an increase in the size of the
hydrophobic part. The molecular mass of C6H5NH2 is greater than that of C2H5NH2 and
(C2H5)2NH.
Hence, the increasing order of their solubility in water is as follows:
C6H5NH2 < (C2H5)2NH < C2H5NH2

AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Answer
Primary, secondary and tertiary amines can be identified and distinguished by Hinsberg’s test.
In this test, the amines are allowed to react with Hinsberg’s reagent, benzenesulphonyl
chloride (C6H5SO2Cl). The three types of amines react differently with Hinsberg’s reagent.
Therefore, they can be easily identified using Hinsberg’s reagent.
Primary amines react with benzenesulphonyl chloride to form N-alkylbenzenesulphonyl amide
which is soluble in alkali.
Due to the presence of a strong electron-withdrawing sulphonyl group in the sulphonamide,
the H−atom attached to nitrogen can be easily released as proton. So, it is acidic and
dissolves in alkali.
Secondary amines react with Hinsberg’s reagent to give a sulphonamide which is insoluble in
alkali.
There is no H−atom attached to the N-atom in the sulphonamide. Therefore, it is not acidic
and insoluble in alkali.
On the other hand, tertiary amines do not react with Hinsberg’s reagent at all.

(v) Ammonolysis (vi) Acetylation
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis.
Answer
(i) Carbylamine reaction
Carbylamine reaction is used as a test for the identification of primary amines. When aliphatic
and aromatic primary amines are heated with chloroform and ethanolic potassium hydroxide,
carbylamines (or isocyanides) are formed. These carbylamines have very unpleasant odours.
Secondary and tertiary amines do not respond to this test.
For example,
(ii) Diazotisation
Aromatic primary amines react with nitrous acid (prepared in situ from NaNO2 and a mineral
acid such as HCl) at low temperatures (273-278 K) to form diazonium salts. This conversion of
aromatic primary amines into diazonium salts is known as diazotization.
For example, on treatment with NaNO2 and HCl at 273−278 K, aniline produces
benzenediazonium chloride, with NaCl and H2O as by-products.
(iii) Hoffmann bromamide reaction
When an amide is treated with bromine in an aqueous or ethanolic solution of sodium
hydroxide, a primary amine with one carbon atom less than the original amide is produced.
This degradation reaction is known as Hoffmann bromamide reaction. This reaction involves
the migration of an alkyl or aryl group from the carbonyl carbon atom of the amide to the
nitrogen atom.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
For example,
(iv) Coupling reaction
The reaction of joining two aromatic rings through the −N=N−bond is known as coupling
reaction. Arenediazonium salts such as benzene diazonium salts react with phenol or aromatic
amines to form coloured azo compounds.
It can be observed that, the para-positions of phenol and aniline are coupled with the
diazonium salt. This reaction proceeds through electrophilic substitution.
(v) Ammonolysis
When an alkyl or benzyl halide is allowed to react with an ethanolic solution of ammonia, it
undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the halogen atom is replaced by an
amino (−NH2) group. This process of cleavage of the carbon-halogen bond is known as
ammonolysis.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
When this substituted ammonium salt is treated with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide,
amine is obtained.
Though primary amine is produced as the major product, this process produces a mixture of
primary, secondary and tertiary amines, and also a quaternary ammonium salt as shown.
(vi) Acetylation
Acetylation (or ethanoylation) is the process of introducing an acetyl group into a molecule.
Aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines undergo acetylation reaction by
nucleophilic substitution when treated with acid chlorides, anhydrides or esters. This reaction
involves the replacement of the hydrogen atom of −NH2 or > NH group by the acetyl group,
which in turn leads to the production of amides. To shift the equilibrium to the right hand side,
the HCl formed during the reaction is removed as soon as it is formed. This reaction is carried
out in the presence of a base (such as pyridine) which is stronger than the amine.

When amines react with benzoyl chloride, the reaction is also known as benzoylation.

(vii) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis
Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is a very useful method for the preparation of aliphatic primary
amines. It involves the treatment of phthalimide with ethanolic potassium hydroxide to form
potassium salt of phthalimide. This salt is further heated with alkyl halide, followed by alkaline
hydrolysis to yield the corresponding primary amine.

Question 13.12:
Why cannot aromatic primary amines be prepared by Gabriel phthalimide synthesis?
Answer
Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is used for the preparation of aliphatic primary amines. It
involves nucleophilic substitution (SN2) of alkyl halides by the anion formed by the
phthalimide.
But aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with the anion formed by the
phthalimide.
Hence, aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this process.

Question 13.14:
Give plausible explanation for each of the following:
(i) Why are amines less acidic than alcohols of comparable molecular masses?
(ii) Why do primary amines have higher boiling point than tertiary amines?
(iii) Why are aliphatic amines stronger bases than aromatic amines?
Answer
(i) Amines undergo protonation to give amide ion.
Similarly, alcohol loses a proton to give alkoxide ion.
AMINES ORGANIC FUNCTIONAL GROUP IV   NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
In an amide ion, the negative charge is on the N-atom whereas in alkoxide ion, the negative
charge is on the O-atom. Since O is more electronegative than N, O can accommodate the
negative charge more easily than N. As a result, the amide ion is less stable than the alkoxide
ion. Hence, amines are less acidic than alcohols of comparable molecular masses.
(ii) In a molecule of tertiary amine, there are no H−atoms whereas in primary amines, two
hydrogen atoms are present. Due to the presence of H−atoms, primary amines undergo
extensive intermolecular H−bonding.
As a result, extra energy is required to separate the molecules of primary amines. Hence,
primary amines have higher boiling points than tertiary amines.
(iii) Due to the −R effect of the benzene ring, the electrons on the N- atom are less available
in case of aromatic amines. Therefore, the electrons on the N-atom in aromatic amines cannot
be donated easily. This explains why aliphatic amines are stronger bases than aromatic
amines.

Question 14.1:
Glucose or sucrose are soluble in water but cyclohexane or benzene (simple six membered
ring compounds) are insoluble in water. Explain.
Answer
A glucose molecule contains five −OH groups while a sucrose molecule contains eight −OH
groups. Thus, glucose and sucrose undergo extensive H-bonding with water.
Hence, these are soluble in water.
But cyclohexane and benzene do not contain −OH groups. Hence, they cannot undergo H-
bonding with water and as a result, are insoluble in water.
Question 14.2:
What are the expected products of hydrolysis of lactose?
Answer
Lactose is composed of β-D galactose and β-D glucose. Thus, on hydrolysis, it gives β-D
galactose and β-D glucose.
Question 14.3:
How do you explain the absence of aldehyde group in the pentaacetate of D-glucose?
Answer
D-glucose reacts with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to form an oxime because of the presence of
aldehydic (−CHO) group or carbonyl carbon. This happens as the cyclic structure of glucose
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
forms an open chain structure in an aqueous medium, which then reacts with NH2OH to give
an oxime.
But pentaacetate of D-glucose does not react with NH2OH. This is because pentaacetate does
not form an open chain structure.
Question 14.4:
The melting points and solubility in water of amino acids are generally higher than that of the
corresponding halo acids. Explain.
Answer
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Both acidic (carboxyl) as well as basic (amino) groups are present in the same molecule of
amino acids. In aqueous solutions, the carboxyl group can lose a proton and the amino group
can accept a proton, thus giving rise to a dipolar ion known as a zwitter ion.
Due to this dipolar behaviour, they have strong electrostatic interactions within them and with
water. But halo-acids do not exhibit such dipolar behaviour.
For this reason, the melting points and the solubility of amino acids in water is higher than
those of the corresponding halo-acids.
Question 14.5:
Where does the water present in the egg go after boiling the egg?
Answer
When an egg is boiled, the proteins present inside the egg get denatured and coagulate. After
boiling the egg, the water present in it is absorbed by the coagulated protein through H-
bonding
Question 14.6:
Why cannot vitamin C be stored in our body?
Answer
Vitamin C cannot be stored in our body because it is water soluble. As a result, it is readily
excreted in the urine
Question 14.7:
What products would be formed when a nucleotide from DNA containing thymine is
hydrolysed?
Answer
When a nucleotide from the DNA containing thymine is hydrolyzed, thymine β-D-2-
deoxyribose and phosphoric acid are obtained as products
Question 14.8:
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
When RNA is hydrolysed, there is no relationship among the quantities of different bases
obtained. What does this fact suggest about the structure of RNA?
Answer
A DNA molecule is double-stranded in which the pairing of bases occurs. Adenine always pairs
with thymine, while cytosine always pairs with guanine. Therefore, on hydrolysis of DNA, the
quantity of adenine produced is equal to that of thymine and similarly, the quantity of cytosine
is equal to that of guanine.
But when RNA is hydrolyzed, there is no relationship among the quantities of the different
bases obtained. Hence, RNA is single-stranded
Question 14.1:
What are monosaccharides?
Answer
Monosaccharides are carbohydrates that cannot be hydrolysed further to give simpler units of
polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone.
Monosaccharides are classified on the bases of number of carbon atoms and the functional
group present in them. Monosaccharides containing an aldehyde group are known as aldoses
and those containing a keto group are known as ketoses. Monosaccharides are further
classified as trioses, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses, and heptoses according to the number of
carbon atoms they contain. For example, a ketose containing 3 carbon atoms is called
ketotriose and an aldose containing 3 carbon atoms is called aldotriose
Question 14.2:
What are reducing sugars?
Answer
Reducing sugars are carbohydrates that reduce Fehling’s solution and Tollen’s reagent. All
monosaccharides and disaccharides, excluding sucrose, are reducing sugars.
Question 14.3:
Write two main functions of carbohydrates in plants.

Question 14.5:
What do you understand by the term glycosidic linkage?
Answer
Glycosidic linkage refers to the linkage formed between two monosaccharide units through an
oxygen atom by the loss of a water molecule.
For example, in a sucrose molecule, two monosaccharide units, ∝-glucose and β-fructose, are
joined together by a glycosidic linkage.
Question 14.6:
What is glycogen? How is it different from starch?
Answer
Glycogen is a carbohydrate (polysaccharide). In animals, carbohydrates are stored as
glycogen.
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION

Starch is a carbohydrate consisting of two components − amylose (15 − 20%) and
amylopectin (80 − 85%).
However, glycogen consists of only one component whose structure is similar to amylopectin.
Also, glycogen is more branched than amylopectin
Question 14.7:
What are the hydrolysis products of (i) sucrose and (ii) lactose?
Answer
(i) On hydrolysis, sucrose gives one molecule of ∝-D glucose and one molecule of β- D-

Question 14.8:
What is the basic structural difference between starch and cellulose?
Answer
Starch consists of two components − amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a long linear chain
of ∝−D−(+)−glucose units joined by C1−C4 glycosidic linkage (∝-link).
Amylopectin is a branched-chain polymer of ∝-D-glucose units, in which the chain is formed
by C1−C4 glycosidic linkage and the branching occurs by C1−C6 glycosidic linkage.

(iii) On being treated with HNO3, D-glucose get oxidised to give saccharic acid.
Question 14.10:
Enumerate the reactions of D-glucose which cannot be explained by its open chain structure.
Answer
(1) Aldehydes give 2, 4-DNP test, Schiff’s test, and react with NaHSO4 to form the hydrogen
sulphite addition product. However, glucose does not undergo these reactions.
(2) The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine. This indicates that a free
−CHO group is absent from glucose.
(3) Glucose exists in two crystalline forms − ∝ and
β. The
-form (m.p. = 419 K) crystallises
from a concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K and the β-form (m.p = 423 K) crystallises
from a hot and saturated aqueous solution at 371 K. This behaviour cannot be explained by
the open chain structure of glucose
Question 14.11:
What are essential and non-essential amino acids? Give two examples of each type.
Answer
Essential amino acids are required by the human body, but they cannot be synthesised in the
body. They must be taken through food. For example: valine and leucine
Non-essential amino acids are also required by the human body, but they can be synthesised
in the body. For example: glycine, and alanine
Question 14.12:
Define the following as related to proteins
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(i) Peptide linkage (ii) Primary structure (iii) Denaturation.
Answer
(i) Peptide linkage:
The amide formed between −COOH group of one molecule of an amino acid and −NH2 group
of another molecule of the amino acid by the elimination of a water molecule is called a
peptide linkage.
(ii) Primary structure:
The primary structure of protein refers to the specific sequence in which various amino acids
are present in it, i.e., the sequence of linkages between amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
The sequence in which amino acids are arranged is different in each protein. A change in the
sequence creates a different protein.
(iii) Denaturation:
In a biological system, a protein is found to have a unique 3-dimensional structure and a
unique biological activity. In such a situation, the protein is called native protein. However,
when the native protein is subjected to physical changes such as change in temperature or
chemical changes such as change in pH, its H-bonds are disturbed. This disturbance unfolds
the globules and uncoils the helix. As a result, the protein loses its biological activity. This loss
of biological activity by the protein is called denaturation. During denaturation, the secondary
and the tertiary structures of the protein get destroyed, but the primary structure remains
unaltered.
One of the examples of denaturation of proteins is the coagulation of egg white when an egg
is boiled.
Question 14.13:
What are the common types of secondary structure of proteins?
Answer
There are two common types of secondary structure of proteins:
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(i) ∝-helix structure
(ii) β-pleated sheet structure
∝- Helix structure:
In this structure, the −NH group of an amino acid residue forms H-bond with the
group of the adjacent turn of the right-handed screw (∝-helix).
β-pleated sheet structure:
This structure is called so because it looks like the pleated folds of drapery. In this structure,
all the peptide chains are stretched out to nearly the maximum extension and then laid side by
side. These peptide chains are held together by intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
Question 14.14:
What type of bonding helps in stabilising the ∝-helix structure of proteins?
Answer
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
The H-bonds formed between the −NH group of each amino acid residue and
group of the adjacent turns of the ∝-helix help in stabilising the helix.
Question 14.15:
Differentiate between globular and fibrous proteins.
Answer
Fibrous protein
Globular protein
It is a fibre-like structure
formed by the polypeptide
chain. These proteins are held
together by strong hydrogen
and disulphide bonds.
The polypeptide chain
in this protein is folded
around itself, giving
rise to a spherical
structure.
It is usually insoluble in water.
It is usually soluble in
water.
Fibrous proteins are usually
used for structural purposes.
For example, keratin is present
in nails and hair; collagen in
tendons; and myosin in
muscles.
All enzymes are
globular proteins.
Some hormones such
as insulin are also
globular proteins.
Question 14.16:
How do you explain the amphoteric behaviour of amino acids?
Answer
In aqueous solution, the carboxyl group of an amino acid can lose a proton and the amino
group can accept a proton to give a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion.
Therefore, in zwitter ionic form, the amino acid can act both as an acid and as a base.
BIOMOLECULES NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Thus, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour.
Question 14.17:
What are enzymes?
Answer
Enzymes are proteins that catalyse biological reactions. They are very specific in nature and
catalyse only a particular reaction for a particular substrate. Enzymes are usually named after
the particular substrate or class of substrate and some times after the particular reaction.
For example, the enzyme used to catalyse the hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as
maltase.
Again, the enzymes used to catalyse the oxidation of one substrate with the simultaneous
reduction of another substrate are named as oxidoreductase enzymes.
The name of an enzyme ends with ‘− ase’
Question 14.18:
What is the effect of denaturation on the structure of proteins?
Answer
As a result of denaturation, globules get unfolded and helixes get uncoiled. Secondary and
tertiary structures of protein are destroyed, but the primary structures remain unaltered. It
can be said that during denaturation, secondary and tertiary-structured proteins get converted
into primary-structured proteins. Also, as the secondary and tertiary structures of a protein
are destroyed, the enzyme loses its activity.
Question 14.19:
How are vitamins classified? Name the vitamin responsible for the coagulation of blood.
Answer
On the basis of their solubility in water or fat, vitamins are classified into two groups.

Vitamin K is responsible for the coagulation of blood
Question 14.20:
Why are vitamin A and vitamin C essential to us? Give their important sources.
Answer
The deficiency of vitamin A leads to xerophthalmia (hardening of the cornea of the eye) and
night blindness. The deficiency of vitamin C leads to scurvy (bleeding gums).
The sources of vitamin A are fish liver oil, carrots, butter, and milk. The sources of vitamin C
are citrus fruits, amla, and green leafy vegetables
Question 14.21:
What are nucleic acids? Mention their two important functions.
Answer
Nucleic acids are biomolecules found in the nuclei of all living cells, as one of the constituents
of chromosomes. There are mainly two types of nucleic acids − deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Nucleic acids are also known as polynucleotides as they are long-
chain polymers of nucleotides.
Two main functions of nucleic acids are:
(i) DNA is responsible for the transmission of inherent characters from one generation to the
next. This process of transmission is called heredity.
(ii) Nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) are responsible for protein synthesis in a cell. Even
though the proteins are actually synthesised by the various RNA molecules in a cell, the
message for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA
Question 14.22:

Question 16.1:
Why do we need to classify drugs in different ways?
Answer
CHEMISTRY IN ACTION NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
The classification of drugs and the reasons for classification are as follows:
(i) On the basis of pharmacological effect:
This classification provides doctors the whole range of drugs available for the treatment of a
particular type of problem. Hence, such a classification is very useful to doctors.
(ii) On the basis of drug action:
This classification is based on the action of a drug on a particular biochemical process. Thus,
this classification is important.
(iii) On the basis of chemical structure:
This classification provides the range of drugs sharing common structural features and often
having similar pharmacological activity.
(iv) On the basis of molecular targets:
This classification provides medicinal chemists the drugs having the same mechanism of action
on targets. Hence, it is the most useful to medicinal chemists
Question 16.2:
Explain the term target molecules or drug targets as used in medicinal chemistry.
Answer
In medicinal chemistry, drug targets refer to the key molecules involved in certain metabolic
pathways that result in specific diseases. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are
examples of drug targets.
Drugs are chemical agents designed to inhibit these target molecules by binding with the
active sites of the key molecules

Question 16.7:
While antacids and antiallergic drugs interfere with the function of histamines, why do these
not interfere with the function of each other?
Answer
Specific drugs affect particular receptors. Antacids and anti-allergic drugs work on different
receptors. This is the reason why antacids and anti-allergic drugs do not interfere with each
other’s functions, but interfere with the functions of histamines

Question 16.9:
What is meant by the term ‘broad spectrum antibiotics’? Explain.
Answer
Antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
are known as broad spectrum antibiotics. Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic.
It can be used for the treatment of typhoid, dysentery, acute fever, pneumonia, meningitis,

Antiseptics and disinfectants are effective against micro-organisms. However, antiseptics are
applied to the living tissues such as wounds, cuts, ulcers, and diseased skin surfaces, while
disinfectants are applied to inanimate objects such as floors, drainage system, instruments,
etc. Disinfectants are harmful to the living tissues.
Iodine is an example of a strong antiseptic. Tincture of iodine (2 − 3 percent of solution of
iodine in alcohol − water mixture) is applied to wounds. 1 percent solution of phenol is used as
a disinfectant
Question 16.11:
CHEMISTRY IN ACTION NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Why are cimetidine and ranitidine better antacids than sodium hydrogen carbonate or
magnesium or aluminium hydroxide?
Answer
Antacids such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminium
hydroxide work by neutralising the excess hydrochloric acid present in the stomach. However,
the root cause for the release of excess acid remains untreated.
Cimetidine and rantidine are better antacids as they control the root cause of acidity. These
drugs prevent the interaction of histamine with the receptors present in the stomach walls.
Consequently, there is a decrease in the amount of acid released by the stomach. This is why
cimetidine and rantidine are better antacids than sodium hydrogen carbonate, magnesium
hydroxide, and aluminium hydroxide
Question 16.12:

How are synthetic detergents better than soap?
Answer
Soaps work in soft water. However, they are not effective in hard water. In contrast, synthetic
detergents work both in soft water and hard water.
Therefore, synthetic detergents are better than soaps
Question 16.21:
Explain the following terms with suitable examples
(i) Cationic detergents
(ii) Anionic detergents and
(iii) Non-ionic detergents
Answer
(i) Cationic detergent
Cationic detergents are quaternary ammonium salts of acetates, chlorides, or bromides. These
are called cationic detergents because the cationic part of these detergents contains a long
hydrocarbon chain and a positive charge on the N atom.
For example: cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(ii) Anionic detergents
Anionic detergents are of two types:
1.Sodium alkyl sulphates: These detergents are sodium salts of long chain alcohols. They are
prepared by first treating these alcohols with concentrated sulphuric acid and then with
sodium hydroxide. Examples of these detergents include sodium lauryl sulphate
(C11H23CH2OSO3
−Na+) and sodium stearyl sulphate (C17H35CH2OSO3
−Na+).

2.Sodium alkylbenzenesulphonates: These detergents are sodium salts of long chain
alkylbenzenesulphonic acids. They are prepared by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with
long chain alkyl halides or alkenes. The obtained product is first treated with concentrated
sulphuric acid and then with sodium hydroxide. Sodium 4-(1-dodecy) benzenesulphonate
(SDS) is an example of anionic detergents.
(iii) Non-ionic detergents
Molecules of these detergents do not contain any ions. These detergents are esters of alcohols
having high molecular mass. They are obtained by reacting polyethylene glycol and stearic
acid.
Question 16.22:
What are biodegradable and non-biodegradable detergents? Give one example of each.
Answer
Detergents that can be degraded by bacteria are called biodegradable detergents. Such
detergents have straight hydrocarbon chains. For example: sodium lauryl sulphate
Detergents that cannot be degraded by bacteria are called non-biodegradable detergents.
Such detergents have highly-branched hydrocarbon chains. For example: sodium -4- (1, 3, 5,
7- tetra methyl octyl) benzene sulphonate
Question 16.23:
Why do soaps not work in hard water?
Answer
Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids. Hard water contains calcium
and magnesium ions. When soaps are dissolved in hard water, these ions displace sodium or
potassium from their salts and form insoluble calcium or magnesium salts of fatty acids. These
insoluble salts separate as scum.
This is the reason why soaps do not work in hard water

Question 16.24:
Can you use soaps and synthetic detergents to check the hardness of water?
Answer
Soaps get precipitated in hard water, but not in soft water. Therefore, soaps can be used for
checking the hardness of water.
However, synthetic detergents do not get precipitated either in hard water or in soft water.
Therefore, synthetic detergents cannot be used for checking the hardness of water
Question 16.25:
Explain the cleansing action of soaps.
Answer
Soap molecules form micelles around an oil droplet (dirt) in such a way that the hydrophobic
parts of the stearate ions attach themselves to the oil droplet and the hydrophilic parts project
outside the oil droplet. Due to the polar nature of the hydrophilic parts, the stearate ions
(along with the dirt) are pulled into water, thereby removing the dirt from the cloth.

These polymers are formed of long straight chains. They can be depicted as:
For e.g., high density polythene (HDP), polyvinyl chloride, etc.
2. Branched chain polymers:
These polymers are basically linear chain polymers with some branches. These polymers are
represented as:
For e.g., low density polythene (LDP), amylopectin, etc.
3. Cross-linked or Network polymers:
These polymers have many cross-linking bonds that give rise to a network-like structure.
These polymers contain bi-functional and tri-functional monomers and strong covalent bonds
between various linear polymer chains. Examples of such polymers include bakelite and
melmac.

Question 15.6:
Arrange the following polymers in increasing order of their intermolecular forces.
(i) Nylon 6, 6, Buna-S, Polythene.
(ii) Nylon 6, Neoprene, Polyvinyl chloride.
Answer
Different types of polymers have different intermolecular forces of attraction. Elastomers or
rubbers have the weakest while fibres have the strongest intermolecular forces of attraction.
Plastics have intermediate intermolecular forces of attraction. Hence, the increasing order of
the intermolecular forces of the given polymers is as follows:
(i) Buna − S < polythene < Nylon 6, 6
(ii) Neoprene < polyvinyl chloride < Nylon 6
Question 15.1:
Explain the terms polymer and monomer.
Answer
Polymers are high molecular mass macromolecules composed of repeating structural units
derived from monomers. Polymers have a high molecular mass (103 − 107 u). In a polymer,
various monomer units are joined by strong covalent bonds. Polymers can be natural as well
as synthetic. Polythene, rubber, and nylon 6, 6 are examples of polymers.
Monomers are simple, reactive molecules that combine with each other in large numbers
through covalent bonds to give rise to polymers. For example, ethene, propene, styrene, vinyl
chloride

Question 15.2:
What are natural and synthetic polymers? Give two examples of each type.
Answer
Natural polymers are polymers that are found in nature. They are formed by plants and
animals. Examples include protein, cellulose, starch, etc.
Synthetic polymers are polymers made by human beings. Examples include plastic
(polythene), synthetic fibres (nylon 6, 6), synthetic rubbers (Buna − S).
Question 15.3:
Distinguish between the terms homopolymer and copolymer and give an example of each.
Answer
Homopolymer
Copolymer
The polymers that are formed by
the polymerization of a single
monomer are known as
homopolymers. In other words, the
repeating units of homopolymers
are derived only from one
monomer. For example, polythene
is a homopolymer of ethane.
The polymers whose
repeating units are
derived from two types of
monomers are known as
copolymers. For example,
Buna−S is a copolymer of
1, 3-butadiene and
styrene.
Question 15.4:
How do you explain the functionality of a monomer?
Answer
The functionality of a monomer is the number of binding sites that is/are present in that
monomer.
For example, the functionality of monomers such as ethene and propene is one and that of 1,
3-butadiene and adipic acid is two.
Question 15.5:
Define the term polymerisation.
Answer
POLYMERS:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Polymerization is the process of forming high molecular mass (103 − 107 u)
macromolecules, which consist of repeating structural units derived from monomers. In a
polymer, various monomer units are joined by strong covalent bonds.
Question 15.6:
, a homopolymer or copolymer?
Answer
is a homopolymer because it is obtained from a single monomer unit,
NH2−CHR−COOH
Question 15.7:
In which classes, the polymers are classified on the basis of molecular forces?
Answer
On the basis of magnitude of intermolecular forces present in polymers, they are classified into
the following groups:
(i) Elastomers
(ii) Fibres
(iii) Thermoplastic polymers
(iv) Thermosetting polymers
Question 15.8:
How can you differentiate between addition and condensation polymerisation?
Answer
Addition polymerization is the process of repeated addition of monomers, possessing double or
triple bonds to form polymers. For example, polythene is formed by addition polymerization of
ethene.
Condensation polymerization is the process of formation of polymers by repeated
condensation reactions between two different bi-functional or tri-functional monomers. A small
molecule such as water or hydrochloric acid is eliminated in each condensation. For example,
nylon 6, 6 is formed by condensation polymerization of hexamethylenediamine and adipic
acid.

Question 15.9:
Explain the term copolymerisation and give two examples.
Answer
The process of forming polymers from two or more different monomeric units is called
copolymerization. Multiple units of each monomer are present in a copolymer. The process of
forming polymer Buna−S from 1, 3-butadiene and styrene is an example of copolymerization
Nylon 6, 6 is also a copolymer formed by hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid.
Question 15.10:

Question 15.11:
Define thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers with two examples of each.
Answer
Thermoplastic polymers are linear (slightly branched) long chain polymers, which can be
repeatedly softened and hardened on heating. Hence, they can be modified again and again.
Examples include polythene, polystyrene.
Thermosetting polymers are cross-linked or heavily branched polymers which get hardened
during the molding process. These plastics cannot be softened again on heating. Examples of
thermosetting plastics include bakelite, urea-formaldehyde resins

radical addition polymerisation.
Answer
One common initiator used in free radical addition polymerization is benzoyl peroxide. Its
structure is given below.
Question 15.14:
How does the presence of double bonds in rubber molecules influence their
structure and reactivity?
Answer
Natural rubber is a linear cis-polyisoprene in which the double bonds are present between C2
and C3 of the isoprene units.
Because of this cis-configuration, intermolecular interactions between the various strands of
isoprene are quite weak. As a result, various strands in natural rubber are arranged randomly.
Hence, it shows elasticity
Question 15.15:
Discuss the main purpose of vulcanisation of rubber.
POLYMERS:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI   PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Answer
Natural rubber though useful has some problems associated with its use. These limitations are
discussed below:
1. Natural rubber is quite soft and sticky at room temperature. At elevated temperatures (>
335 K), it becomes even softer. At low temperatures (< 283 K), it becomes brittle. Thus, to
maintain its elasticity, natural rubber is generally used in the temperature range of 283 K-335
2. It has the capacity to absorb large amounts of water.
3. It has low tensile strength and low resistance to abrasion.
4. It is soluble in non-polar solvents.
5. It is easily attacked by oxidizing agents.
Vulcanization of natural rubber is done to improve upon all these properties. In this process, a
mixture of raw rubber with sulphur and appropriate additive is heated at a temperature range
between 373 K and 415 K.
