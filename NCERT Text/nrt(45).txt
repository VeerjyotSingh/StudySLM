Question 1.1:
Why are solids rigid?
The intermolecular forces of attraction that are present in solids are very strong. The
constituent particles of solids cannot move from their positions i.e., they have fixed positions.
However, they can oscillate about their mean positions. This is the reason solids are rigid.
Question 1.2:
Why do solids have a definite volume?
The intermolecular forces of attraction that are present in solids are very strong. The
constituent particles of solids have fixed positions i.e., they are rigid. Hence, solids have a
definite volume.
Question 1.3:
Classify the following as amorphous or crystalline solids:
Polyurethane, naphthalene, benzoic acid, teflon, potassium nitrate, cellophane, polyvinyl
chloride, fibre glass, copper
Amorphous solids
Polyurethane, teflon, cellophane, polyvinyl chloride, fibre glass
Crystalline solids
Naphthalene, benzoic acid, potassium nitrate, copper
Question 1.4:
Why is glass considered a super cooled liquid?
Similar to liquids, glass has a tendency to flow, though very slowly. Therefore, glass is
considered as a super cooled liquid. This is the reason that glass windows and doors are
slightly thicker at the bottom than at the top.
Question 1.5:
Refractive index of a solid is observed to have the same value along all directions. Comment
on the nature of this solid. Would it show cleavage property?
An isotropic solid has the same value of physical properties when measured along different
directions. Therefore, the given solid, having the same value of refractive index along all
directions, is isotropic in nature. Hence, the solid is an amorphous solid.

extremely high temperature. What type of solid is it?
The given properties are the properties of a covalent or network solid. Therefore, the given
solid is a covalent or network solid. Examples of such solids include diamond (C) and quartz
(SiO2).
Question 1.8:
Ionic solids conduct electricity in molten state but not in solid state. Explain.
In ionic compounds, electricity is conducted by ions. In solid state, ions are held together by
strong electrostatic forces and are not free to move about within the solid. Hence, ionic solids

do not conduct electricity in solid state. However, in molten state or in solution form, the ions
are free to move and can conduct electricity.
Question 1.9:

Metallic solids are electrical conductors, malleable, and ductile.
Question 1.10:

The significance of a lattice point is that each lattice point represents one constituent particle
of a solid which may be an atom, a molecule (group of atom), or an ion.
Question 1.11:
Name the parameters that characterize a unit cell.
The six parameters that characterise a unit cell are as follows.

An end-centred unit cell contains particles at the corners and one at the centre of any two
opposite faces.
Question 1.13:
Explain how much portion of an atom located at (i) corner and (ii) body-centre of a cubic unit
cell is part of its neighbouring unit cell.
(i)An atom located at the corner of a cubic unit cell is shared by eight adjacent unit cells.
Therefore,
portion of the atom is shared by one unit cell.
(ii)An atom located at the body centre of a cubic unit cell is not shared by its neighbouring
unit cell. Therefore, the atom belongs only to the unit cell in which it is present i.e., its
contribution to the unit cell is 1.
Question 1.14:
What is the two dimensional coordination number of a molecule in square close packed layer?
In square close-packed layer, a molecule is in contact with four of its neighbours. Therefore,
the two-dimensional coordination number of a molecule in square close-packed layer is 4.
Question 1.15:
A compound forms hexagonal close-packed structure. What is the total number of voids in 0.5
mol of it? How many of these are tetrahedral voids?
Number of close-packed particles = 0.5 × 6.022 × 1023 = 3.011 × 1023
Therefore, number of octahedral voids = 3.011 × 1023
And, number of tetrahedral voids = 2 × 3.011 × 1023 = 6.022 ×1023
SOLID STATE : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Therefore, total number of voids = 3.011 × 1023 + 6.022 × 1023 = 9.033 × 1023
Question 1.16:
A compound is formed by two elements M and N. The element N forms ccp and atoms of M
occupy 1/3rd of tetrahedral voids. What is the formula of the compound?
The ccp lattice is formed by the atoms of the element N.
Here, the number of tetrahedral voids generated is equal to twice the number of atoms of the
element N.
According to the question, the atoms of element M occupy
of the tetrahedral voids.
Therefore, the number of atoms of M is equal to
of the number
of atoms of N.
Therefore, ratio of the number of atoms of M to that of N is M: N
Thus, the formula of the compound is M2 N3.
Question 1.17:
Which of the following lattices has the highest packing efficiency (i) simple cubic (ii) body-
centred cubic and (iii) hexagonal close-packed lattice?
Hexagonal close-packed lattice has the highest packing efficiency of 74%. The packing
efficiencies of simple cubic and body-centred cubic lattices are 52.4% and 68% respectively.
Question 1.18:
An element with molar mass 2.7 × 10-2 kg mol-1 forms a cubic unit cell with edge length 405
pm. If its density is 2.7 × 103 kg m−3, what is the nature of the cubic unit cell?
It is given that density of the element, d = 2.7 × 103 kg m−3
Molar mass, M = 2.7 × 10−2 kg mol−1
Edge length, a = 405 pm = 405 × 10−12 m
SOLID STATE : NCERT SOLUTION

= 4.05 × 10−10 m
It is known that, Avogadro’s number, NA = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1
Applying the relation,
This implies that four atoms of the element are present per unit cell. Hence, the unit cell is
face-centred cubic (fcc) or cubic close-packed (ccp).
Question 1.19:
What type of defect can arise when a solid is heated? Which physical property is affected by it
and in what way?
When a solid is heated, vacancy defect can arise. A solid crystal is said to have vacancy defect
when some of the lattice sites are vacant.
Vacancy defect leads to a decrease in the density of the solid.
Question 1.20:
What type of stoichiometric defect is shown by:
(i) ZnS (ii) AgBr
i) ZnS shows Frenkel defect.
(ii) AgBr shows Frenkel defect as well as Schottky defect.
Question 1.21:
Explain how vacancies are introduced in an ionic solid when a cation of higher valence is
added as an impurity in it.
SOLID STATE : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
When a cation of higher valence is added to an ionic solid as an impurity to it, the cation of
higher valence replaces more than one cation of lower valence so as to keep the crystal
electrically neutral. As a result, some sites become vacant. For example, when Sr2+ is added
to NaCl, each Sr2+ ion replaces two Na+ ions. However, one Sr2+ ion occupies the site of one
Na+ ion and the other site remains vacant. Hence, vacancies are introduced.
Question 1.22:
Ionic solids, which have anionic vacancies due to metal excess defect, develop colour. Explain
with the help of a suitable example
The colour develops because of the presence of electrons in the anionic sites. These electrons
absorb energy from the visible part of radiation and get excited.
For example, when crystals of NaCl are heated in an atmosphere of sodium vapours, the
sodium atoms get deposited on the surface of the crystal and the chloride ions from the
crystal diffuse to the surface to form NaCl with the deposited Na atoms. During this process,
the Na atoms on the surface lose electrons to form Na+ ions and the released electrons diffuse
into the crystal to occupy the vacant anionic sites. These electrons get excited by absorbing
energy from the visible light and impart yellow colour to the crystals.
Question 1.23:
A group 14 element is to be converted into n-type semiconductor by doping it with a suitable
impurity. To which group should this impurity belong?
An n-type semiconductor conducts because of the presence of extra electrons. Therefore, a
group 14 element can be converted to n-type semiconductor by doping it with a group 15
element.
Question 1.24:
What type of substances would make better permanent magnets, ferromagnetic or
ferrimagnetic. Justify your answer.
Ferromagnetic substances would make better permanent magnets.
In solid state, the metal ions of ferromagnetic substances are grouped together into small
regions. These regions are called domains and each domain acts as a tiny magnet. In an
unmagnetised piece of a ferromagnetic substance, the domains are randomly oriented. As a
result, the magnetic moments of the domains get cancelled. However, when the substance is
placed in a magnetic field, all the domains get oriented in the direction of the magnetic field
and a strong magnetic effect is produced.
The ordering of the domains persists even after the removal of the magnetic field. Thus, the
ferromagnetic substance becomes a permanent magnet.

Question 1.1:
Define the term 'amorphous'. Give a few examples of amorphous solids.
Amorphous solids are the solids whose constituent particles are of irregular shapes and have
short range order. These solids are isotropic in nature and melt over a range of temperature.
Therefore, amorphous solids are sometimes called pseudo solids or super cooled liquids. They
do not have definite heat of fusion. When cut with a sharp-edged tool, they cut into two pieces
with irregular surfaces. Examples of amorphous solids include glass, rubber, and plastic.
Question 1.2:
What makes a glass different from a solid such as quartz? Under what conditions could quartz
be converted into glass?
The arrangement of the constituent particles makes glass different from quartz. In glass, the
constituent particles have short range order, but in quartz, the constituent particles have both
long range and short range orders.
Quartz can be converted into glass by heating and then cooling it rapidly.

Question 1.5:
How can you determine the atomic mass of an unknown metal if you know its density and the
dimension of its unit cell? Explain.
By knowing the density of an unknown metal and the dimension of its unit cell, the atomic
mass of the metal can be determined.
Let ‘a’ be the edge length of a unit cell of a crystal, ‘d’ be the density of the metal, ‘m’ be the
atomic mass of the metal and ‘z’ be the number of atoms in the unit cell.
Now, density of the unit cell
[Since mass of the unit cell = Number of atoms in the unit cell × Atomic mass]
[Volume of the unit cell = (Edge length of the cubic unit cell)3]
From equation (i), we have:
Now, mass of the metal (m)

Question 1.6:
'Stability of a crystal is reflected in the magnitude of its melting point'. Comment. Collect
melting points of solid water, ethyl alcohol, diethyl ether and methane from a data book. What
can you say about the intermolecular forces between these molecules?
Higher the melting point, greater is the intermolecular force of attraction and greater is the
stability. A substance with higher melting point is more stable than a substance with lower
melting point.
The melting points of the given substances are:
Solid water → 273 K
Ethyl alcohol → 158.8 K
Diethyl ether → 156.85 K
Methane → 89.34 K
Now, on observing the values of the melting points, it can be said that among the given
substances, the intermolecular force in solid water is the strongest and that in methane is the
weakest.

A 2-D hexagonal close-packing contains two types of triangular voids (a and b) as
shown in figure 1. Let us call this 2-D structure as layer A. Now, particles are kept in
the voids present in layer A (it can be easily observed from figures 2 and 3 that only
one of the voids will be occupied in the process, i.e., either a or b). Let us call the

particles or spheres present in the voids of layer A as layer B. Now, two types of voids
are present in layer B (c and d). Unlike the voids present in layer A, the two types of
voids present in layer B are not similar. Void c is surrounded by 4 spheres and is called
the tetrahedral void. Void d is surrounded by 6 spheres and is called the octahedral
void.

Now, the next layer can be placed over layer B in 2 ways.
Case 1: When the third layer (layer C) is placed over the second one (layer B) in
such a manner that the spheres of layer C occupy the tetrahedral voids c.
In this case we get hexagonal close-packing. This is shown in figure 4. In figure 4.1, layer B is
present over the voids a and layer C is present over the voids c. In figure 4.2, layer B is
present over the voids b and layer C is present over the voids c. It can be observed from the
figure that in this arrangement, the spheres present in layer C are present directly above the

layer C is present over the voids d. In figure 5.2, layer B is present over the voids b and layer
C is present over the voids d. It can be observed from the figure that the arrangement of
particles in layer C is completely different from that in layers A or B. When the fourth layer is
kept over the third layer, the arrangement of particles in this layer is similar to that in layer A.

Question 1.9:
Explain
(i) The basis of similarities and differences between metallic and ionic crystals.
(ii) Ionic solids are hard and brittle.
(i) The basis of similarities between metallic and ionic crystals is that both these crystal types
are held by the electrostatic force of attraction. In metallic crystals, the electrostatic force acts
between the positive ions and the electrons. In ionic crystals, it acts between the oppositely-
charged ions. Hence, both have high melting points.
The basis of differences between metallic and ionic crystals is that in metallic crystals, the
electrons are free to move and so, metallic crystals can conduct electricity. However, in ionic
crystals, the ions are not free to move. As a result, they cannot conduct electricity. However,
in molten state or in aqueous solution, they do conduct electricity.
(ii) The constituent particles of ionic crystals are ions. These ions are held together in three-
dimensional arrangements by the electrostatic force of attraction. Since the electrostatic force
of attraction is very strong, the charged ions are held in fixed positions. This is the reason why
ionic crystals are hard and brittle.

It is given that the atoms of Q are present at the corners of the cube.
Therefore, number of atoms of Q in one unit cell
It is also given that the atoms of P are present at the body-centre.
Therefore, number of atoms of P in one unit cell = 1
This means that the ratio of the number of P atoms to the number of Q atoms, P:Q = 1:1
Hence, the formula of the compound is PQ.
The coordination number of both P and Q is 8.

Question 1.16:
Analysis shows that nickel oxide has the formula Ni0.98O1.00. What fractions of nickel exist as
Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions?
The formula of nickel oxide is Ni0.98O1.00.
Therefore, the ratio of the number of Ni atoms to the number of O atoms,
Ni : O = 0.98 : 1.00 = 98 : 100
Now, total charge on 100 O2− ions = 100 × (−2)
= −200
Let the number of Ni2+ ions be x.
So, the number of Ni3+ ions is 98 − x.
Now, total charge on Ni2+ ions = x(+2)
= +2x
And, total charge on Ni3+ ions = (98 − x)(+3)

= 294 − 3x
Since, the compound is neutral, we can write:
2x + (294 − 3x) + (−200) = 0
⇒ −x + 94 = 0
⇒ x = 94
Therefore, number of Ni2+ ions = 94
And, number of Ni3+ ions = 98 − 94 = 4
Hence, fraction of nickel that exists as Ni2+
= 0.959
And, fraction of nickel that exists as

Alternatively, fraction of nickel that exists as Ni3+ = 1 − 0.959

Question 1.17:
What is a semiconductor? Describe the two main types of semiconductors and contrast their
conduction mechanism.
Semiconductors are substances having conductance in the intermediate range of 10-6 to 104
ohm−1m−1.
The two main types of semiconductors are:
(i) n-type semiconductor
(ii) p-type semiconductor
n-type semiconductor: The semiconductor whose increased conductivity is a result of
negatively-charged electrons is called an n-type semiconductor. When the crystal of a group
14 element such as Si or Ge is doped with a group 15 element such as P or As, an n-type
semiconductor is generated.
Si and Ge have four valence electrons each. In their crystals, each atom forms four covalent
bonds. On the other hand, P and As contain five valence electrons each. When Si or Ge is
doped with P or As, the latter occupies some of the lattice sites in the crystal. Four out of five
SOLID STATE : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
electrons are used in the formation of four covalent bonds with four neighbouring Si or Ge
atoms. The remaining fifth electron becomes delocalised and increases the conductivity of the
doped Si or Ge.
p-type semiconductor: The semiconductor whose increased in conductivity is a result of
electron hole is called a p-type semiconductor. When a crystal of group 14 elements such as Si
or Ge is doped with a group 13 element such as B, Al, or Ga (which contains only three
valence electrons), a p-type of semiconductor is generated.
When a crystal of Si is doped with B, the three electrons of B are used in the formation of
three covalent bonds and an electron hole is created. An electron from the neighbouring atom
can come and fill this electron hole, but in doing so, it would leave an electron hole at its
original position. The process appears as if the electron hole has moved in the direction
opposite to that of the electron that filled it. Therefore, when an electric field is applied,
electrons will move toward the positively-charged plate through electron holes. However, it
will appear as if the electron holes are positively-charged and are moving toward the
negatively- charged plate.
Question 1.18:
Non-stoichiometric cuprous oxide, Cu2O can be prepared in laboratory. In this oxide, copper to
oxygen ratio is slightly less than 2:1. Can you account for the fact that this substance is a p-
type semiconductor?
In the cuprous oxide (Cu2O) prepared in the laboratory, copper to oxygen ratio is slightly less
than 2:1. This means that the number of Cu+ ions is slightly less than twice the number of O2−

ions. This is because some Cu+ ions have been replaced by Cu2+ ions. Every Cu2+ ion replaces
two Cu+ ions, thereby creating holes. As a result, the substance conducts electricity with the
help of these positive holes. Hence, the substance is a p-type semiconductor
Question 1.19:
Ferric oxide crystallises in a hexagonal close-packed array of oxide ions with two out of every
three octahedral holes occupied by ferric ions. Derive the formula of the ferric oxide.
Let the number of oxide (O2−) ions be x.
So, number of octahedral voids = x
It is given that two out of every three octahedral holes are occupied by ferric ions.
So, number of ferric (Fe3+) ions
Therefore, ratio of the number of Fe3+ ions to the number of O2− ions,
Fe3+ : O2−
= 2 : 3
Hence, the formula of the ferric oxide is Fe2O3.

side of the cell?
For a face-centred unit cell:
It is given that the atomic radius, r = 0.144 nm
= 0.407 nm
Hence, length of a side of the cell = 0.407 nm
Question 1.22:
In terms of band theory, what is the difference
(i) Between a conductor and an insulator
(ii) Between a conductor and a semiconductor
(i) The valence band of a conductor is partially-filled or it overlaps with a higher energy,
unoccupied conduction band.
On the other hand, in the case of an insulator, the valence band is fully- filled and there is a
large gap between the valence band and the conduction band.

PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(ii) In the case of a conductor, the valence band is partially-filled or it overlaps with a higher
energy, unoccupied conduction band. So, the electrons can flow easily under an applied
electric field.
On the other hand, the valence band of a semiconductor is filled and there is a small gap
between the valence band and the next higher conduction band. Therefore, some electrons
can jump from the valence band to the conduction band and conduct electricity.
Question 1.23:
Explain the following terms with suitable examples:
(i) Schottky defect
(ii) Frenkel defect
(iii) Interstitials and
(iv) F-centres
(i) Schottky defect: Schottky defect is basically a vacancy defect shown by ionic solids. In
this defect, an equal number of cations and anions are missing to maintain electrical
neutrality. It decreases the density of a substance. Significant number of Schottky defects is
present in ionic solids. For example, in NaCl, there are approximately 106 Schottky pairs per
cm3 at room temperature. Ionic substances containing similar-sized cations and anions show
this type of defect. For example: NaCl, KCl, CsCl, AgBr, etc.
SOLID STATE : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(ii) Frenkel defect: Ionic solids containing large differences in the sizes of ions show this
type of defect. When the smaller ion (usually cation) is dislocated from its normal site to an
interstitial site, Frenkel defect is created. It creates a vacancy defect as well as an interstitial
defect. Frenkel defect is also known as dislocation defect. Ionic solids such as AgCl, AgBr, AgI,
and ZnS show this type of defect.
(iii) Interstitials: Interstitial defect is shown by non-ionic solids. This type of defect is
created when some constituent particles (atoms or molecules) occupy an interstitial site of the
crystal. The density of a substance increases because of this defect.
(iv) F-centres: When the anionic sites of a crystal are occupied by unpaired electrons, the
ionic sites are called F-centres. These unpaired electrons impart colour to the crystals. For
example, when crystals of NaCl are heated in an atmosphere of sodium vapour, the sodium
atoms are deposited on the surface of the crystal. The Cl ions diffuse from the crystal to its
surface and combine with Na atoms, forming NaCl. During this process, the Na atoms on the
surface of the crystal lose electrons. These released electrons diffuse into the crystal and
occupy the vacant anionic sites, creating F-centres.
Question 1.24:
Aluminium crystallises in a cubic close-packed structure. Its metallic radius is 125 pm.
(i) What is the length of the side of the unit cell?

(ii) How many unit cells are there in 1.00 cm3 of aluminium?
(i) For cubic close-packed structure:

= 354 pm (approximately)
(ii) Volume of one unit cell = (354 pm)3
= 4.4 × 107 pm3
= 4.4 × 107 × 10−30 cm3
= 4.4 × 10−23 cm3
Therefore, number of unit cells in 1.00 cm3 =
= 2.27 × 1022
Question 1.25:
If NaCl is doped with 10−3 mol % of SrCl2, what is the concentration of cation vacancies?
It is given that NaCl is doped with 10−3 mol% of SrCl2.
This means that 100 mol of NaCl is doped with 10−3 mol of SrCl2.
Therefore, 1 mol of NaCl is doped with
mol of SrCl2
= 10−5 mol of SrCl2
Cation vacancies produced by one Sr2+ ion = 1
Hence, the concentration of cation vacancies created by SrCl2 is 6.022 × 108 per mol of NaCl.

Question 1.26:
Explain the following with suitable examples:
(i) Ferromagnetism
(ii)Paramagnetism
(iii)Ferrimagnetism
(iv)Antiferromagnetism
(v)12-16 and 13-15 group compounds.
(i) Ferromagnetism: The substances that are strongly attracted by a magnetic field are
called ferromagnetic substances. Ferromagnetic substances can be permanently magnetised
even in the absence of a magnetic field. Some examples of ferromagnetic substances are iron,
cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and CrO2.
In solid state, the metal ions of ferromagnetic substances are grouped together into small
regions called domains and each domain acts as a tiny magnet. In an un-magnetised piece of
a ferromagnetic substance, the domains are randomly-oriented and so, their magnetic
moments get cancelled. However, when the substance is placed in a magnetic field, all the
domains get oriented in the direction of the magnetic field. As a result, a strong magnetic
effect is produced. This ordering of domains persists even after the removal of the magnetic
field. Thus, the ferromagnetic substance becomes a permanent magnet.
Schematic alignment of magnetic moments in ferromagnetic substances
(ii) Paramagnetism: The substances that are attracted by a magnetic field are called
paramagnetic substances. Some examples of paramagnetic substances are O2, Cu2t, Fe3t, and
Cr3t.
Paramagnetic substances get magnetised in a magnetic field in the same direction, but lose
magnetism when the magnetic field is removed. To undergo paramagnetism, a substance
must have one or more unpaired electrons. This is because the unpaired electrons are
attracted by a magnetic field, thereby causing paramagnetism.
(iii) Ferrimagnetism: The substances in which the magnetic moments of the domains are
aligned in parallel and anti-parallel directions, in unequal numbers, are said to have
ferrimagnetism. Examples include Fe3O4 (magnetite), ferrites such as MgFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4.
Ferrimagnetic substances are weakly attracted by a magnetic field as compared to
ferromagnetic substances. On heating, these substances become paramagnetic.

(iv) Antiferromagnetism: Antiferromagnetic substanceshave domain structures similar to
ferromagnetic substances, but are oppositely-oriented. The oppositely-oriented domains
cancel out each other’s magnetic moments.
Schematic alignment of magnetic moments in antiferromagnetic substances
(v) 12-16 and 13-15 group compounds: The 12-16 group compounds are prepared by
combining group 12 and group 16 elements and the 13-15 group compounds are prepared by
combining group 13 and group15 elements. These compounds are prepared to stimulate
average valence of four as in Ge or Si. Indium (III) antimonide (IrSb), aluminium phosphide
(AlP), and gallium arsenide (GaAS) are typical compounds of groups 13-15. GaAs
semiconductors have a very fast response time and have revolutionised the designing of
semiconductor devices. Examples of group 12-16 compounds include zinc sulphide (ZnS),
cadmium sulphide (CdS), cadmium selenide (CdSe), and mercury (II) telluride (HgTe). The
bonds in these compounds are not perfectly covalent. The ionic character of the bonds
depends on the electronegativities of the two elements.

HCl reacts with Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 according to the following equation.
1 mol of Na2CO3 reacts with 2 mol of HCl.
Therefore, 0.0053 mol of Na2CO3 reacts with 2 × 0.0053 mol = 0.0106 mol.
Similarly, 1 mol of NaHCO3 reacts with 1 mol of HCl.
Therefore, 0.0053 mol of NaHCO3 reacts with 0.0053 mol of HCl.
Total moles of HCl required = (0.0106 + 0.0053) mol

Question 2.10:
What role does the molecular interaction play in a solution of alcohol and water?
In pure alcohol and water, the molecules are held tightly by a strong hydrogen bonding. The
interaction between the molecules of alcohol and water is weaker than alcohol−alcohol and
water−water interactions. As a result, when alcohol and water are mixed, the intermolecular
interactions become weaker and the molecules can easily escape. This increases the vapour
pressure of the solution, which in turn lowers the boiling point of the resulting solution.
Question 2.11:
Why do gases always tend to be less soluble in liquids as the temperature is raised?
Solubility of gases in liquids decreases with an increase in temperature. This is because
dissolution of gases in liquids is an exothermic process.
Therefore, when the temperature is increased, heat is supplied and the equilibrium shifts
backwards, thereby decreasing the solubility of gases.
Question 2.12:
State Henry’s law and mention some important applications?
Henry’s law states that partial pressure of a gas in the vapour phase is proportional
to the mole fraction of the gas in the solution. If p is the partial pressure of the gas in the
vapour phase and x is the mole fraction of the gas, then Henry’s law can be expressed as:
p = KH x
Where,
KH is Henry’s law constant
Some important applications of Henry’s law are mentioned below.
(i) Bottles are sealed under high pressure to increase the solubility of CO2 in soft drinks and
soda water.
(ii) Henry’s law states that the solubility of gases increases with an increase in pressure.
Therefore, when a scuba diver dives deep into the sea, the increased sea pressure causes the

back to the surface, the solubility of nitrogen again decreases and the dissolved gas is
released, leading to the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood. This results in the
blockage of capillaries and leads to a medical condition known as ‘bends’ or ‘decompression
sickness’.
Hence, the oxygen tanks used by scuba divers are filled with air and diluted with helium to
avoid bends.
(iii) The concentration of oxygen is low in the blood and tissues of people living at high
altitudes such as climbers. This is because at high altitudes, partial pressure of oxygen is less
than that at ground level. Low-blood oxygen causes climbers to become weak and disables
them from thinking clearly. These are symptoms of anoxia.
Question 2.13:

Question 2.14:
What is meant by positive and negative deviations from Raoult's law and how is the sign of
ΔsolH related to positive and negative deviations from Raoult's law?
According to Raoult’s law, the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in any
solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. The solutions which obey Raoult’s law over
the entire range of concentration are known as ideal solutions. The solutions that do not obey
Raoult’s law (non-ideal solutions) have vapour pressures either higher or lower than that
predicted by Raoult’s law. If the vapour pressure is higher, then the solution is said to exhibit
positive deviation, and if it is lower, then the solution is said to exhibit negative deviation from
Raoult’s law.

Here, ΔTf = (273.15 − 271) K
= 2.15 K
Molar mass of sugar (C12H22O11) = 12 × 12 + 22 × 1 + 11 × 16
= 342 g mol−1
5% solution (by mass) of cane sugar in water means 5 g of cane sugar is present in (100 −
5)g = 95 g of water.
SOLUTION : NCERT QUESTION ANSWER
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Now, number of moles of cane sugar
= 0.0146 mol
Therefore, molality of the solution,
= 0.1537 mol kg−1
Applying the relation,
ΔTf = Kf × m
= 13.99 K kg mol−1
Molar of glucose (C6H12O6) = 6 × 12 + 12 × 1 + 6 × 16
= 180 g mol−1
5% glucose in water means 5 g of glucose is present in (100 − 5) g = 95 g of water.
Number of moles of glucose
= 0.0278 mol
Therefore, molality of the solution,
= 0.2926 mol kg−1
Applying the relation,
ΔTf = Kf × m
= 13.99 K kg mol−1 × 0.2926 mol kg−1
= 4.09 K (approximately)

Let the atomic masses of A and B be x and y respectively.
Now, we can write:
Subtracting equation (i) from (ii), we have

Define conductivity and molar conductivity for the solution of an electrolyte. Discuss their
variation with concentration.
Conductivity of a solution is defined as the conductance of a solution of 1 cm in length and
area of cross-section 1 sq. cm. The inverse of resistivity is called conductivity or specific
conductance. It is represented by the symbolκ. If ρ is resistivity, then we can write:
The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance (G) of one unit
volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with the unit area of cross-section
and at a distance of unit length.
i.e.,
(Since a = 1, l = 1)
Conductivity always decreases with a decrease in concentration, both for weak and strong
electrolytes. This is because the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in a
solution decreases with a decrease in concentration.
Molar conductivity:
Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of volume V of a
solution containing 1 mole of the electrolyte kept between two electrodes with the area of
cross-section A and distance of unit length.
Now, l = 1 and A = V (volume containing 1 mole of the electrolyte).
Molar conductivity increases with a decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume
V of the solution containing one mole of the electrolyte increases on dilution.

Question 5.1:
Write any two characteristics of Chemisorption
1. Chemisorption is highly specific in nature. It occurs only if there is a possibility of chemical
bonding between the adsorbent and the adsorbate.
2. Like physisorption, chemisorption also increases with an increase in the surface area of the
adsorbent.
Question 5.2:
Why does physisorption decrease with the increase of temperature?
Physisorption is exothermic in nature. Therefore, in accordance with Le-Chateliere’s principle,
it decreases with an increase in temperature. This means that physisorption occurs more
readily at a lower temperature.
Question 5.3:
Why are powdered substances more effective adsorbents than their crystalline forms?
Powdered substances are more effective adsorbents than their crystalline forms because when
a substance is powdered, its surface area increases and physisorption is directly proportional
to the surface area of the adsorbent.
Question 5.4:
Why is it necessary to remove CO when ammonia is obtained by Haber’s process?
It is important to remove CO in the synthesis of ammonia as CO adversely affects the activity
of the iron catalyst, used in Haber’s process.
Question 5.5:
Why is the ester hydrolysis slow in the beginning and becomes faster after sometime?
Ester hydrolysis can be represented as:
The acid produced in the reaction acts as a catalyst and makes the reaction faster. Substances
that act as catalysts in the same reaction in which they are obtained as products are known as
autocatalysts
Question 5.6:
What is the role of desorption in the process of catalysis?
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
The role of desorption in the process of catalysis is to make the surface of the solid catalyst
free for the fresh adsorption of the reactants on the surface.
Question 5.7:
What modification can you suggest in the Hardy-Schulze law?
Hardy-Schulze law states that ‘the greater the valence of the flocculating ion added, the
greater is its power to cause precipitation.’
This law takes into consideration only the charge carried by an ion, not its size. The smaller
the size of an ion, the more will be its polarising power. Thus, Hardy-Schulze law can be
modified in terms of the polarising power of the flocculating ion. Thus, the modified Hardy-
Schulze law can be stated as ‘the greater the polarising power of the flocculating ion added,
the greater is its power to cause precipitation
Question 5.8:
Why is it essential to wash the precipitate with water before estimating it
quantitatively?
When a substance gets precipitated, some ions that combine to form the precipitate get
adsorbed on the surface of the precipitate. Therefore, it becomes important to wash the
precipitate before estimating it quantitatively in order to remove these adsorbed ions or other
such impurities
Question 5.1:
Distinguish between the meaning of the terms adsorption and absorption.
Give one example of each.
Adsorption is a surface phenomenon of accumulation of molecules of a substance at the
surface rather than in the bulk of a solid or liquid. The substance that gets adsorbed is called
the ‘adsorbate’ and the substance on whose surface the adsorption takes place is called the
‘adsorbent’. Here, the concentration of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent
increases. In adsorption, the substance gets concentrated at the surface only. It does not
penetrate through the surface to the bulk of the solid or liquid. For example, when we dip a
chalk stick into an ink solution, only its surface becomes coloured. If we break the chalk stick,
it will be found to be white from inside.
On the other hand, the process of absorption is a bulk phenomenon. In absorption, the
substance gets uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the solid or liquid.

Question 5.3:
Give reason why a finely divided substance is more effective as an adsorbent.
Adsorption is a surface phenomenon. Therefore, adsorption is directly proportional to the
surface area. A finely divided substance has a large surface area. Both physisorption and
chemisorption increase with an increase in the surface area. Hence, a finely divided substance
behaves as a good adsorbent
Question 5.4:
What are the factors which influence the adsorption of a gas on a solid?
There are various factors that affect the rate of adsorption of a gas on a solid surface.
(1) Nature of the gas:
Easily liquefiable gases such as NH3, HCl etc. are adsorbed to a great extent in comparison to
gases such as H2, O2 etc. This is because Van der Waal’s forces are stronger in easily
liquefiable gases.
(2) Surface area of the solid
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
The greater the surface area of the adsorbent, the greater is the adsorption of a gas on the
solid surface.
(3) Effect of pressure
Adsorption is a reversible process and is accompanied by a decrease in pressure. Therefore,
adsorption increases with an increase in pressure.
(4) Effect of temperature
Adsorption is an exothermic process. Thus, in accordance with Le-Chatelier’s principle, the
magnitude of adsorption decreases with an increase in temperature
Question 5.5:
What is an adsorption isotherm? Describe Freundlich adsorption isotherm.
The plot between the extent of adsorption
against the pressure of gas (P) at constant
temperature (T) is called the adsorption isotherm.
Freundlich adsorption isotherm:
Freundlich adsorption isotherm gives an empirical relationship between the quantity of gas
adsorbed by the unit mass of solid adsorbent and pressure at a specific temperature.
From the given plot it is clear that at pressure PS,
reaches the maximum valve. Ps is called
the saturation pressure. Three cases arise from the graph now.
Case I- At low pressure:
The plot is straight and sloping, indicating that the pressure in directly proportional to
i.e.,

Case II- At high pressure:
When pressure exceeds the saturated pressure,
becomes independent of P values.
Case III- At intermediate pressure:
At intermediate pressure,
depends on P raised to the powers between 0 and 1. This
relationship is known as the Freundlich adsorption isotherm.
On plotting the graph between log
and log P, a straight line is obtained with the slope
equal to

Question 5.6:
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
What do you understand by activation of adsorbent? How is it achieved?
By activating an adsorbent, we tend to increase the adsorbing power of the adsorbent. Some
ways to activate an adsorbent are:
(i) By increasing the surface area of the adsorbent. This can be done by breaking it into
smaller pieces or powdering it.
(ii) Some specific treatments can also lead to the activation of the adsorbent. For example,
wood charcoal is activated by heating it between 650 K and 1330 K in vacuum or air. It expels
all the gases absorbed or adsorbed and thus, creates a space for adsorption of gases
Question 5.7:
What role does adsorption play in heterogeneous catalysis?
Heterogeneous catalysis:
A catalytic process in which the catalyst and the reactants are present in different phases is
known as a heterogeneous catalysis. This heterogeneous catalytic action can be explained in
terms of the adsorption theory. The mechanism of catalysis involves the following steps:
(i) Adsorption of reactant molecules on the catalyst surface.
(ii) Occurrence of a chemical reaction through the formation of an intermediate.
(iii) De-sorption of products from the catalyst surface
(iv) Diffusion of products away from the catalyst surface.
In this process, the reactants are usually present in the gaseous state and the catalyst is
present in the solid state. Gaseous molecules are then adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.
As the concentration of reactants on the surface of the catalyst increases, the rate of reaction
also increases. In such reactions, the products have very less affinity for the catalyst and are
quickly desorbed, thereby making the surface free for other reactants
Question 5.8:
Why is adsorption always exothermic?
Adsorption is always exothermic. This statement can be explained in two ways.
(i) Adsorption leads to a decrease in the residual forces on the surface of the adsorbent. This
causes a decrease in the surface energy of the adsorbent. Therefore, adsorption is always
exothermic.
(ii) ΔH of adsorption is always negative. When a gas is adsorbed on a solid surface, its
movement is restricted leading to a decrease in the entropy of the gas i.e., ΔS is negative.
Now for a process to be spontaneous, ΔG should be negative.
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION

Since ΔS is negative, ΔH has to be negative to make ΔG negative. Hence, adsorption is always
exothermic
Question 5.9:
How are the colloidal solutions classified on the basis of physical states of the
dispersed phase and dispersion medium?
One criterion for classifying colloids is the physical state of the dispersed phase and dispersion
medium. Depending upon the type of the dispersed phase and dispersion medium (solid,
liquid, or gas), there can be eight types of colloidal systems.

Question 5.10:
Discuss the effect of pressure and temperature on the adsorption of gases on solids.
Effect of pressure
Adsorption is a reversible process and is accompanied by a decrease in pressure. Therefore,
adsorption increases with an increase in pressure.
Effect of temperature
Adsorption is an exothermic process. Thus, in accordance with Le-Chatelier’s principle, the
magnitude of adsorption decreases with an increase in temperature
Question 5.11:
What are lyophilic and lyophobic sols? Give one example of each type. Why are
hydrophobic sols easily coagulated?
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(i) Lyophilic sols:
Colloidal sols that are formed by mixing substances such as gum, gelatin, starch, etc. with a
suitable liquid (dispersion medium) are called lyophilic sols. These sols are reversible in nature
i.e., if two constituents of the sol are separated by any means (such as evaporation), then the
sol can be prepared again by simply mixing the dispersion medium with the dispersion phase
and shaking the mixture.
(ii) Lyophobic sols:
When substances such as metals and their sulphides etc. are mixed with the dispersion
medium, they do not form colloidal sols. Their colloidal sols can be prepared only by special
methods. Such sols are called lyophobic sols. These sols are irreversible in nature. For
example: sols of metals.
Now, the stability of hydrophilic sols depends on two things- the presence of a charge and the
salvation of colloidal particles. On the other hand, the stability of hydrophobic sols is only
because of the presence of a charge. Therefore, the latter are much less stable than the
former. If the charge of hydrophobic sols is removed (by addition of electrolytes), then the
particles present in them come closer and form aggregates, leading to precipitation
Question 5.12:
What is the difference between multimolecular and macromolecular colloids? Give one
example of each. How are associated colloids different from these two types of colloids?
(i) In multi-molecular colloids, the colloidal particles are an aggregate of atoms or small
molecules with a diameter of less than 1 nm. The molecules in the aggregate are held
together by van der Waal’s forces of attraction. Examples of such colloids include gold sol and
sulphur sol.
(ii) In macro-molecular colloids, the colloidal particles are large molecules having colloidal
dimensions. These particles have a high molecular mass. When these particles are dissolved in
a liquid, sol is obtained. For example: starch, nylon, cellulose, etc.
(iii) Certain substances tend to behave like normal electrolytes at lower concentrations.
However, at higher concentrations, these substances behave as colloidal solutions due to the
formation of aggregated particles. Such colloids are called aggregated colloids
Question 5.13:
What are enzymes? Write in brief the mechanism of enzyme catalysis.
Enzymes are basically protein molecules of high molecular masses. These form colloidal
solutions when dissolved in water. These are complex, nitrogenous organic compounds
produced by living plants and animals. Enzymes are also called ‘biochemical catalysts’.
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Mechanism of enzyme catalysis:
On the surface of the enzymes, various cavities are present with characteristic shapes. These
cavities possess active groups such as −NH2, −COOH, etc. The reactant molecules having a
complementary shape fit into the cavities just like a key fits into a lock. This leads to the
formation of an activated complex. This complex then decomposes to give the product.
Hence,
Step 1: E + S → ES+
(Activated complex)
Step 2: ES+ → E + P
Question 5.14:
How are colloids classified on the basis of
(i) Physical states of components
(ii) Nature of dispersion medium and
(iii) Interaction between dispersed phase and dispersion medium?
Colloids can be classified on various bases:
(i) On the basis of the physical state of the components (by components we mean the
dispersed phase and dispersion medium). Depending on whether the components are solids,
liquids, or gases, we can have eight types of colloids.
(ii) On the basis of the dispersion medium, sols can be divided as:
Dispersion medium
Name of sol
Water
Aquasol or hydrosol
Alcohol
Alcosol

(iii) On the basis of the nature of the interaction between the dispersed phase and dispersion
medium, the colloids can be classified as lyophilic (solvent attracting) and lyophobic (solvent
repelling).
Question 5.15:
Explain what is observed
(i) When a beam of light is passed through a colloidal sol.
(ii) An electrolyte, NaCl is added to hydrated ferric oxide sol.
(iii) Electric current is passed through a colloidal sol?
(i) When a beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution, then scattering of light is
observed. This is known as the Tyndall effect. This scattering of light illuminates the path of
the beam in the colloidal solution.
(ii) When NaCl is added to ferric oxide sol, it dissociates to give Na+ and Cl- ions. Particles of
ferric oxide sol are positively charged. Thus, they get coagulated in the presence of negatively
charged Cl- ions.
(iii) The colloidal particles are charged and carry either a positive or negative charge. The
dispersion medium carries an equal and opposite charge. This makes the whole system
neutral. Under the influence of an electric current, the colloidal particles move towards the
oppositely charged electrode. When they come in contact with the electrode, they lose their
charge and coagulate
Question 5.16:
What are emulsions? What are their different types? Give example of each type.
The colloidal solution in which both the dispersed phase and dispersion medium are liquids is
called an emulsion.
There are two types of emulsions:
(a) Oil in water type:
Here, oil is the dispersed phase while water is the dispersion medium. For example: milk,
vanishing cream, etc.
(b) Water in oil type:
Here, water is the dispersed phase while oil is the dispersion medium. For example: cold
cream, butter, etc

Question 5.17:
What is demulsification? Name two demulsifiers.
The process of decomposition of an emulsion into its constituent liquids is called
demulsification. Examples of demulsifiers are surfactants, ethylene oxide, etc
Question 5.18:
Action of soap is due to emulsification and micelle formation. Comment.
The cleansing action of soap is due to emulsification and micelle formation. Soaps are basically
sodium and potassium salts of long chain fatty acids, R-COO-Na+. The end of the molecule to
which the sodium is attached is polar in nature, while the alkyl-end is non-polar. Thus, a soap
molecule contains a hydrophilic (polar) and a hydrophobic (non-polar) part.
When soap is added to water containing dirt, the soap molecules surround the dirt particles in
such a manner that their hydrophobic parts get attached to the dirt molecule and the
hydrophilic parts point away from the dirt molecule. This is known as micelle formation. Thus,
we can say that the polar group dissolves in water while the non-polar group dissolves in the
dirt particle. Now, as these micelles are negatively charged, they do not coalesce and a stable
emulsion is formed
Question 5.19:
Give four examples of heterogeneous catalysis.
(i) Oxidation of sulphur dioxide to form sulphur trioxide. In this reaction, Pt acts as a catalyst.
(ii) Formation of ammonia by the combination of dinitrogen and dihydrogen in the presence of
finely divided iron.
This process is called the Haber’s process.
(iii) Oswald’s process: Oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide in the presence of platinum.
(iv) Hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the presence of Ni.
Question 5.20:
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
What do you mean by activity and selectivity of catalysts?
(a) Activity of a catalyst:
The activity of a catalyst is its ability to increase the rate of a particular reaction.
Chemisorption is the main factor in deciding the activity of a catalyst. The adsorption of
reactants on the catalyst surface should be neither too strong nor too weak. It should just be
strong enough to make the catalyst active.
(b) Selectivity of the catalyst:
The ability of the catalyst to direct a reaction to yield a particular product is referred to as the
selectivity of the catalyst. For example, by using different catalysts, we can get different
products for the reaction between H2 and CO.
(iii)
Question 5.21:
Describe some features of catalysis by zeolites.
Zeolites are alumino-silicates that are micro-porous in nature. Zeolites have a honeycomb-like
structure, which makes them shape-selective catalysts. They have an extended 3D-network of
silicates in which some silicon atoms are replaced by aluminium atoms, giving them an
Al−O−Si framework. The reactions taking place in zeolites are very sensitive to the pores and
cavity size of the zeolites. Zeolites are commonly used in the petrochemical industry.
Question 5.22:
What is shape selective catalysis?
A catalytic reaction which depends upon the pore structure of the catalyst and on the size of
the reactant and the product molecules is called shape-selective catalysis. For example,
catalysis by zeolites is a shape-selective catalysis. The pore size present in the zeolites ranges
from 260-740 pm. Thus, molecules having a pore size more than this cannot enter the zeolite
and undergo the reaction
Question 5.23:
Explain the following terms:
(i) Electrophoresis (ii) Coagulation
(iii) Dialysis (iv) Tyndall effect.
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(i) Electrophoresis:
The movement of colloidal particles under the influence of an applied electric field is known as
electrophoresis. Positively charged particles move to the cathode, while negatively charged
particles move towards the anode. As the particles reach oppositely charged electrodes, they
become neutral and get coagulated.
(ii) Coagulation:
The process of settling down of colloidal particles i.e., conversion of a colloid into a precipitate
is called coagulation.
(iii) Dialysis
The process of removing a dissolved substance from a colloidal solution by the means of
diffusion through a membrane is known as dialysis. This process is based on the principle that
ions and small molecules can pass through animal membranes unlike colloidal particles.
(iv) Tyndall effect:
When a beam of light is allowed to pass through a colloidal solution, it becomes visible like a
column of light. This is known as the Tyndall effect. This phenomenon takes place as particles
of colloidal dimensions scatter light in all directions
Question 5.24:
Give four uses of emulsions.
Four uses of emulsions:
(i) Cleansing action of soaps is based on the formation of emulsions.
(ii) Digestion of fats in intestines takes place by the process of emulsification.
(iii) Antiseptics and disinfectants when added to water form emulsions.
(iv) The process of emulsification is used to make medicines
Question 5.25:
What are micelles? Give an example of a micellers system.
Micelle formation is done by substances such as soaps and detergents when dissolved in
water. The molecules of such substances contain a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. When
present in water, these substances arrange themselves in spherical structures in such a
manner that their hydrophobic parts are present towards the centre, while the hydrophilic
parts are pointing towards the outside (as shown in the given figure). This is known as micelle
formation.

dispersed phase is called an alcosol.
For example: colloidal sol of cellulose nitrate in ethyl alcohol is an alcosol.
(ii) Aerosol:
A colloidal solution having a gas as the dispersion medium and a solid as the dispersed phase
is called an aerosol.
For example: fog
(iii) Hydrosol
A colloidal solution having water as the dispersion medium and a solid as the dispersed phase
is called a hydrosol.
For example: starch sol or gold sol
Question 5.27:
Comment on the statement that “colloid is not a substance but a state of substance”.
Common salt (a typical crystalloid in an aqueous medium) behaves as a colloid in a benzene
medium. Hence, we can say that a colloidal substance does not represent a separate class of
substances. When the size of the solute particle lies between 1 nm and 1000 nm, it behaves
as a colloid.
SURFACE CHEMISTRY:  NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Hence, we can say that colloid is not a substance but a state of the substance which is
dependent on the size of the particle. A colloidal state is intermediate between a true solution
and a suspension

hydrogen electrode, represented by Pt(s), H2(g) (1 atm) | H+
(aq)(1 M).
A cell, consisting of Mg | MgSO4 (aq 1 M) as the anode and the standard hydrogen electrode

Question 3.2:
Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot?
Zinc is more reactive than copper. Therefore, zinc can displace copper from its salt solution. If
copper sulphate solution is stored in a zinc pot, then zinc will displace copper from the copper
sulphate solution.
Hence, copper sulphate solution cannot be stored in a zinc pot.

Define conductivity and molar conductivity for the solution of an electrolyte. Discuss their
variation with concentration.
Conductivity of a solution is defined as the conductance of a solution of 1 cm in length and
area of cross-section 1 sq. cm. The inverse of resistivity is called conductivity or specific
conductance. It is represented by the symbolκ. If ρ is resistivity, then we can write:
The conductivity of a solution at any given concentration is the conductance (G) of one unit
volume of solution kept between two platinum electrodes with the unit area of cross-section
and at a distance of unit length.
i.e.,
(Since a = 1, l = 1)
Conductivity always decreases with a decrease in concentration, both for weak and strong
electrolytes. This is because the number of ions per unit volume that carry the current in a
solution decreases with a decrease in concentration.
Molar conductivity:
Molar conductivity of a solution at a given concentration is the conductance of volume V of a
solution containing 1 mole of the electrolyte kept between two electrodes with the area of
cross-section A and distance of unit length.
Now, l = 1 and A = V (volume containing 1 mole of the electrolyte).
Molar conductivity increases with a decrease in concentration. This is because the total volume
V of the solution containing one mole of the electrolyte increases on dilution.

Question 7.1:
Why are pentahalides more covalent than trihalides?
Answer
In pentahalides, the oxidation state is +5 and in trihalides, the oxidation state is +3. Since the
metal ion with a high charge has more polarizing power, pentahalides are more covalent than
trihalides
Question 7.2:
Why is BiH3 the strongest reducing agent amongst all the hydrides of
Group 15 elements?
Answer
As we move down a group, the atomic size increases and the stability of the hydrides of group
15 elements decreases. Since the stability of hydrides decreases on moving from NH3 to BiH3,
the reducing character of the hydrides increases on moving from NH3 to BiH3
Question 7.3:
Why is N2 less reactive at room temperature?

From the structure of N2O5, it is evident that the covalence of nitrogen is 4
Question 7.7:
Bond angle in
is higher than that in PH3. Why?
Answer
In PH3, P is sp3 hybridized. Three orbitals are involved in bonding with three hydrogen atoms
and the fourth one contains a lone pair. As lone pair-bond pair repulsion is stronger than bond
pair-bond pair repulsion, the tetrahedral shape associated with sp3 bonding is changed to
pyramidal. PH3 combines with a proton to form
in which the lone pair is absent. Due to
the absence of lone pair in
, there is no lone pair-bond pair repulsion. Hence, the bond
angle in

PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Why is H2O a liquid and H2S a gas?
Answer
H2O has oxygen as the central atom. Oxygen has smaller size and higher electronegativity as
compared to sulphur. Therefore, there is extensive hydrogen bonding in H2O, which is absent

Why does O3 act as a powerful oxidising agent?
Answer
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Ozone is not a very stable compound under normal conditions and decomposes readily on
heating to give a molecule of oxygen and nascent oxygen. Nascent oxygen, being a free
radical, is very reactive.
Therefore, ozone acts as a powerful oxidising agent.
Question 7.19:
How is O3 estimated quantitatively?
Answer
Quantitatively, ozone can be estimated with the help of potassium iodide. When ozone is made
to react with potassium iodide solution buffered with a borate buffer (pH 9.2), iodine is
liberated. This liberated iodine can be titrated against a standard solution of sodium
thiosulphate using starch as an indicator. The reactions involved in the process are given

P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
During the formation of SO2, one electron from 3p orbital goes to the 3d orbital and S
undergoes sp2 hybridization. Two of these orbitals form sigma bonds with two oxygen atoms
and the third contains a lone pair. p-orbital and d-orbital contain an unpaired electron each.
One of these electrons forms pπ- pπ bond with one oxygen atom and the other forms pπ- dπ
bond with the other oxygen. This is the reason SO2 has a bent structure. Also, it is a
resonance hybrid of structures I and II.
Both S−O bonds are equal in length (143 pm) and have a multiple bond character
Question 7.22:
How is the presence of SO2 detected?

Answer Question 7.25:
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Why is
for H2SO4 in water?
Answer
It can be noticed that
This is because a neutral H2SO4 has a much higher tendency to lose a proton than the
negatively charged
. Thus, the former is a much stronger acid than the latter
Manufacture of sulphuric acid by Contact process involves three steps.
1. Burning of ores to form SO2
2. Conversion of SO2 to SO3 by the reaction of the former with O2
(V2O5 is used in this process as a catalyst.)
3. Absorption of SO3 in H2SO4 to give oleum (H2S2O7)
The key step in this process is the second step. In this step, two moles of gaseous reactants
combine to give one mole of gaseous product. Also, this reaction is exothermic. Thus, in
accordance with Le Chatelier’s principle, to obtain the maximum amount of SO3 gas,
temperature should be low and pressure should be high
Question 7.26:
Considering the parameters such as bond dissociation enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and
hydration enthalpy, compare the oxidising power of F2 and Cl2.

1. Bond dissociation energy
2. Electron gain enthalpy
3. Hydration enthalpy
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
The electron gain enthalpy of chlorine is more negative than that of fluorine. However, the
bond dissociation energy of fluorine is much lesser than that of chlorine. Also, because of its
small size, the hydration energy of fluorine is much higher than that of chlorine. Therefore, the
latter two factors more than compensate for the less negative electron gain enthalpy of
fluorine. Thus, fluorine is a much stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine

carnallite, KCl.MgCl2.6H2O. Marine life also contains iodine in their systems. For example, sea
weeds contain upto 0.5% iodine as sodium iodide. Thus, sea is the greatest source of halogens
Question 7.29:

Why is ICl more reactive than I2?
Answer
ICl is more reactive than I2 because I−Cl bond in ICl is weaker than I−I bond in I2
Question 7.32:
Why is helium used in diving apparatus?
Answer
Air contains a large amount of nitrogen and the solubility of gases in liquids increases with
increase in pressure. When sea divers dive deep into the sea, large amount of nitrogen
dissolves in their blood. When they come back to the surface, solubility of nitrogen decreases
and it separates from the blood and forms small air bubbles. This leads to a dangerous
medical condition called bends. Therefore, air in oxygen cylinders used for diving is diluted
with helium gas. This is done as He is sparingly less soluble in blood

Discuss the general characteristics of Group 15 elements with reference to their electronic
configuration, oxidation state, atomic size, ionisation enthalpy and electronegativity.
Answer
General trends in group 15 elements
(i) Electronic configuration: All the elements in group 15 have 5 valence electrons. Their
general electronic configuration is ns2 np3.
(ii) Oxidation states: All these elements have 5 valence electrons and require three more
electrons to complete their octets. However, gaining electrons is very difficult as the nucleus
will have to attract three more electrons. This can take place only with nitrogen as it is the
smallest in size and the distance between the nucleus and the valence shell is relatively small.
The remaining elements of this group show a formal oxidation state of −3 in their covalent
compounds. In addition to the −3 state, N and P also show −1 and −2 oxidation states.
All the elements present in this group show +3 and +5 oxidation states. However, the stability
of +5 oxidation state decreases down a group, whereas the stability of +3 oxidation state
increases. This happens because of the inert pair effect.
(iii) Ionization energy and electronegativity
First ionization decreases on moving down a group. This is because of increasing atomic sizes.
As we move down a group, electronegativity decreases, owing to an increase in size.
(iv) Atomic size: On moving down a group, the atomic size increases. This increase in the
atomic size is attributed to an increase in the number of shells
Question 7.2:
Why does the reactivity of nitrogen differ from phosphorus?
Answer
Nitrogen is chemically less reactive. This is because of the high stability of its molecule, N2. In
N2, the two nitrogen atoms form a triple bond. This triple bond has very high bond strength,
which is very difficult to break. It is because of nitrogen’s small size that it is able to form
pπ−pπ bonds with itself. This property is not exhibited by atoms such as phosphorus. Thus,
phosphorus is more reactive than nitrogen

(i) Reactivity towards hydrogen:
The elements of group 15 react with hydrogen to form hydrides of type EH3, where E = N, P,
As, Sb, or Bi. The stability of hydrides decreases on moving down from NH3 to BiH3.
(ii) Reactivity towards oxygen:
The elements of group 15 form two types of oxides: E2O3 and E2O5, where E = N, P, As, Sb, or
Bi. The oxide with the element in the higher oxidation state is more acidic than the other.
However, the acidic character decreases on moving down a group.
(iii) Reactivity towards halogens:
The group 15 elements react with halogens to form two series of salts: EX3 and EX5. However,
nitrogen does not form NX5 as it lacks the d-orbital. All trihalides (except NX3) are stable.
(iv) Reactivity towards metals:
The group 15 elements react with metals to form binary compounds in which metals exhibit
−3 oxidation states
Question 7.4:
Why does NH3 form hydrogen bond but PH3 does not?
Answer
Nitrogen is highly electronegative as compared to phosphorus. This causes a greater attraction
of electrons towards nitrogen in NH3 than towards phosphorus in PH3. Hence, the extent of
hydrogen bonding in PH3 is very less as compared to NH3

Question 7.9:
The HNH angle value is higher than HPH, HAsH and HSbH angles. Why? [Hint: Can be
explained on the basis of sp3 hybridisation in NH3 and only s−p bonding between hydrogen
and other elements of the group].
Answer
Hydride NH3 PH3 AsH3 SbH3
H−M−H angle 107° 92° 91° 90°
The above trend in the H−M−H bond angle can be explained on the basis of the
electronegativity of the central atom. Since nitrogen is highly electronegative, there is high
electron density around nitrogen. This causes greater repulsion between the electron pairs
around nitrogen, resulting in maximum bond angle. We know that electronegativity decreases
on moving down a group. Consequently, the repulsive interactions between the electron pairs
decrease, thereby decreasing the H−M−H bond angle
Question 7.10:
Why does R3P=O exist but R3N=O does not (R = alkyl group)?
Answer
N (unlike P) lacks the d-orbital. This restricts nitrogen to expand its coordination number
beyond four. Hence, R3N=O does not exist
Question 7.11:

Answer
NH3 is distinctly basic while BiH3 is feebly basic.
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Nitrogen has a small size due to which the lone pair of electrons is concentrated in a small
region. This means that the charge density per unit volume is high. On moving down a group,
the size of the central atom increases and the charge gets distributed over a large area
decreasing the electron density. Hence, the electron donating capacity of group 15 element
hydrides decreases on moving down the group
Question 7.12:
Nitrogen exists as diatomic molecule and phosphorus as P4. Why?
Answer
Nitrogen owing to its small size has a tendency to form pπ−pπ multiple bonds with itself.
Nitrogen thus forms a very stable diatomic molecule, N2. On moving down a group, the
tendency to form pπ−pπ bonds decreases (because of the large size of heavier elements).
Therefore, phosphorus (like other heavier metals) exists in the P4 state

Question 7.14:
Why does nitrogen show catenation properties less than phosphorus?
Answer
Catenation is much more common in phosphorous compounds than in nitrogen compounds.
This is because of the relative weakness of the N−N single bond as compared to the P−P
single bond. Since nitrogen atom is smaller, there is greater repulsion of electron density of
two nitrogen atoms, thereby weakening the N−N single bond

Can PCl5 act as an oxidising as well as a reducing agent? Justify.
Answer
PCl5 can only act as an oxidizing agent. The highest oxidation state that P can show is +5. In
PCl5, phosphorus is in its highest oxidation state (+5). However, it can decrease its oxidation
state and act as an oxidizing agent
Question 7.17:
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Justify the placement of O, S, Se, Te and Po in the same group of the periodic table in terms
of electronic configuration, oxidation state and hydride formation.
Answer
The elements of group 16 are collectively called chalcogens.
(i) Elements of group 16 have six valence electrons each. The general electronic configuration
of these elements is ns2 np4, where n varies from 2 to 6.
(ii) Oxidation state:
As these elements have six valence electrons (ns2 np4), they should display an oxidation state
of −2. However, only oxygen predominantly shows the oxidation state of −2 owing to its high
electronegativity. It also exhibits the oxidation state of −1 (H2O2), zero (O2), and +2 (OF2).
However, the stability of the −2 oxidation state decreases on moving down a group due to a
decrease in the electronegativity of the elements. The heavier elements of the group show an
oxidation state of +2, +4, and +6 due to the availability of d-orbitals.
(iii) Formation of hydrides:
These elements form hydrides of formula H2E, where E = O, S, Se, Te, PO. Oxygen and
sulphur also form hydrides of type H2E2. These hydrides are quite volatile in nature
Question 7.18:
Why is dioxygen a gas but sulphur a solid?
Answer
Oxygen is smaller in size as compared to sulphur. Due to its smaller size, it can effectively
form pπ−pπ bonds and form O2 (O==O) molecule. Also, the intermolecular forces in oxygen
are weak van der Wall’s, which cause it to exist as gas. On the other hand, sulphur does not
form M2 molecule but exists as a puckered structure held together by strong covalent bonds.
Hence, it is a solid
Question 7.19:
Knowing the electron gain enthalpy values for O → O− and O → O2− as −141
and 702 kJ mol−1 respectively, how can you account for the formation of a
large number of oxides having O2− species and not O−?
(Hint: Consider lattice energy factor in the formation of compounds).
Answer
Stability of an ionic compound depends on its lattice energy. More the lattice energy of a
compound, more stable it will be.
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Lattice energy is directly proportional to the charge carried by an ion. When a metal combines
with oxygen, the lattice energy of the oxide involving O2− ion is much more than the oxide
involving O− ion. Hence, the oxide having O2− ions are more stable than oxides having O−.
Hence, we can say that formation of O2− is energetically more favourable than formation of O−
Question 7.20:
Which aerosols deplete ozone?
Answer
Freons or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are aerosols that accelerate the depletion of ozone. In
the presence of ultraviolet radiations, molecules of CFCs break down to form chlorine-free
radicals that combine with ozone to form oxygen
Question 7.21:
Describe the manufacture of H2SO4 by contact process?
Answer
Sulphuric acid is manufactured by the contact process. It involves the following steps:
Step (i):
Sulphur or sulphide ores are burnt in air to form SO2.
Step (ii):
By a reaction with oxygen, SO2 is converted into SO3 in the presence of V2O5 as a catalyst.
Step (iii):
SO3 produced is absorbed on H2SO4 to give H2S2O7 (oleum).
This oleum is then diluted to obtain H2SO4 of the desired concentration.
In practice, the plant is operated at 2 bar (pressure) and 720 K (temperature). The sulphuric
acid thus obtained is 96-98% pure
Question 7.22:
How is SO2 an air pollutant?
Answer
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Sulphur dioxide causes harm to the environment in many ways:
1. It combines with water vapour present in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid. This
causes acid rain. Acid rain damages soil, plants, and buildings, especially those made of
marble.
2. Even in very low concentrations, SO2 causes irritation in the respiratory tract. It causes
throat and eye irritation and can also affect the larynx to cause breathlessness.
3. It is extremely harmful to plants. Plants exposed to sulphur dioxide for a long time lose
colour from their leaves. This condition is known as chlorosis. This happens because the
formation of chlorophyll is affected by the presence of sulphur dioxide
Question 7.23:
Why are halogens strong oxidising agents?
Answer
The general electronic configuration of halogens is np5, where n = 2-6. Thus, halogens need
only one more electron to complete their octet and to attain the stable noble gas
configuration. Also, halogens are highly electronegative with low dissociation energies and
high negative electron gain enthalpies. Therefore, they have a high tendency to gain an
electron. Hence, they act as strong oxidizing agents
Question 7.24:
Explain why fluorine forms only one oxoacid, HOF.
Answer
Fluorine forms only one oxoacid i.e., HOF because of its high electronegativity and small size
Question 7.25:
Explain why inspite of nearly the same electronegativity, oxygen forms hydrogen bonding
while chlorine does not.
Answer
Both chlorine and oxygen have almost the same electronegativity values, but chlorine rarely
forms hydrogen bonding. This is because in comparison to chlorine, oxygen has a smaller size
and as a result, a higher electron density per unit volume

Uses of ClO2:
(i) It is used for purifying water.
(ii) It is used as a bleaching agent
Question 7.27:
Why are halogens coloured?
Answer
Almost all halogens are coloured. This is because halogens absorb radiations in the visible
region. This results in the excitation of valence electrons to a higher energy region. Since the
amount of energy required for excitation differs for each halogen, each halogen displays a
different colour

Question 7.34:
With what neutral molecule is ClO− isoelectronic? Is that molecule a Lewis base?
Answer
ClO− is isoelectronic to ClF. Also, both species contain 26 electrons in all as shown.
Total electrons ClO− = 17 + 8 + 1 = 26
In ClF = 17 + 9 = 26
ClF acts like a Lewis base as it accepts electrons from F to form ClF3
Question 7.35:
How are XeO3 and XeOF4 prepared?
Answer
(i) XeO3 can be prepared in two ways as shown.
(ii) XeOF4 can be prepared using XeF6.
Question 7.36:
Arrange the following in the order of property indicated for each set:
(i) F2, Cl2, Br2, I2 - increasing bond dissociation enthalpy.
(ii) HF, HCl, HBr, HI - increasing acid strength.
(iii) NH3, PH3, AsH3, SbH3, BiH3 − increasing base strength.
Answer
(i) Bond dissociation energy usually decreases on moving down a group as the atomic size
increases. However, the bond dissociation energy of F2 is lower than that of Cl2 and Br2. This
is due to the small atomic size of fluorine. Thus, the increasing order for bond dissociation
energy among halogens is as follows:
P BLOCK ELEMENT : NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
I2 < F2 < Br2 < Cl2
(ii) HF < HCl < HBr < HI
The bond dissociation energy of H-X molecules where X = F, Cl, Br, I, decreases with an
increase in the atomic size. Since H-I bond is the weakest, HI is the strongest acid.
(iii) BiH3 ≤ SbH3 < AsH3 < PH3 < NH3
On moving from nitrogen to bismuth, the size of the atom increases while the electron density
on the atom decreases. Thus, the basic strength decreases
Question 7.37:

(iii)
XeO3 is isostructural to

Question 7.39:
Why do noble gases have comparatively large atomic sizes?
Answer
Noble gases do not form molecules. In case of noble gases, the atomic radii corresponds to
van der Waal’s radii. On the other hand, the atomic radii of other elements correspond to their
covalent radii. By definition, van der Waal’s radii are larger than covalent radii. It is for this
reason that noble gases are very large in size as compared to other atoms belonging to the
same period

Question 8.1:
Silver atom has completely filled d orbitals (4d10) in its ground state. How can you say that it
is a transition element?
Answer
Ag has a completely filled 4d orbital (4d10 5s1) in its ground state. Now, silver displays two
oxidation states (+1 and +2). In the +1 oxidation state, an electron is removed from the s-
orboital. However, in the +2 oxidation state, an electron is removed from the d-orbital. Thus,
the d-orbital now becomes incomplete (4d9). Hence, it is a transition element
Question 8.2:
In the series Sc (Z = 21) to Zn (Z = 30), the enthalpy of atomization of zinc is the lowest, i.e.,
126 kJ mol−1. Why?
Answer
The extent of metallic bonding an element undergoes decides the enthalpy of atomization. The
more extensive the metallic bonding of an element, the more will be its enthalpy of
atomization. In all transition metals (except Zn, electronic configuration: 3d10 4s2), there are
some unpaired electrons that account for their stronger metallic bonding. Due to the absence
of these unpaired electrons, the inter-atomic electronic bonding is the weakest in Zn and as a
result, it has the least enthalpy of atomization
Question 8.3:
Which of the 3d series of the transition metals exhibits the largest number of oxidation states
and why?
Answer
Mn (Z = 25) = 3d5 4s2
Mn has the maximum number of unpaired electrons present in the d-subshell (5 electrons).
Hence, Mn exhibits the largest number of oxidation states, ranging from +2 to +7
Question 8.4:
The Eθ(M2+/M) value for copper is positive (+0.34V). What is possibly the reason for this?
(Hint: consider its high ΔaHθ and low ΔhydHθ)
Answer
The Eθ(M2+/M) value of a metal depends on the energy changes involved in the following:
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
1. Sublimation: The energy required for converting one mole of an atom from the solid state
to the gaseous state.
2. Ionization: The energy required to take out electrons from one mole of atoms in the
gaseous state.
3. Hydration: The energy released when one mole of ions are hydrated.
Now, copper has a high energy of atomization and low hydration energy. Hence, the Eθ(M2+/M)
value for copper is positive
Question 8.5:
How would you account for the irregular variation of ionization enthalpies (first and second) in
the first series of the transition elements?
Answer
Ionization enthalpies are found to increase in the given series due to a continuous filling of the
inner d-orbitals. The irregular variations of ionization enthalpies can be attributed to the extra
stability of configurations such as d0, d5, d10. Since these states are exceptionally stable, their
ionization enthalpies are very high.
In case of first ionization energy, Cr has low ionization energy. This is because after losing one
electron, it attains the stable configuration (3d5). On the other hand, Zn has exceptionally high
first ionization energy as an electron has to be removed from stable and fully-filled orbitals
(3d10 4s2).
Second ionization energies are higher than the first since it becomes difficult to remove an
electron when an electron has already been taken out. Also, elements like Cr and Cu have
exceptionally high second ionization energies as after losing the first electron, they have
attained the stable configuration (Cr+: 3d5 and Cu+: 3d10). Hence, taking out one electron
more from this stable configuration will require a lot of energy
Question 8.6:
Why is the highest oxidation state of a metal exhibited in its oxide or fluoride only?

Cr3+ Fe2+
value is −0.41 V and
is +0.77 V. This means that Cr2+ can be easily
oxidized to Cr3+, but Fe2+ does not get oxidized to Fe3+ easily. Therefore, Cr2+ is a better
reducing agent that Fe3+

Question 8.9:
Explain why Cu+ ion is not stable in aqueous solutions?
Answer
In an aqueous medium, Cu2+ is more stable than Cu+. This is because although energy is
required to remove one electron from Cu+ to Cu2+, high hydration energy of Cu2+

compensates for it. Therefore, Cu+ ion in an aqueous solution is unstable. It disproportionates
to give Cu2+ and Cu.
Question 8.10:
Actinoid contraction is greater from element to element than lanthanoid contraction. Why?
Answer
In actinoids, 5f orbitals are filled. These 5f orbitals have a poorer shielding effect than 4f
orbitals (in lanthanoids). Thus, the effective nuclear charge experienced by electrons in
valence shells in case of actinoids is much more that that experienced by lanthanoids. Hence,
the size contraction in actinoids is greater as compared to that in lanthanoids

Question 8.2:
Why are Mn2+compounds more stable than Fe2+ towards oxidation to their +3 state?
Answer
Electronic configuration of Mn2+ is [Ar]18 3d5.
Electronic configuration of Fe2+ is [Ar]18 3d6.
It is known that half-filled and fully-filled orbitals are more stable. Therefore, Mn in (+2) state
has a stable d5 configuration. This is the reason Mn2+ shows resistance to oxidation to Mn3+.
Also, Fe2+ has 3d6 configuration and by losing one electron, its configuration changes to a
more stable 3d5 configuration. Therefore, Fe2+ easily gets oxidized to Fe+3 oxidation state
Question 8.3:
Explain briefly how +2 state becomes more and more stable in the first half
of the first row transition elements with increasing atomic number?
Answer
The oxidation states displayed by the first half of the first row of transition metals are given in
the table below.
Oxidation state
It can be easily observed that except Sc, all others metals display +2 oxidation state. Also, on
moving from Sc to Mn, the atomic number increases from 21 to 25. This means the number of
electrons in the 3d-orbital also increases from 1 to 5.
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Sc (+2) = d1
Ti (+2) = d2
V (+2) = d3
Cr (+2) = d4
Mn (+2) = d5
+2 oxidation state is attained by the loss of the two 4s electrons by these metals. Since the
number of d electrons in (+2) state also increases from Ti(+2) to Mn(+ 2), the stability of +2
state increases (as d-orbital is becoming more and more half-filled). Mn (+2) has d5 electrons
(that is half-filled d shell, which is highly stable)
Question 8.4:
To what extent do the electronic configurations decide the stability of
oxidation states in the first series of the transition elements? Illustrate
your answer with examples.
Answer
The elements in the first-half of the transition series exhibit many oxidation states with Mn
exhibiting maximum number of oxidation states (+2 to +7). The stability of +2 oxidation state
increases with the increase in atomic number. This happens as more electrons are getting
filled in the d-orbital. However, Sc does not show +2 oxidation state. Its electronic
configuration is 4s2 3d1. It loses all the three electrons to form Sc3+. +3 oxidation state of Sc
is very stable as by losing all three electrons, it attains stable noble gas configuration, [Ar]. Ti
(+ 4) and V(+5) are very stable for the same reason. For Mn, +2 oxidation state is very stable
as after losing two electrons, its d-orbital is exactly half-filled, [Ar] 3d5

Question 8.7:
What is lanthanoid contraction? What are the consequences of lanthanoid
contraction?
Answer
As we move along the lanthanoid series, the atomic number increases gradually by one. This
means that the number of electrons and protons present in an atom also increases by one. As
electrons are being added to the same shell, the effective nuclear charge increases. This
happens because the increase in nuclear attraction due to the addition of proton is more
pronounced than the increase in the interelectronic repulsions due to the addition of electron.
Also, with the increase in atomic number, the number of electrons in the 4f orbital also
increases. The 4f electrons have poor shielding effect. Therefore, the effective nuclear charge
experienced by the outer electrons increases. Consequently, the attraction of the nucleus for
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
the outermost electrons increases. This results in a steady decrease in the size of lanthanoids
with the increase in the atomic number. This is termed as lanthanoid contraction.
Consequences of lanthanoid contraction
(i) There is similarity in the properties of second and third transition series.
Separation of lanthanoids is possible due to lanthanide contraction.
(iii) It is due to lanthanide contraction that there is variation in the basic strength of
lanthanide hydroxides. (Basic strength decreases from La(OH)3 to Lu(OH)3.)
Question 8.8:
What are the characteristics of the transition elements and why are they
called transition elements? Which of the d-block elements may not be
regarded as the transition elements?
Answer
Transition elements are those elements in which the atoms or ions (in stable oxidation state)
contain partially filled d-orbital. These elements lie in the d-block and show a transition of
properties between s-block and p-block. Therefore, these are called transition elements.
Elements such as Zn, Cd, and Hg cannot be classified as transition elements because these
have completely filled d-subshell
Question 8.9:
In what way is the electronic configuration of the transition elements different
from that of the non-transition elements?
Answer
Transition metals have a partially filled d−orbital. Therefore, the electronic configuration of
transition elements is (n − 1)d1-10 ns0-2.
The non-transition elements either do not have a d−orbital or have a fully filled d−orbital.
Therefore, the electronic configuration of non-transition elements is ns1-2 or ns2 np1-6
Question 8.10:

Answer
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
In the lanthanide series, +3 oxidation state is most common i.e., Ln(III) compounds are
predominant. However, +2 and +4 oxidation states can also be found in the solution or in
solid compounds
Question 8.11:
Explain giving reasons:
(i) Transition metals and many of their compounds show paramagnetic
behaviour.
(ii) The enthalpies of atomisation of the transition metals are high.
(iii) The transition metals generally form coloured compounds.
(iv) Transition metals and their many compounds act as good catalyst.
Answer
(i) Transition metals show paramagnetic behaviour. Paramagnetism arises due to the
presence of unpaired electrons with each electron having a magnetic moment associated with
its spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum. However, in the first transition
series, the orbital angular momentum is quenched. Therefore, the resulting paramagnetism is
only because of the unpaired electron.
(ii) Transition elements have high effective nuclear charge and a large number of valence
electrons. Therefore, they form very strong metallic bonds. As a result, the enthalpy of
atomization of transition metals is high.
(iii) Most of the complexes of transition metals are coloured. This is because of the absorption
of radiation from visible light region to promote an electron from one of the d−orbitals to
another. In the presence of ligands, the d-orbitals split up into two sets of orbitals having
different energies. Therefore, the transition of electrons can take place from one set
toanother. The energy required for these transitions is quite small and falls in the visible
region of radiation. The ions of transition metals absorb the radiation of a particular
wavelength and the rest is reflected, imparting colour to the solution.
(iv) The catalytic activity of the transition elements can be explained by two basic facts.
(a) Owing to their ability to show variable oxidation states and form complexes, transition
metals form unstable intermediate compounds. Thus, they provide a new path with lower
activation energy, Ea, for the reaction.
(b) Transition metals also provide a suitable surface for the reactions to occur

What are interstitial compounds? Why are such compounds well known for
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION

sites of their crystal lattices. The resulting compounds are called interstitial compounds
Question 8.13:
How is the variability in oxidation states of transition metals different from
that of the non-transition metals? Illustrate with examples.
Answer
In transition elements, the oxidation state can vary from +1 to the highest oxidation state by

(Fe2+ and Fe3+; Cu+ and Cu2+). In non-transition elements, the oxidation states differ by 2, for

Question 8.17:
For M2+/M and M3+/M2+ systems, the

Cr2+/Cr −0.9V
Cr3/Cr2+ −0.4 V
Mn2+/Mn −1.2V
Mn3+ /Mn2+ +1.5 V
Fe2+ /Fe −0.4V
Fe3+/Fe2+ +0.8 V
Use this data to comment upon:
(i) The stability of Fe3+ in acid solution as compared to that of Cr3+ or Mn3+ and
(ii) The ease with which iron can be oxidised as compared to a similar process for either
chromium or manganese metal.
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
Answer
(i) The
value for Fe3+/Fe2+  is higher than that for Cr3+/Cr2+ and lower than that for
Mn3+/Mn2+. So, the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is easier than the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+, but
not as easy as the reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+. Hence, Fe3+ is more stable than Mn3+, but less
stable than Cr3+. These metal ions can be arranged in the increasing order of their stability as:
Mn3+ < Fe3+ < Cr3+
(ii) The reduction potentials for the given pairs increase in the following order.
Mn2+ / Mn < Cr2+ / Cr < Fe2+ /Fe
So, the oxidation of Fe to Fe2+ is not as easy as the oxidation of Cr to Cr2+ and the oxidation of
Mn to Mn2+. Thus, these metals can be arranged in the increasing order of their ability to get
oxidised as: Fe < Cr < Mn

From the above table, it is evident that the maximum number of oxidation states is shown
by Mn, varying from +2 to +7. The number of oxidation states increases on moving from
Sc to Mn. On moving from Mn to Zn, the number of oxidation states decreases due to a
decrease in the number of available unpaired electrons. The relative stability of the +2
oxidation state increases on moving from top to bottom. This is because on moving from
top to bottom, it becomes more and more difficult to remove the third electron from the
d-orbital
Question 8.20:
Compare the chemistry of actinoids with that of the lanthanoids with special reference to:
(i) electronic configuration (iii) oxidation state
(ii) atomic and ionic sizes and (iv) chemical reactivity.
Answer
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(i) Electronic configuration
The general electronic configuration for lanthanoids is [Xe]54 4f0-14 5d0-1 6s2 and that for
actinoids is [Rn]86 5f1-14 6d0-1 7s2. Unlike 4f orbitals, 5f orbitals are not deeply buried and
participate in bonding to a greater extent.
(ii) Oxidation states
The principal oxidation state of lanthanoids is (+3). However, sometimes we also encounter
oxidation states of + 2 and + 4. This is because of extra stability of fully-filled and half-filled
orbitals. Actinoids exhibit a greater range of oxidation states. This is because the 5f, 6d, and
7s levels are of comparable energies. Again, (+3) is the principal oxidation state for actinoids.
Actinoids such as lanthanoids have more compounds in +3 state than in +4 state.
(iii) Atomic and lonic sizes
Similar to lanthanoids, actinoids also exhibit actinoid contraction (overall decrease in atomic
and ionic radii). The contraction is greater due to the poor shielding effect of 5f orbitals.
Chemical reactivity
In the lanthanide series, the earlier members of the series are more reactive. They have
reactivity that is comparable to Ca. With an increase in the atomic number, the lanthanides
start behaving similar to Al. Actinoids, on the other hand, are highly reactive metals,
especially when they are finely divided. When they are added to boiling water, they give a
mixture of oxide and hydride. Actinoids combine with most of the non-metals at moderate
temperatures. Alkalies have no action on these actinoids. In case of acids, they are slightly
affected by nitric acid (because of the formation of a protective oxide layer).
Question 8.21:
How would you account for the following:
(i) Of the d4species, Cr2+ is strongly reducing while manganese(III) is strongly oxidising.
(ii) Cobalt(II) is stable in aqueous solution but in the presence of complexing reagents it is
easily oxidised.
(iii) The d1 configuration is very unstable in ions.
Answer
(i) Cr2+ is strongly reducing in nature. It has a d4 configuration. While acting as a reducing
agent, it gets oxidized to Cr3+ (electronic configuration, d3). This d3 configuration can be
written as
configuration, which is a more stable configuration. In the case of Mn3+ (d4), it
acts as an oxidizing agent and gets reduced to Mn2+ (d5). This has an exactly half-filled d-
orbital and is highly stable.
(ii) Co(II) is stable in aqueous solutions. However, in the presence of strong field complexing
reagents, it is oxidized to Co (III). Although the 3rd ionization energy for Co is high, but the
D AND F BLOCK ELEMENT NCERT SOLUTION
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
higher amount of crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE) released in the presence of strong
field ligands overcomes this ionization energy.
(iii) The ions in d1 configuration tend to lose one more electron to get into stable d0
configuration. Also, the hydration or lattice energy is more than sufficient to remove the only
electron present in the d-orbital of these ions. Therefore, they act as reducing agents
Question 8.22:
What is meant by ‘disproportionation’? Give two examples of disproportionation reaction in
aqueous solution.
Answer
It is found that sometimes a relatively less stable oxidation state undergoes an oxidation-
−reduction reaction in which it is simultaneously oxidised and reduced. This is called
disproportionation.
For example,
Cr(V) is oxidized to Cr(VI) and reduced to Cr(III).
Mn (VI) is oxidized to Mn (VII) and reduced to Mn (IV).
Question 8.23:
Which metal in the first series of transition metals exhibits +1 oxidation state most frequently
and why?
Answer
In the first transition series, Cu exhibits +1 oxidation state very frequently. It is because Cu (
+1) has an electronic configuration of [Ar] 3d10. The completely filled d-orbital makes it highly
stable

Question 8.25:
Give examples and suggest reasons for the following features of the transition metal
chemistry:
(i)The lowest oxide of transition metal is basic, the highest is amphoteric/acidic.
(ii)A transition metal exhibits highest oxidation state in oxides and fluorides.
(iii) The highest oxidation state is exhibited in oxoanions of a metal.
Answer
(i) In the case of a lower oxide of a transition metal, the metal atom has a low oxidation
state. This means that some of the valence electrons of the metal atom are not involved in
bonding. As a result, it can donate electrons and behave as a base.
On the other hand, in the case of a higher oxide of a transition metal, the metal atom has a
high oxidation state. This means that the valence electrons are involved in bonding and so,
they are unavailable. There is also a high effective nuclear charge.
As a result, it can accept electrons and behave as an acid.
For example,
is basic and
is acidic.
(ii) Oxygen and fluorine act as strong oxidising agents because of their high
electronegativities and small sizes. Hence, they bring out the highest oxidation states from the
transition metals. In other words, a transition metal exhibits higher oxidation states in oxides
and fluorides. For example, in OsF6 and V2O5, the oxidation states of Os and V are +6 and +5
respectively.

physical properties than those of the component elements.

Answer
Inner transition metals are those elements in which the last electron enters the f-orbital. The
elements in which the 4f and the 5f orbitals are progressively filled are called f-block
elements. Among the given atomic numbers, the atomic numbers of the inner transition
elements are 59, 95, and 102
Question 8.29:
The chemistry of the actinoid elements is not so smooth as that of the Lanthanoids. Justify this
statement by giving some examples from the oxidation state of these elements.
Answer
Lanthanoids primarily show three oxidation states (+2, +3, +4). Among these oxidation
states, +3 state is the most common. Lanthanoids display a limited number of oxidation states
because the energy difference between 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals is quite large. On the other
hand, the energy difference between 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals is very less. Hence, actinoids
display a large number of oxidation states. For example, uranium and plutonium display +3,
+4, +5, and +6 oxidation states while neptunium displays +3, +4, +5, and +7. The most
common oxidation state in case of actinoids is also +3

Question 8.33:
Compare the chemistry of the actinoids with that of lanthanoids with reference to:

Electronic configuration
The general electronic configuration for lanthanoids is [Xe]54 4f0-14 5d0-1 6s2 and that for
actinoids is [Rn]86 5f1-14 6d0-1 7s2. Unlike 4f orbitals, 5f orbitals are not deeply buried and

configurations.
In the first transition series, two elements show unusual electronic configurations:
Similarly, there are exceptions in the second transition series. These are:

There are some exceptions in the third transition series as well. These are:
As a result of these exceptions, it happens many times that the electronic configurations of the
elements present in the same group are dissimilar.
(ii) In each of the three transition series the number of oxidation states shown by the
elements is the maximum in the middle and the minimum at the extreme ends.
However, +2 and +3 oxidation states are quite stable for all elements present in the first
transition series. All metals present in the first transition series form stable compounds in the
+2 and +3 oxidation states. The stability of the +2 and +3 oxidation states decreases in the
second and the third transition series, wherein higher oxidation states are more important.
For example
are stable complexes, but no
such complexes are known for the second and third transition series such as Mo, W, Rh, In.
They form complexes in which their oxidation states are high. For example: WCl6, ReF7, RuO4,
(iii) In each of the three transition series, the first ionisation enthalpy increases from left to
right. However, there are some exceptions. The first ionisation enthalpies of the third
transition series are higher than those of the first and second transition series. This occurs due
to the poor shielding effect of 4f electrons in the third transition series.
Certain elements in the second transition series have higher first ionisation enthalpies than
elements corresponding to the same vertical column in the first transition series. There are
also elements in the 2nd transition series whose first ionisation enthalpies are lower than those
of the elements corresponding to the same vertical column in the 1st transition series.
(iv) Atomic size generally decreases from left to right across a period. Now, among the three

those of the elements corresponding to the same vertical column in the first transition series.
However, the atomic sizes of the elements in the third transition series are virtually the same

(i) The atomic sizes of the elements of the first transition series are smaller than those of the
heavier elements (elements of 2nd and 3rd transition series).
However, the atomic sizes of the elements in the third transition series are virtually the same
as those of the corresponding members in the second transition series. This is due to
lanthanoid contraction.
(ii) +2 and +3 oxidation states are more common for elements in the first transition series,
while higher oxidation states are more common for the heavier elements.
(iii) The enthalpies of atomisation of the elements in the first transition series are lower than
those of the corresponding elements in the second and third transition series.
(iv) The melting and boiling points of the first transition series are lower than those of the
heavier transition elements. This is because of the occurrence of stronger metallic bonding
(M−M bonding).

upon the strength of the ligand field. However, the heavier transition elements form only low-
spin complexes, irrespective of the strength of the ligand field

Answer
Ni is in the +2 oxidation state i.e., in d8 configuration.
There are 4 CN− ions. Thus, it can either have a tetrahedral geometry or square planar
geometry. Since CN− ion is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons.

It now undergoes dsp2 hybridization. Since all electrons are paired, it is diamagnetic.
In case of [NiCl4]2−, Cl− ion is a weak field ligand. Therefore, it does not lead to the pairing of
unpaired 3d electrons. Therefore, it undergoes sp3 hybridization.
Since there are 2 unpaired electrons in this case, it is paramagnetic in nature
Question 9.6:
[NiCl4]2− is paramagnetic while [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic though both are tetrahedral. Why?
Answer
Though both [NiCl4]2− and [Ni(CO)4] are tetrahedral, their magnetic characters are different.
This is due to a difference in the nature of ligands. Cl− is a weak field ligand and it does not
cause the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons. Hence, [NiCl4]2− is paramagnetic.
In Ni(CO)4, Ni is in the zero oxidation state i.e., it has a configuration of 3d8 4s2.
But CO is a strong field ligand. Therefore, it causes the pairing of unpaired 3d electrons. Also,
it causes the 4s electrons to shift to the 3d orbital, thereby giving rise to sp3 hybridization.
Since no unpaired electrons are present in this case, [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic
Question 9.7:
[Fe(H2O)6]3+ is strongly paramagnetic whereas [Fe(CN)6]3− is weakly paramagnetic. Explain.

(i) A metal exhibits two types of valencies namely, primary and secondary valencies. Primary
valencies are satisfied by negative ions while secondary valencies are satisfied by both
negative and neutral ions.
COORDINATION COMPOUND AND ITS CHEMISTRY
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(In modern terminology, the primary valency corresponds to the oxidation number of the
metal ion, whereas the secondary valency refers to the coordination number of the metal ion.
(ii) A metal ion has a definite number of secondary valencies around the central atom. Also,
these valencies project in a specific direction in the space assigned to the definite geometry of
the coordination compound.
(iii) Primary valencies are usually ionizable, while secondary valencies are non-ionizable
Question 9.2:
FeSO4 solution mixed with (NH4)2SO4 solution in 1:1 molar ratio gives the test of Fe2+ ion but
CuSO4 solution mixed with aqueous ammonia in 1:4 molar ratio does not give the test of Cu2+
ion. Explain why?
Answer
Both the compounds i.e.,
under the category of addition compounds with only one major difference i.e., the former is an
example of a double salt, while the latter is a coordination compound.
A double salt is an addition compound that is stable in the solid state but that which breaks up
into its constituent ions in the dissolved state. These compounds exhibit individual properties
of their constituents. For e.g.
breaks into Fe2+, NH4+, and SO4
ions. Hence, it gives a positive test for Fe2+ ions.
A coordination compound is an addition compound which retains its identity in the solid as well
as in the dissolved state. However, the individual properties of the constituents are lost. This
happens because

Answer
COORDINATION COMPOUND AND ITS CHEMISTRY
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
(i) Coordination entity:
A coordination entity is an electrically charged radical or species carrying a positive or
negative charge. In a coordination entity, the central atom or ion is surrounded by a suitable
number of neutral molecules or negative ions ( called ligands). For example:
= cationic complex
= anionic complex
= neutral complex
(ii) Ligands
The neutral molecules or negatively charged ions that surround the metal atom in a
coordination entity or a coordinal complex are known as ligands. For example,
Cl−, −OH. Ligands are usually polar in nature and possess at least one unshared pair of
valence electrons.
(iii) Coordination number:
The total number of ligands (either neutral molecules or negative ions) that get attached to
the central metal atom in the coordination sphere is called the coordination number of the
central metal atom. It is also referred to as its ligancy.
For example:
(a) In the complex, K2[PtCl6], there as six chloride ions attached to Pt in the coordinate
sphere. Therefore, the coordination number of Pt is 6.
(b) Similarly, in the complex [Ni(NH3)4]Cl2, the coordination number of the central atom (Ni) is
(vi) Coordination polyhedron:

entities of differnet metal ions present in the complex.
[Co(NH3)6] [Cr(CN)6] and [Cr(NH3)6] [Co(CN)6]
(e) Ionization isomerism:
This type of isomerism arises when a counter ion replaces a ligand within the coordination
sphere. Thus, complexes that have the same composition, but furnish different ions when
dissolved in water are called ionization isomers. For e.g., Co(NH3)5SO4)Br and Co(NH3)5Br]SO4.
(f) Solvate isomerism:
Solvate isomers differ by whether or not the solvent molecule is directly bonded to the metal
ion or merely present as a free solvent molecule in the crystal lattice.

Orbitals of Fe2+ ion:
As CN− is a strong field ligand, it causes the pairing of the unpaired 3d electrons.
Since there are six ligands around the central metal ion, the most feasible hybridization is
d2sp3.
d2sp3 hybridized orbitals of Fe2+ are:
6 electron pairs from CN− ions occupy the six hybrid d2sp3orbitals.
Then,
Hence, the geometry of the complex is octahedral and the complex is diamagnetic (as there
are no unpaired electrons).
(ii) [FeF6]3−
In this complex, the oxidation state of Fe is +3.

Orbitals of Fe+3 ion:
There are 6 F− ions. Thus, it will undergo d2sp3 or sp3d2 hybridization. As F− is a weak field
ligand, it does not cause the pairing of the electrons in the 3d orbital. Hence, the most feasible
hybridization is sp3d2.
sp3d2 hybridized orbitals of Fe are:
Hence, the geometry of the complex is found to be octahedral.
(iii) [Co(C2O4)3]3−
Cobalt exists in the +3 oxidation state in the given complex.
Orbitals of Co3+ ion:
Oxalate is a weak field ligand. Therefore, it cannot cause the pairing of the 3d orbital
electrons. As there are 6 ligands, hybridization has to be either sp3d2 or d2sp3 hybridization.

Question 9.17:
What is spectrochemical series? Explain the difference between a weak field ligand and a
strong field ligand.
Answer
A spectrochemical series is the arrangement of common ligands in the increasing order of their
crystal-field splitting energy (CFSE) values. The ligands present on the R.H.S of the series are
strong field ligands while that on the L.H.S are weak field ligands. Also, strong field ligands
cause higher splitting in the d orbitals than weak field ligands.

2− < NO2
− < phen < CO
Question 9.18:
What is crystal field splitting energy? How does the magnitude of Δo decide the actual
configuration of d-orbitals in a coordination entity?
Answer
The degenerate d-orbitals (in a spherical field environment) split into two levels i.e., eg and t2g
in the presence of ligands. The splitting of the degenerate levels due to the presence of
ligands is called the crystal-field splitting while the energy difference between the two levels
(eg and t2g) is called the crystal-field splitting energy. It is denoted by Δo.
After the orbitals have split, the filling of the electrons takes place. After 1 electron (each) has
been filled in the three t2g orbitals, the filling of the fourth electron takes place in two ways. It
can enter the eg orbital (giving rise to t2g
1 like electronic configuration) or the pairing of the
electrons can take place in the t2g orbitals (giving rise to t2g
0 like electronic configuration).
If the Δo value of a ligand is less than the pairing energy (P), then the electrons enter the eg
orbital. On the other hand, if the Δo value of a ligand is more than the pairing energy (P), then
the electrons enter the t2g orbital

Question 9.19:
[Cr(NH3)6]3+ is paramagnetic while [Ni(CN)4]2− is diamagnetic. Explain why?
Answer
Cr is in the +3 oxidation state i.e., d3 configuration. Also, NH3 is a weak field ligand that does
not cause the pairing of the electrons in the 3d orbital.
Therefore, it undergoes d2sp3 hybridization and the electrons in the 3d orbitals remain
unpaired. Hence, it is paramagnetic in nature.
In [Ni(CN)4]2−, Ni exists in the +2 oxidation state i.e., d8 configuration.
Ni2+:
CN− is a strong field ligand. It causes the pairing of the 3d orbital electrons. Then, Ni2+
undergoes dsp2 hybridization.
As there are no unpaired electrons, it is diamagnetic
Question 9.20:
A solution of [Ni(H2O)6]2+ is green but a solution of [Ni(CN)4]2− is colourless. Explain.
Answer
In [Ni(H2O)6]2+,
is a weak field ligand. Therefore, there are unpaired electrons in Ni2+. In
this complex, the d electrons from the lower energy level can be excited to the higher energy
level i.e., the possibility of d−d transition is present. Hence, Ni(H2O)6]2+ is coloured.
In [Ni(CN)4]2−, the electrons are all paired as CN- is a strong field ligand. Therefore, d-d
transition is not possible in [Ni(CN)4]2−. Hence, it is colourless
Question 9.21:
COORDINATION COMPOUND AND ITS CHEMISTRY
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
[Fe(CN)6]4− and [Fe(H2O)6]2+ are of different colours in dilute solutions. Why?
Answer
The colour of a particular coordination compound depends on the magnitude of the crystal-
field splitting energy, Δ. This CFSE in turn depends on the nature of the ligand. In case of
[Fe(CN)6]4− and [Fe(H2O)6]2+, the colour differs because there is a difference in the CFSE.
Now, CN− is a strong field ligand having a higher CFSE value as compared to the CFSE value of
water. This means that the absorption of energy for the intra d-d transition also differs. Hence,
the transmitted colour also differs
Question 9.22:
Discuss the nature of bonding in metal carbonyls.
Answer
The metal-carbon bonds in metal carbonyls have both σ and π characters. A σ bond is formed
when the carbonyl carbon donates a lone pair of electrons to the vacant orbital of the metal. A
π bond is formed by the donation of a pair of electrons from the filled metal d orbital into the
vacant anti-bonding π* orbital (also known as back bonding of the carbonyl group). The σ
bond strengthens the π bond and vice-versa. Thus, a synergic effect is created due to this
metal-ligand bonding. This synergic effect strengthens the bond between CO and the metal.

Question 9.25:
What is meant by stability of a coordination compound in solution? State the factors which
govern stability of complexes.
Answer
COORDINATION COMPOUND AND ITS CHEMISTRY
PREPARED BY MANISH TULI PRINCIPAL KV HIRANAGAR
The stability of a complex in a solution refers to the degree of association between the two
species involved in a state of equilibrium. Stability can be expressed quantitatively in terms of
stability constant or formation constant.
For this reaction, the greater the value of the stability constant, the greater is the proportion
of ML3 in the solution.
Stability can be of two types:
(a) Thermodynamic stability:
The extent to which the complex will be formed or will be transformed into another species at
the point of equilibrium is determined by thermodynamic stability.
(b) Kinetic stability:
This helps in determining the speed with which the transformation will occur to attain the state
of equilibrium.
Factors that affect the stability of a complex are:
(a) Charge on the central metal ion: Thegreater the charge on the central metal ion, the
greater is the stability of the complex.
2. Basic nature of the ligand: A more basic ligand will form a more stable complex.
2. Presence of chelate rings: Chelation increases the stability of complexes
Question 9.26:
What is meant by the chelate effect? Give an example.
Answer
When a ligand attaches to the metal ion in a manner that forms a ring, then the metal- ligand
association is found to be more stable. In other words, we can say that complexes containing
chelate rings are more stable than complexes without rings. This is known as the chelate
effect.

The central metal ion in all the three complexes is the same. Therefore, absorption in the
visible region depends on the ligands. The order in which the CFSE values of the ligands

H2O < NH3 < NO2
Thus, the amount of crystal-field splitting observed will be in the following order:
Hence, the wavelengths of absorption in the visible region will be in the order:
[Ni(H2O)6]2+ > [Ni(NH3)6]2+ > [Ni(NO2)6]4−
