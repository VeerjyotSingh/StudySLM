Financial Statements - II
n chapter 9, you learnt about the preparation of
simple final accounts in the format of trading and
profit and loss account and balance sheet. The
preparation of simple final accounts pre-supposes
the absence of any accounting complexities which
are normal to business operations. These
complexities arise due to the fact that the process
of determining income and financial position is
based on the accrual basis of accounting. This
emphasises that while ascertaining the profitability,
the revenues be considered on earned basis and
not on receipt basis, and the expenses be considered
on incurred basis and not on paid basis. Hence,
many items need some adjustment while preparing
the financial statements. In this chapter we shall
discuss all items which require adjustments and
the way these are brought into the books of account
and incorporated in the final accounts.
10.1 Need for Adjustments
According to accrual concept of accounting, the
profit or loss for an accounting year is not based on
the revenues realised in cash and the expenses paid
in cash during that year because there may be some
receipts of incomes and payments of expenses
during the current year which may partially relate
to the previous year or to the next year. Also, there
may be some incomes and expenses relating to the
current year that are still to be brought into books
of account. So, unless such items duly adjusted,
the final accounts will not reflect the true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the business.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter,
you will be able to :
describe the need for
adjustments while
preparing the financial
statements;
explain the accounting
treatment of adjust-
ments for outstanding
and prepaid expenses,
accrued and advance
receipts of incomes;
discuss the adjust-
ments to be made
regarding deprecia-
tion, bad debts, provi-
sion for doubtful debts,
provision for discount
on debtors;
explain the concepts
and adjustment of
manager’s commission
and interest on capital;
prepare profit and loss
account and balance
sheet with adjust-
ments; and
make vertical present-
ation of financial
statements.
Financial Statements - II
Let us take an example of an amount of Rs. 1,000 paid on July 01, 2005
towards insurance premium. You understand that any general insurance
premium paid usually covers a period of 12 months. Suppose the accounting
year ends on March 31, 2006, it would mean that one fourth of the insurance
premium is paid on July 01, 2005 relate to the next accounting year 2006-07.
Therefore, while preparing the financial statements for 2005-06, the expense
on insurance premium that should be debited to the profit and loss account
is Rs. 900 (Rs. 1,200 – Rs. 300).
Let us take another example. The salaries for the month of March, 2005
were paid on April 07, 2005. This means that the salaries account of 2004-05
does not include the salaries for the month of March 2005. Such unpaid
salaries is termed as salaries outstanding which have to be brought into books
of account and is debited to profit and loss account along with the salaries
already paid for the month of April, 2004 up to Feburary, 2005.
Similarly, adjustments may also become necessary in respect of certain
incomes received in advance or those which have accrued but are still to be
received. Apart from these, there are certain items which are not recorded on
day-to-day basis such as depreciation on fixed assets, interest on capital, etc.
These are adjusted at the time of preparing financial statements. The purpose
of making various adjustments is to ensure that the final accounts reveal the
true profit or loss and the true financial position of the business. The items
which usually need adjustments are :
1. Closing stock
2. Outstanding/expenses
3. Prepaid/Unexpired expenses
4. Accrued income
5. Income received in advance
6. Depreciation
7. Bad debts
8. Provision for doubtful debts
9. Provision for discount on debtors
10. Manager’s commission
11. Interest on capital
It may be noted that when we prepare the financial statements, we are
provided with the trial balance and some other additional information in respect
of the adjustments to be made. All adjustments are reflected in the final
accounts at two places to complete the double entry. Our earlier example in
chapter 9 which represents the trial balance of Ankit is reproduced in
figure 10.1:

Figure 10.1 : Showing the trial balance of Ankit
We will now study about the items of adjustments and you will observe
how these adjustments are helpful in the preparation  of financial statements
in order to reflect the true profit and loss and financial position of the firm.
10.2 Closing Stock
As already discussed in chapter 9, the closing stock represents the cost of
unsold goods lying in the stores at the end of the accounting period. The
adjustment with regard to the closing stock is done by (i) by crediting it to the
trading and profit and loss account, and (ii) by showing it on the asset side of
the balance sheet. The adjustment entry to be recorded in this regard is :
Closing stock A/c
To Trading A/c
The closing stock of the year becomes the opening stock of the next year
and is reflected  in the trial balance of the next year. The trading and profit

sheet as on that date shall appear as follows :

Sometimes the opening and closing stock are adjusted through purchases
account. In that case, the entry recorded is as follows :
Closing stock A/c
To Purchases A/c
This entry reduces the amount in the purchases account and is  also
known as adjusted purchases which is shown on the debit side of the trading
and profit and loss account. In this context,  it may be noted, that the closing
stock will not be shown on the credit side of the trading and profit and loss as
it has been already been adjusted through the purchases account. Not only,
in such a situation, even the opening stock will not be separately reflected in
the trading and profit and loss account, as it is also adjusted in purchases by
recording the following entry:
Purchases A/c
To Opening stock A/c
Another important point to be noted in this context is that when the opening
and closing stocks are adjusted through purchases, the trial balance does
not show any opening stock. Instead, the closing stock shall appear in the
trial balance (not as additional information or as an adjustment item) and so
also the adjusted purchases. In such a situation, you should remember that
the adjusted purchases shall be debited to the trading and profit and loss
account.

10.3 Outstanding Expenses
It is quite common for a business enterprise to have some unpaid expenses in
the normal course of business operations at the end of an accounting year.
Such items usually are wages, salaries, interest on loan, etc.
When expenses of an accounting period remain unpaid at the end of an
accounting period, they are termed as outstanding expenses.  As they relate
to the earning of revenue during the current accounting year, it is logical that
they should be duly charged against revenue for computation of the correct
amount of profit or loss. The entry to bring such expenses into account is :
Concerned expense A/c
To Outstanding expense A/c
The above entry opens a new account called Outstanding Expenses which
is shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The amount of outstanding
expenses is added to the total of expenses under a particular head for the
purpose of preparing trading and profit and loss account.
For example, refer to Ankit’s trial balance (refer figure 10.1). You will notice
that wages are shown at Rs. 8,000. Let us assume that Ankit owes Rs.500 as
wages relating to the year 2004-05 to one of his employees. In that case, the
correct expense on wages amounts to Rs. 8,500 instead of Rs. 8,000. Ankit
must show Rs. 8,500 as expense on account of wages in the trading and
profit and loss account and recognise a current liability of Rs. 500 towards
the sum owed to his staff. It will be referred to as wages outstanding and it
will be adjusted to wages account by recording the following journal entry:
Wages A/c
To Wages outstanding A/c
Financial Statements - II
The amount of outstanding wages will be added to wages account for the
preparation of the trading and profit and loss account as follows :

10.4 Prepaid Expenses
There are several items of expense which are paid in advance in the normal
course of business operations. At the end of the accounting year, it is found
that the benefits of such expenses have not yet been fully received; a portion
Accountancy
of its benefit would be received in the next accounting year. This portion of
expense, is carried forward to the next year and is termed  as prepaid expenses.
The necessary adjustment in respect of prepaid expenses is made by recording
the following entry:
Prepaid expense A/c
To concerned expense A/c
The effect of the above adjustment entry is that the amount of prepaid
part is deducted from the total of the particular expense, and the new account
of prepaid expense is shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. For
example, in Ankit’s trial balance, let us assume that the amount of salary
paid by him to the employees includes an amount of Rs. 5,000 which was
paid in advance to one of his employees upon his joining the office. This
implies that Ankit has overpaid his staff by Rs. 5,000 on account of his salary.
Hence, correct expense on account of salary  during the current period will be
Rs. 20,000 instead of Rs. 25,000. Ankit must show Rs. 20,000 expense on
account of salary in the profit and loss account and recognise a current asset
of Rs. 5,000 as an advance salary to the employee. It will be termed as prepaid
salary account and will be  recorded by  the following journal entry :
Prepaid salary A/c
5,000
To salary A/c
5,000
The account  of prepaid salary will be shown in the trading and profit and
loss account as follows:

10.5 Accrued Income
It may also happen that certain items of income such as interest on loan,
commission, rent, etc. are earned during the current accounting year but
have not been actually received by the end of the same year. Such incomes
are known as accrued income. The adjusting entry for accrued income is :
Accrued income  A/c
To Concerned income A/c
The amount of accrued income will be added to the related income in the
profit and loss account and the new account of accrued income will appear
on the asset side of the balance sheet.
Let us, for example, assume that Ankit was giving a little help to a fellow
businessman by introducing few parties to him on commission for this service.
In the trial balance of Ankit you will notice an item of commission received
amounting to Rs. 5,000. Assume that the commission amounting to
Rs.1, 500 was still receivable from the fellow businessman. This implies that
income from commission earned during 2004-05 is Rs. 6, 500 (Rs.5, 000 +
Rs. 1,500) Ankit needs to record an adjustment entry to give effect to the
accrued commission as follows :
Accrued Commission A/c
1,500
To Commission A/c
1,500

The account of accrued income will be recorded in trading and profit and

10.6 Income Received in Advance
Sometimes, a certain income is received but the whole amount of it does not
belong to the current period. The portion of the income which belongs to the
next accounting period is termed as income received in advance or an Unearned
Income. Income received in advance is adjusted by recording the following
entry:
Concerned income A/c
To Income received in advance A/c
The effect of this entry will be that the balance in the income account will
be equal to the amount of income earned for the current accounting period,
and the new account of income received in advance will be shown as a liability
in the balance sheet.
For example, let us assume Ankit has agreed in March 31, 2005 to sublet
a part of the building to a fellow shopkeeper @ Rs. 1,000 per month. The
person gives him rent in advance for the next three months of April, May and
June. The amount received had been credited to the profit and loss account.
However, this income does not pertain to current year and hence will not be
credited to profit and loss account. It is income received in advance and will
be recognised as a liability amounting to Rs. 3,000. Ankit needs to record an
adjustment entry to give effect to income received in advance by way of following
journal entry:
Rent received A/c
3,000
To Rent received in advance A/c
3,000
This will lead a new account of rent received in advance of Rs. 3,000 which
will appear as follows :

10.7 Depreciation
Recall from chapter 7, that depreciation is the decline in the value of assets
on account of wear and tear and  passage of time. It is treated as a business
expense and is debited to profit and loss account. This, in effect, amounts to
writing-off a portion of the cost of an asset which has been used in the business
for the purpose of earning profits. The entry for providing depreciation is :
Depreciation A/c
To Concerned asset A/c
In the balance sheet, the asset will be shown at cost minus the amount of
depreciation. For example, the trial balance in our example shows that Ankit
has a furniture account with a balance of Rs. 15,000. Let us assume that
furniture is subject to a depreciation of 10% per annum. This implies that
Ankit must recognise that at the end of the year the value attached to furniture
is to be reduced  by Rs. 1,500 (Rs. 15,000  10%). Ankit needs to record an
adjustment entry to give effect to depreciation on furniture as follows :
Depreciation A/c
1,500
To Furniture A/c
1,500
Depreciation will be shown in the profit and loss account and balance
sheet as follows :

10.8 Bad Debts
Bad debts refer to the amount that the firm has not been able to realise from
its debtors. It is  regarded as a loss and is termed as bad debt. The entry for
recording bad debt is:
Bad debts A/c
To Debtors A/c
You will notice in Ankit’s trial balance, that it contains bad debts amounting
to Rs. 4,500. Whereas, the sundry debtors of Ankit are reported as Rs. 15,500.
The existence of bad debts in the trial balance signifies that Ankit has incurred
a loss arising out of  bad debts during the year and which has been already
recorded in the books of account.
However, assuming one of his debtors who owed him Rs. 2,500 had become
insolvent, and nothing is receivable from him. But the amount of bad debts
related to the current year is still to be account for. This fact appears as
additional information and is termed as further bad debts. The adjustment
entry to be recorded for the amount will be as follows. For this purpose, Ankit
needs to record an adjustment entry as under :
Bad debts A/c
2,500
To Debtors A/c
2,500
This entry will reduce the value of debtors to Rs. 13,000( Rs. 15,500 –
Rs. 2,500) and increases the amount of bad debts to Rs. 7,000 (Rs. 4,500 +
Rs. 2,500).

10.9 Provision for Bad and Doubtful Debts
In the above balance sheet, debtors now appears at Rs. 13,000, which is their
estimated realisable value during next year. It is quite possible that the whole
Financial Statements - II
of this amount may not be realised in future. However, it is not possible to
accurately know the amount of such bad debts. Hence, we make a reasonable
estimate of such loss and provide the same. Such provision is called  provision
for bad debts and  is created by debiting profit and loss account. The following
journal entry is recorded in this context :
Profit and Loss A/c
To  Provision for doubtful debts A/c
Provision for doubtful debts is also shown as a deduction from the debtors
on the asset side of the balance sheet.
Let us assume, Ankit feels that 5% of his debtors on March 31, 2005 are
likely to default on their payments next year. This implies he expects bad
debts of Rs. 650 (Rs. 13,000  5%). Ankit needs to record the adjustment
entry as :
Profit and loss A/c
To Provision for doubtful debts A/c
This implies that Rs. 650 will reduce the current year’s profit on account
of doubtful debts. In the balance sheet, it will be shown as a deduction from
sundry debtors.

It may be noted that the provision created for doubtful debts at the end of
a particular year will be carried forward to the next year and it will be used for
meeting the loss due to bad debts incurred during the next year. The provision
for doubtful debts brought forward from the previous year is called the opening
provision or old provision. When such a provision already exists, the loss due
to bad debts during the current year are adjusted against the same and while
making provision for doubtful debts required at the end of the current year is
called new provision. The balance of old provision as given in trial balance
should also be taken into account.
Let us take an example to understand how bad debts and provision for
doubtful debts are recorded. An extract from a trial balance on March 31,
2005 is given below :
Sundry debtors
32,000
Bad debts
2,000
Provision for doubtful debts

Additional Information :
Write-off further bad debts Rs. 1,000 and create a provision for doubtful debts
@ 5% on debtors.

10.10 Provision for Discount on Debtors
A business enterprise allows discount to its debtors to encourage prompt
payments. Discount likely to be allowed to customers in an accounting year
Accountancy
can be estimated and provided for by creating a provision for discount on
debtors. Provision for discount is made on good debtors which are arrived at
by deducting further bad debts and the provision for doubtful debts. The
following journal entry is recorded to create provision for discount on debtors:
Profit and loss A/c
To Provision for discount on debtors A/c
As stated above, the provision for discount on debtors will be created only
on good debtors. It will be calculated on the amount of debtors arrived at after
deducting the doubtful debts, i.e. Rs. 12,350 (Rs. 13,000 – Rs. 650).
Ankit needs to record the adjustment entry as :
Profit and loss A/c
To Provision for discount on debtors A/c
This will reduce the current year profit by Rs. 227 on account of probable
discount on prompt payment. In the balance sheet, it will be shown as a
deduction from the debtors account to portray correctly the expected realiable
value of debtors as Rs. 12,123.

10.11 Manager’s Commission
The manager of the business is sometimes given the commission on the net
profit of the company. The percentage of the commission is applied on the
profit either before charging such commission or after charging such commission.
In the absence of any such information, it is assumed that commission is
allowed as a percentage of the net profit before charging such commission.
Suppose the net profit of a business is  Rs. 110 before charging commission.
If the manager is entitled to 10% of the profit before charging such commission,
the commission will be calculated as :
= Rs. 110  10/100
= Rs. 11
Accountancy
In case the commission is 10% of the profit after charging such commission,
it will be calculated as :
= Profit before commission  Rate of commission/ (100 + commission)
✶ ❘s✳
The managers commission will be adjusted in the books of account by
recording the following entry :
Profit and loss A/c
To Manager’s commission A/c
Let us recall our example and assume that Ankit’s manager is entitled to a
commission @ 10%. Observe the following profit and loss account if it is based
amount of net profit before charging such commission
amount of profit after charging such commission.

10.12 Interest on Capital
Sometimes, the proprietor may like to know the profit made by the business
after providing for interest on capital. In such a situation, interest is calculated
at a given rate of interest on capital as at the beginning of the accounting
year. If however, any additional capital is brought during the year, the interest
may also be computed on such amount from the date on which it was brought
into the business. Such interest is treated as expense for the business and
the following journal entry is recorded in the books of account:
Interest on capital A/c
To Capital A/c
In the final accounts, it is shown as an expense on the debit side of the
profit and loss account and added to capital in the balance sheet.
Let us assume, Ankit decides to provide 5% interest on his capital. This
shall amount to Rs. 600 for which the following journal entry will be recorded:
Interest on capital A/c
To Capital A/c
This implies that net profit shall be reduced by Rs. 600. As a result, the
reduced amount of profit shall be added to the capital in the balance sheet.
Financial Statements - II
But, when interest on capital shall be added to the capital, this effect shall be
neutralised. As shown below :

10.13 Methods of Presenting the Financial Statements
The financial statements, i.e. trading and profit and loss account and balance
sheet can be presented in two ways:
Horizontal form
Vertical form
Under horizontal form of presentation, items are shown side by side in the
trading and profit and loss account and also in the balance sheet as we are
doing so far. This format is rather technical in nature and is not easily
comprehensible for many users. Hence, now-a-days, most firms present them
in a simpler and more intelligible form called a narrative style or vertical
presentation. Under vertical presentation, the final accounts are prepared in
a form of statement with different items being shown on below the other in a
purposeful sequence. Under vertical presentation, the  trading and profit and
loss account will appear as shown in figure 10.3.

Summary with Reference to Learning Objectives
Need for adjustments : For the preparation of financial statements, it is
necessary that all the adjustments arising out of the accrual basis of accounting
are made at the end of the accounting period. Another important consideration
in the preparation of final accounts with adjustments, is the distinction
between capital and revenue items. Entries which are recorded to give effect to
these adjustments are known as adjusting entries.
Outstanding expenses : At the end of the accounting period sometimes a business
enterprises is left with some unpaid expenses due to one reason or another.
Such expenses are termed as outstanding expenses.
Accountancy
Prepaid expenses : At the end of the accounting year, it is found that the
benefits of some expenses have not been fully received; a portion of total
benefits would be received in the next accounting year. That portion of the
expense, the benefit of which will be received during the next accounting
period is known as ‘prepaid expenses’.
Accrued Income : These are certain items is received by a business enterprise
but the whole amount of it does not belong to the next period. Such portion of
income which belongs to the next accounting period is income received in advance
and is known as “unearned income”.
Depreciation : Depreciation is the decline in the value of an asset an account of
wear and tear or passage of time or with. It actually amounts to writing off a
portion of the cost of an asset which has been used in the business for the
purpose of earning profits. In the balance sheet, the asset is shown at loss
minus the amount of depreciation.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts : It is a normal feature of business
operations that some debts prove irrecoverable which means that the amount
to the realised from them becomes had to view of this. An attempt is made to
bring in a certain element of certainty in the amount in respect of bad debts
charged every year against incomes.

Accounts from Incomplete Records
e have so far studied accounting records of
firms, which follow the double entry system of
book keeping. This gives us an impression that all
business units follow this system. However, in practice,
all firms do not maintain accounting records strictly as
per the double entry system. Many small size enterprises
keep incomplete records of their transactions. But, they
also have to ascertain the profit or loss for the year
and the financial position of the firm as at the end of
the year. This chapter deals with the ascertainment of
profit or loss and financial position of the firm that have
not been maintaining records as per double entry book-
keeping or whose records are otherwise incomplete.
11.1 Meaning of Incomplete Records
Accounting records, which are not strictly kept
according to double entry system are known as
incomplete records. Many authors describe it as single
entry system. However, single entry system is a
misnomer because there is no such system of
maintaining accounting records.  It is also not a ‘short
cut’ method as an alternative to double entry system.
It is rather a mechanism of maintaining records
whereby some transactions are recorded with proper
debits and credits while in case of others, either one
sided or no entry is made. Normally, under this system
records of cash and personal accounts of debtors and
creditors are properly maintained, while the
information relating to assets, liabilities, expenses
and revenues is partially recorded. Hence, these are
usually referred as incomplete records.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After
studying
chapter, you will be able
state the meaning and
features of incomplete
records;
calculate profit or loss
using the statement of
affairs method;
distinguish between
balance sheet and
statement of affairs;
prepare trading and
profit and loss account
and balance sheet from
incomplete records;
detect the missing
figures/information by
preparing relevant
accounts.
Accountancy
11.1.1 Features of Incomplete Records
In complete records may be due to partial recording of transactions as is the
case with small shopkeepers such as grocers and vendors. In case of large
sized organisations, the accounting records may be rendered to the state of
incompleteness due to natural calamity, theft or fire. The features of incomplete
records are as under :
It is an unsystematic method of recording transactions.
Generally, records for cash transactions and personal accounts are
properly maintained and there is no information regarding revenue and/
or gains, expenses and/or losses, assets and liabilities.
Personal transactions of owners may also be recorded in the cash book.
Different organisations maintain records according to their convenience
and needs, and their accounts are not comparable due to lack of
uniformity.
To ascertain profit or loss or for obtaining any other information,
necessary figures can be collected only from the original vouchers such
as sales invoice or purchase invoice, etc. Thus, dependence on original
vouchers is inevitable.
The profit or loss for the year cannot be ascertained under this system
with high degree of accuracy as only an estimate of the profit earned or
loss incurred can be made. The balance sheet also may not reflect the
complete and true position of assets and liabilities.
11.2 Reasons of Incompleteness and its Limitations
It is observed, that many businessmen keep incomplete records because of
the following reasons :
(a) This system can be adopted by people who do not have the proper
knowledge of accounting principles;
(b) It is an inexpensive mode of maintaining records. Cost involved is low
as specialised accountants are not appointed by the organisations;
(c) Time consumed in maintaining records is less as only a few books are
maintained;
(d) It is a convenient mode of maintaining records as the owner may record
only important transactions according to the need of the business.
However, the mechanism of incomplete records suffers from a number of
limitations. This is due to the basic nature of this mechanism. Broadly
speaking, unless a systematic approach to maintenance of records is followed,
reliable financial statements cannot be prepared.
Accounts from Incomplete Records
The limitations of incomplete records are as follows :
(a) As double entry system is not followed, a trial balance cannot be prepared
and accuracy of accounts cannot be ensured.
(b) Correct ascertainment and evaluation of financial result of business
operations can not be made.
(c) Analysis of profitability, liquidity and solvency of the business cannot
be done.  This may cause a problem in raising funds from outsiders and
planning future business activities.
(d) The owners face great difficulty in filing an insurance claim with an
insurance company in case of loss of inventory by fire or theft.
(e) It becomes difficult to convince the income tax authorities about the
reliability of the computed income.
11.3 Ascertainment of Profit and Loss
Every business firm wishes to ascertain the results of its operations to assess
its efficiency and success and failures. This gives rise to the need for preparing
the financial statements to disclose:
(a) the profit made or loss sustained by the firm during a given period; and
(b) the amount of assets and liabilities as at the closing date of the
accounting period.
Therefore, the problem faced in this situation is how to use the available
information in the incomplete records to ascertain the profit or loss for the
particular accounting year and to determine the financial position of a entity
as at the end of the year. This can be done in two ways :
1. Preparing the Statement of Affairs as at the beginning and as at the end
of the accounting period, called statement of affairs or net worth method.
2. Preparing Trading and Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet
by putting  the accounting records in proper order, called conversion
method.
11.3.1 Preparing Statement of Affairs
Under this method, statements of assets and liabilities as at the beginning and
at the end of the relevant accounting period are prepared to ascertain the amount
of change in the capital during the period. Such a statement is known as
statement of affairs, shows assets on one side and the liabilities on the other just
as in case of a balance sheet. The difference between the totals of the two sides
(balancing figure) is the capital (refer figure 11.1). Though statement of affairs
resembles balance sheet, it is not called a balance sheet because the data is not
wholly based on ledger balances. The amounts of items like fixed assets,
outstanding expenses, bank balances, etc. are ascertained from the relevant
documents and physical count.

Fig. 11.1 : Format of statement of affairs
Once the amount of capital, both at the beginning and at the end is
computed with the help of statement of affairs, a statement of profit and loss
is prepared to ascertain the exact amount of profit or loss made during the
year. The difference between the opening and closing capital represents its
increase or decrease which is to be adjusted for withdrawals made by the
owner or any fresh capital introduced by him during the accounting period in
order to arrive at the amount of profit or loss made during the period.
The statement of profit and loss is prepared as shown in figure 11.2.

Accounts from Incomplete Records
If the net result of above computation is a positive amount, it represents
the profit earned during the year. In case the net result is a negative amount,
it would represent the loss sustained during the year. The same computation
can be done in the form of an equation as follows :
Profit or Loss = Capital at end – Capital at beginning + Drawings during the
year – Capital introduced during the year.
For example, consider the following information extracted from the records of Ms. Sheetu :
Capital at the beginning of year, i.e. April 01,2004
1,20,000
Capital at the end of year, i.e. on March 31,2005
2,00,000
Capital brought in by the proprietor during the year
50,000
Withdrawals by the proprietor during the year
30,000
The profit for the year will be calculated as follows :
The profit earned or loss incurred during a given period will be computed as follows :

11.3.2 Difference between Statement of Affairs and Balance Sheet
Both statement of affairs and balance sheet show the assets and liabilities of a
business entity on a particular date. However, there are some fundamental
differences between the two. A statement of affairs is prepared from incomplete
records where most of the assets are recorded on the basis of estimates  as
compared to a balance sheet which is prepared from records maintained on the
basis of double entry book-keeping and all assets and liabilities can be verified
from the ledger accounts. Hence, a balance sheet is more reliable than a statement
of affairs. The objective of preparing a statement of affairs is to ascertain the
amount of capital account as on that date whereas a balance sheet is prepared
to know the financial position of the business at a particular date. In statement
of affairs, an item of assets or liabilities may get omitted and this omission may
remain unknown because the effect of this omission gets adjusted in the capital
account balance and the total of both sides of statement match. However, in case
of a balance sheet the possibility of omission of any item is remote because in
case of an omission, the balance sheet will not agree and the accountant will
trace the missing item from accounting records. These differences have been
shown in a tabular form as under :

Do It Yourself
Identify a small shopkeeper in your locality, ask him about the accounting
records maintained by him. If he is not maintaining the records as per
double entry system, list the reasons thereof and ask him how does he
compute profit or loss.
11.4 Preparing Trading and Profit and Loss Account and
the Balance Sheet
To prepare proper trading and profit and loss account and the balance sheet
one needs complete information regarding expenses, incomes, assets and
liabilities. In case of incomplete records, details of some items like creditors,
cash purchases, debtors, cash sales, other cash payments and such receipts
are easily available, but there are a number of items the details of which will
have to be ascertained in an indirect manner by using the logic of double
entry. The most common items that are missing and have to be worked out as
such are :
Opening capital
Credit purchases
Credit sales
Bills payable accepted
Bills receivable received
Payments to creditors
Payments to debtors
Any other cash/bank related items.
You know that opening capital can be worked out by preparing the
statement of affairs at the beginning of the year. For other items we have
explained as to how available information can be used to ascertain their missing
figures with the help of total debtors and total creditors, total bills receivable
and total bills payable accounts and summary of cash.
11.4.1 Ascertaining Credit Purchases
The credit purchases figure is not usually available from the incomplete records.
It is quite possible that some other information related to  creditors may also
be missing. Therefore, by preparing the total creditors account, a proforma of
which is given in figure 11.4, credit purchases or any other missing figure
related to creditors, as the case may be, can be ascertained as the balancing
figure.

The figure of credit sales is also not usually available from incomplete records.
Some other information on related to debtors may also be missing. Therefore, if
the total debtors account is prepared as shown in figure 11.5, credit sales or any
other missing figure, as the case may be, can be traced out as the balancing
figure.

11.4.3 Ascertainment of Bills Receivable and Bills payable
Quite often, while all details relating to bills receivable and bills payable are
available but the figures of the bills received and bills accepted during the
year are not given. In such a situation, total bills receivable account and total
bills payable account can be prepared and the missing figures ascertained as
the balancing figures. The proforma of total bills receivable account and total
bills payable account is shown in figure 11.6 and  figure 11.7.

11.4.4 Ascertainment of Missing Information through Summary of Cash
Sometimes, the amount paid to creditors or the amount received from debtors
or the opening or closing cash or bank balance may be missing. To ascertain
any missing item of receipt or payment, we may prepare a cash book summary
showing all receipts and payments during the year and the balancing figure is
taken as the amount of missing item.
If however, both amount paid to creditors and that received from debtors
are missing, then any one of these may be obtained first through the total
creditors or total debtors account, as the case may be, and the other missing
information ascertained from the cash book summary in the same way as
stated earlier.
After the missing figures have been traced out, the final accounts may be
prepared straight away or after the preparation of the trial balance. The
components of the trial balance and their sources of information are
summarised below :
1. Closing assets (except stock) and

Solution
Cash sales and cash purchases are available from cash transactions. Credit purchase is
also given. But credit sale is to be ascertained by the opening debtors account. Though the
credit purchase is available, the closing balance of creditors is not known. That is why the
creditors account also has to be opened. As there are bills payable and bills receivable,
those accounts also have to be opened, otherwise the creditors and debtors accounts will
not be complete.

Incomplete records
Statement of affairs
Summary with Reference to Learning Objectives
Incomplete records : Incomplete records refer to, lack of accounting records
according to the double entry system. Degree of incompleteness may vary from
highly disorganised records to organised, but still not complete.
Difference between statement of affairs and balance sheet : A statement of affairs
is a statement showing various assets and liabilities of a firm on date, with
Accountancy
difference between the two sides denoting capital. Since, the records are
incomplete, the values of assets and liabilities are normally estimates based on
information available. They are not the balances taken from properly maintained
ledger like in case of balance sheet. The balance sheet is derived from a set of
books maintained on the basis of double entry system.
Computation of profit and loss from incomplete records : The statement of affairs
is used to compute capital when a firm has a highly disorganised set of incomplete
records. To the difference between the closing and opening capital, any sum
withdrawn from business are added back and any additional capital introduced
during the year are deducted to find out profit and loss made for the period.
Preparation of profit and loss account and balance sheet : When cash summary
of a firm is available along with information about personal accounts of creditors
and customers, an attempt can be made to prepare the profit and loss account
and balance sheet. Missing figures about purchases, sales, debtors and creditors
can be obtained by preparing proforma accounts of debtors, creditors, bills
receivable and bills payable using the logic of double entry system. Once a
profit and loss account and balance sheet are prepared, it will be possible for
the firm to start a complete accounting system for future.

Applications of Computers in Accounting
omputer technology and its usage have
registered a significant development during the
last three decades. Historically, computers have
been used effectively in science and technology to
solve the complex computational and logical
problems. They have also been used for carrying
out economic planning and forecasting processes.
Recently, modern day computers have made their
presence felt in business and industry. The most
important impact of computers has been on the
manner in which data is stored and processed
within an organisation. Although manual data
processing for Management Information System
(MIS) has been quite common in the past, modern
MIS would be nearly impossible without the use of
computer systems. In this chapter we shall discuss
the need for the use of computers in accounting,
the nature of accounting information system and
the types of accounting related MIS reports.
12.1 Meaning and Elements of Computer System
A computer is an electronic device, which is capable
of performing a variety of operations as directed by
a set of instructions. This set of instructions is called
a computer programme. A computer system is a
combination of six elements:
12.1.1 Hardware
Hardware of computer consists of physical components
such as keyboard, mouse, monitor and processor. These
are electronic and electromechanical components.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

interface
between
information systems.
Accountancy
12.1.2 Software
A set(s) of programmes, which is used to work with such hardware  is called
its software. A coded set of instructions stored in the form of circuits is called
firmware. There are six types of software as follows:
Operating System : An integrated set of specialised programmes that
are meant to manage the resources of a computer and also facilitate its
operation is called operating system. It creates a necessary interface
that is an interactive link, between the user and the computer hardware.
Utility Programmes : These are a set of computer programmes, which are
designed to perform certain supporting operations: such as programme
to format a disk, duplicate a disk, physically reorganise stored data and
programmes.
Application Software : These are user oriented programmes designed
and developed for performing certain specified tasks: such as payroll
accounting, inventory accounting, financial accounting, etc.
Language Processors : These are the software, which check for language
syntax and eventually translate (or interpret) the source programme
(that is a programme written in a computer language) into machine
language (that is the language which the computer understands).
System Software : These are a set of programmes which control such
internal functions as reading data from input devices, transmitting
processed data to output devices and also checking the system to ensure
that its components are functioning properly.
Connectivity Software : These are a set of programmes which create and
control a connection between a computer and a server so that the
computer is able to communicate and share the resources of  server
and other connected computers.
12.1.3 People
People interacting with the computers are also called live-ware of the computer
system. They constitute the most important part of the computer system :
System Analysts are the people who design data processing systems.
Programmers are the people who write programmes to implement the data
processing system design.
Operators are the people who participate in operating the computers.
People who respond to the procedures instituted for executing the computer
programmes are also a part of live-ware.
12.1.4 Procedures
The procedure means a series of operations in a certain order or manner to
achieve desired results. There are three types of procedures which constitute
Applications of Computers in Accounting
part of computer system: hardware-oriented, software-oriented and internal
procedure. Hardware–oriented procedure provide details about components
and their method of operation. The software-oriented procedure provides a
set of instructions required for using the software of computer system. Internal
procedure is instituted to ensure smooth flow of data to computers by
sequencing the operation of each sub-system of overall computer system.
12.1.5 Data
These are facts and may consist of numbers, text, etc. These are gathered
and entered into a computer system. The computer system in turn stores,
retrieves, classifies, organises and synthesises the data to produce information
according to a pre-determined set of instructions. The data is, therefore,
processed and organised to create information that is relevant and can be
used for decision-making.
12.1.6 Connectivity
It is being acknowledged as a sixth element of the computer system. The
manner in which a particular computer system is connected to others say
through telephone lines, microwave transmission, satellite link, etc. is the
element of connectivity.
12.2 Capabilities of Computer System
A computer system possesses some characteristics, which, in comparison to
human beings, turn out to be its capabilities. These are as follows ;
Speed : It refers to the amount of time computers takes in accomplishing a
task or completes an operation. Computers require far less time than human
beings in performing a task. Normally, human beings take into account a
second or minute as unit of time. But computers have such a fast operating
capability that the relevant unit of time is fraction of a second. Most of the
modern computers are capable of performing a 100 million calculations per
second and that is why the industry has developed Million Instructions per
Second (MIPS) as the criterion to classify different computers according to
speed.
Accuracy : It refers to the degree of exactness with which computations are
made and operations are performed. One might spend years in detecting errors
in computer calculations or updating a wrong record. Most of the errors in
Computer Based Information System(CBIS) occur because of bad programming,
erroneous data and deviation from procedures. These errors are caused by human
beings. Errors attributable to hardware are normally detected and corrected by
the computer system itself. The computers rarely commit errors and perform all
types of complex operations accurately.
Accountancy
Reliability : It refers to the ability with which the computers remain functional to
serve the user. Computers systems are well-adapted to performing repetitive
operations. They are immune to tiredness, boredom or fatigue. Therefore, they are
more reliable than human beings. Yet there can be failures of computer system
due to internal and external reasons. Any failure of the computer in a highly
automated industry is unacceptable. Therefore, the companies in such situations
provide for back-up facility to swiftly take over operations without loss of time.
Versatility : It refers to the ability of computers to perform a variety of tasks: simple
as well as complex. Computers are usually versatile unless designed for a specific
application. A general purpose computer is capable of being used in any area of
application: business, industry, scientific, statistical, technological, communications
and so on. A general purpose computer, when installed in an organisation, can
take over the jobs of several specialists because of its versatility.  computer system
when installed can take over the jobs of all these specialists because of being highly
versatile. This further ensures fuller utilisation of its capability.
Storage : It refers to the amount of data a computer system can store and
access. The computer systems, besides having instant access to data, have
huge capacity to store such data in a very small physical space. A CD-ROM
with 4.7” of diameter is capable of storing a large number of books, each
containing thousands of pages and yet leave enough space for storing more
such material. A typical mainframe computer system is capable of storing
and providing online billion of characters and thousands of graphic images.
It is clear from the above discussion that computer capabilities outperform
the human capabilities. As a result, a computer, when used properly, will
improve the efficiency of an organisation.
12.3 Limitations of a Computer System
In spite of possessing all the above capabilities, computers suffer from the
following limitations :
Lack of Commonsense : Computer systems as on date do not possess any
common sense because no full-proof algorithm has been designed to
programme common sense. Since computers work according to a stored
programme(s), they simply lack of commonsense.
Zero IQ : Computers are dumb devices with zero Intelligence Quotient (IQ).
They cannot visualise and think what exactly to do under a particular situation,
unless they have been programmed to tackle that situation. Computers must
be directed to perform each and every action, however, minute it may be.
Lack of Decision-making : Decision-making is a complex process involving
information, knowledge, intelligence, wisdom and ability to judge.  Computers
cannot take decisions on their own because they do not possess all the
essentials of decision-making. They can be programmed to take such decisions,
Applications of Computers in Accounting
which are purely procedure-oriented. If a computer has not been programmed
for a particular decision situation, it will not take decision due to lack of
wisdom and evaluating faculties. Human beings, on the other hand, possess
this great power of decision-making.
12.4 Components of Computer
The functional components of computer system consist of Input Unit, Central
Processing System and  Output Unit. The way these components are embedded
in a computer may differ from one architectural design to another, yet all of
them constitute the essential building blocks of a computer system.
Diagrammatically, these components may be presented as follows:
Fig. 12.1 : Block diagram of main components of computer
12.4.1 Input Unit
It controls various input devices which are used for entering data into the
computer system.  Keyboard and mouse, for instance, are  the most commonly
used input device. Other such devices are magnetic tape, magnetic disk, light
pen, optical scanner, Magnetic Ink Character (MICR) Recognition, Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), bar code reader, smart card reader, etc. Besides,
there are other devices which respond to voice and physical touch. A menu
layout is displayed on a touch sensitive screen. Whenever user touches a menu
item on touch-screen, the computer senses which particular menu item has
been touched and accordingly performs the operation associated with that menu
item. Such  touch screens have been installed at major railway stations for
obtaining the online information about arrival and departure of trains.
Accountancy
12.4.2 Central Processing Unit (CPU)
This is the main part of computer hardware that actually processes data,
according to the instructions it receives. It controls the flow of data by directing
the data to enter the system, places the data into its memory, retrieves the
same as and when needed and directs the output of data according to a set of
stored instructions. It has three main units as described below :
(a) Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) : It is responsible for performing all the
arithmetic computations such as addition, subtraction, division,
multiplication and exponentiation. In addition to this, it also performs
logical operations involving comparisons among variables and data items.
(b) Memory Unit : In this unit, data is stored before being actually processed.
The data so stored is accessed and processed according to a set of
instructions which are also stored in the memory of the computer well
before such data is transmitted to the memory from input devices.
(c) Control Unit : This unit is entrusted with the responsibility of controlling
and coordinating the activities of all other units of the computer system.
Specifically, it performs the following functions :
Read instructions out of memory unit;
Decode such instructions;
Set up the routing of data, through internal circuitry/wiring, to the
desired place at right time; and
Determine the input device from where to get next instruction after
the instruction in hand has been executed.
12.4.3 Output Unit
After processing the data, the information produced according to a set of
instruction need to be made available to user in a human readable and
understandable form. A computer system, therefore, needs an output device
to communicate such information to the user. Essentially, the output device
is assigned the task of translating the processed data from  machine coded
form to a human readable form. The commonly used output devices include:
external devices like monitor also called Visual Display Unit (VDU), printer,
graphic plotter for producing graphs, technical drawings and charts and
internal devices like magnetic storage devices. Recently, a new device being
perfected is the speech synthesiser, which is capable of producing verbal output
that sounds like human speech. Information:
12.5 Evolution of Computerised Accounting
Manual system of accounting has been traditionally the most popular method
of keeping the records of financial transactions of an organisation.
Applications of Computers in Accounting
Conventionally, the bookkeeper (or accountant) used to maintain books of
accounts such as cash book, journal and ledger so as to prepare a summary
of transactions and final accounts manually. The technological innovations
led to the development of various machines capable of performing a variety of
accounting functions. For example, the popular billing machine was designed
to typewrite description of the transaction along with names, addresses of
customers. This machine was capable of computing discounts; adding the
net total and posting the requisite data to the relevant accounts. The customer’s
bill was generated automatically once the operator has entered the necessary
information. These machines combined the features of a typewriter and various
kinds of calculators.
With substantial increase in the number of transactions, the technology
advanced further. With exponential increase in speed, storage and processing
capacity, newer versions of these machines evolved. A computer to which
they were connected operated these machines. The success of a growing
organisation with complexity of transactions tended to depend on resource
optimisation, quick decision-making and control. As a result, the maintenance
of accounting data on a real-time (or spontaneous) basis became almost
essential. Such a system of maintaining accounting records became convenient
with the computerised accounting system.
12.5.1 Information and Decisions
An organisation is a collection of interdependent decision-making units that
exist to pursue organisational objectives. As a system, every organisation
accepts inputs and transforms them into outputs. All organisational systems
pursue certain objectives through a process of resource allocation, which is
accomplished through the process of managerial decision-making. Information
facilitates decisions regarding allocation of resources and thereby assists an
organisation in pursuit of its objectives. Therefore, the information is the
most important organisational resource. Every medium sized to large
organisation has a well-established information system that is meant to
generate the information required for decision-making.
With the increasing use of information systems in organisations,
Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) have started playing a vital role in
supporting business operations. Every transaction processing system has
three components: Input, Processing and Output. Since Information
Technology (IT) follows the GIGO principle (Garbage in-Garbage out), it is
necessary that input to the IT-based information system is accurate, complete
and authorised. This is achieved by automating the input. A large number of
devices are now available to automate the input process for a TPS.
Accountancy
12.5.2 Transaction Processing System
Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) are among the earliest computerised
systems catering to the requirements of large business enterprises. The purpose
of a typical TPS is to record, process, validate and store transactions that
occur in the various functional areas of a business for subsequent retrieval
and usage. A transaction could be internal or external. When a department
requisitions material supplies from stores, an internal transaction is said to
have occurred. However, when the purchase department purchases materials
from a supplier, an external transaction takes place. The scope of financial
accounting is confined to external transactions only. TPS involves following
steps in processing a transaction. In order to understand these steps, let us
consider a case wherein a customer withdraws money using the Automated
Teller Machine (ATM) facility, as described below :
Data Entry : The action data must be entered into the system before it is
processed. There are a number of input devices to enter data: Keyboard,
mouse, etc. For example, a bank customer operates an ATM facility to make
a withdrawal. The actions taken by the customer constitute data, which is
processed after validation by the computerised personal banking system.
Data Validation : It ensures the accuracy and reliability of input data by
comparing the same with some predetermined standards or known data.
This validation is performed by error detection and error correction
procedures. The control mechanism, wherein actual input is compared
with the standard, is meant to detect errors while error correction
procedures make suggestions for entering correct data input. The Personal
Identification Number (PIN) of the customer is validated with the known
data. If it is incorrect, a suggestion is made to indicate that the PIN is
invalid. After validating the PIN (which is also a part of processing by TPS),
the amount of withdrawal being made by the customer is also checked to
ensure that it does not exceed a certain limit.
Processing and Revalidation : The processing of data, representing actions
of the ATM user, occurs almost instantaneously in case of the Online
Transaction Processing (OLTP) system provided a valid data representing
actions of the user has been encountered. This is called check input validity.
Revalidation occurs to ensure that the transaction in terms of delivery of
money by ATM has been completed. This is called check output validity.
Storage : Processed actions, as described above, culminate into financial
transaction data, which describe the withdrawal of money by a particular
customer, are stored in transaction database of Computerised personal banking
system. This implies that only valid transactions are stored in the database.
Information : The stored data is processed using the query facility to produce
desired information. A database supported by DBMS is bound to have
standard Structured Query Language (SQL) support.
Applications of Computers in Accounting
Reporting : Finally, reports can be prepared on the basis of the required
information content according to decision usefulness of report.
A simple computerised accounting system accepts the complete transaction
data as input; stores such data in computer storage media (say hard disk)
and retrieves the accounting data for processing as and when required for
generating an accounting report, as output. The input-process-output diagram
shown below indicates as to how accounting software translates data into
information. This processing of data is accomplished either through Batch
Processing or Real-time Processing.
Batch Processing applies to large and voluminous data that is accumulated
offline from various units: branches or departments. The entire accumulated
data is processed in one shot to generate the desired reports according to
decision requirement.
Real-Time Processing provides online outcome in the form of information
and reports without time lag between the transaction and its processing. The
accounting reports are generated by query language popularly called Structured
Query Language (SQL).  It allows the user to retrieve report relevant information
that is capable of being laid out in pre-designed accounting report.
Accounting software may be structured with such components as provide for
storage and processing of data pertaining to purchase, sales, inventory, payroll
and other financial transactions (refer figure 12.2).
Do It Yourself
Go to a departmental store and an ATM of a Bank and identify the
accounting process there. Observe the Transaction Processing System (TPS).
12.6 Features of Computerised Accounting System
Accounting software is used to implement a computerised accounting system.
The computer accounting system is based on the concept of databases. It
does away with the concept of creating and maintaining journals, ledger, etc.
which are essential while working with manual accounting system. Typicaly
computerised accounting system offers the following features :
Online input and storage of accounting data.
Printout of purchase and sales invoices.
Logical scheme for codification of accounts and transactions. Every account
and transaction is assigned a unique code.
Grouping of accounts is done from the very beginning.
Instant reports for management, for example – Aging Statement, Stock
Statement, Trial Balance, Trading and Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet,
Stock Valuation, Value Added Tax (VAT), Returns, Payroll Report, etc.

12.7 Management Information System and Accounting
Information System
In order to remain competitive, organisations depend heavily on Information
Systems. Management Information System (MIS) is used the most common
form of information system. A management information system (MIS) is a
system that provides the information necessary to take decisions and manage
an organisation effectively. MIS is supportive of the institution’s long-term
strategic goals and objectives. MIS is viewed and used at many levels by
management:  Operational, Tactical and Strategic. Accounting Information
System (AIS) identifies, collects, processes, and communicates economic
information about an entity to a wide variety of users. Such information is
organised in a manner that correct decisions can be based on it.
Every accounting system is essentially a part of the Accounting Information
System (AIS) which, in turn is a part of the broader system, viz. the
organisation’s Management Information System.
The following diagram shows the relationship of the Accounting System
with the other functional management information systems.
Fig. 12.3 : Relationship of the accounting system with other
functional management information system
The diagram shown above entails the four widely recognised functional
areas of management. An organisation operates in a given environment
surrounded by the suppliers and customers. The informational needs
emerge from the business processes stratified into functional areas where
accounting is one of them. The accounting information system (AIS) receives
and provides information to the various sub-systems of the institutional/
integrated MIS.
Accountancy
Accounting Information System (AIS) is a collection of resources (people
and equipment), designed to transform financial and other data into
information. This information is communicated to a wide variety of decision-
makers. Accepting information systems performs this transformation whether
they are essentially manual systems or thoroughly computerised.
Conventionally, MIS was also perceived as day-to-day financial accounting
systems that are used to ensure basic control is maintained over financial
record keeping activities, but now it is widely recognised as a broader concept
and accounting system is a sub component.
The reports generated by the accounting system are disseminated to
the various users – internal and external to the organisation. The external
parties include the proprietors, investors, creditors, financiers, government
suppliers and vendors and the society at large. The reports used by these
parties are more of routine nature. However, the internal parties – the
employees, managers, etc. use the accounting information for decision-
making and control.
Do It Yourself
Go to a shoe manufacturing unit/chemical-processing unit. Observe the
production process and the various selling activities. Visualise the need
for a MIS. Identify the various sub components of the MIS.
12.7.1 Designing of Accounting Reports
Data when processed becomes information. When the related information is
summarised to meet a particular need, it is called as a report.  The content
and design of the report is expected to vary depending upon the level to which
it is submitted and decision to made on the basis of the report. A report must
be effective and efficient to the user and should substantiate the decision-
making process. Akin to any report, every accounting report must be able to
fulfil the following criterion :
(a) Relevance
(b) Timeliness
(c) Accuracy
(d) Completeness
(e) Summarisation
The accounting reports generated by the accounting software may be either
routine reports or on the specific requirements of the user. For example, the
ledger is a routine report while a report on supplies of a particular item by a
given party is an on-demand report. However, from a broader perspective, the
accounting related MIS reports may be of following reports :
Applications of Computers in Accounting
(a) Summary Reports : Summarises all activities of the organisation and present
in the form of summary report. Profit and Loss account and Balance Sheet.
(b) Demand Reports : This report will be prepared only when the management
requests them, e.g. Bad Debts Report for a given product, Stock Valuation
Report.
(c) Customer/Supplier Reports : According to the specifications of the
management it will be prepared. For example, Top 10 Customers report,
Interest on Customer Account/Invoices, Statement of Account, Customer
Reminder Letters Outstanding/Open Delivery Order, Purchase Analysis,
Vendor Analysis report.
(d) Exception Reports : According to the conditions or exceptions the report
is prepared. For example, Inventory Report in short supplies, Stock Status
Query, Over stocked Status, etc.
(e) Responsibility Reports : The MIS structure specifies the premises of
management responsibilities. For example, the report on Cash Position,
to be submitted by the head of Finance and Accounts department.
The various steps involved in designing accounting reports from accounting
data are as follows :
(1) Definition of objectives : the objectives of the report must be clearly
defined, who are the users of the report and the decision to be taken on
the basis of report.
(2) Structure of the report : the information to be contained therein and the
style of presentation.
(3) Querying with the database : the accounting information queries must
be clearly defined and the methodology to be adopted while interacting
with the database.
(4) Finalising the report.
12.7.2 Data Interface between the Information System
Accounting information system is important component of the organisational
MIS in an organisation. It receives information and provides information to
the other functional MIS.  The following examples illustrate the relationship
and data interface between the various sub-components of MIS.
Accounting Information System, Manufacturing Information System and
Human Resource Information System
Look at figure 12.4. It depicts the relationship between the three information
systems, viz. manufacturing information system, accounting information
system and the human resource information system.
Accountancy
The manufacturing department receives the list of workers from the Human
Resource (HR) department. It sends the details of production achieved by the
workers on the basis of which the HR department to the finance and accounts
(F&A) department to pay the wages. The details of the wages paid and statutory
dues are also send by the F & A department to the production department
also to the HR department to monitor the performance of workers. The HR
department communicates to the other departments about the good/bad
performance on the basis decision on various operational matters may be
taken.
Fig. 12.4 : Relationship between AIS, manufacturing information
system and human resource information system
AIS and Marketing Information System
Consider the business process in the Marketing and Sales department involving
the following activities :
inquiry
contact creation
entry of orders
dispatch of goods
billing to customers
The accounting sub-system’s transaction cycle include the processing of
sales orders, credit authorisation, custody of the goods, inventory position,
shipping information, receivables, etc. It also keeps a track of the customer
accounts, e.g. Aging Report, which should be generated by the system.
Applications of Computers in Accounting
AIS and Manufacturing Information System
Similarly, business process in the production department may involve the
following activities :
preparation of plans and schedules
issue of material requisition forms and job cards
issue of inventory
issue of orders for procurement of raw materials
handling of vendors invoices
payments to vendors
The accounting sub-system transaction cycle would therefore include the
processing of purchase orders, advance to suppliers/vendors, inventory status
updation, account payable, etc. All of this information has to share with the
other MIS in the organisation.
Hence, the computerised accounting system as a sub component of the
accounting information system transforms the financial data into meaningful
information and communicates the information to the decision-makers. The
report demanded may be routine or specific ones.

Computerised Accounting System
n chapter 12, you have learnt about the need for
use of computers in accounting the nature and
use of accounting information system. In this
chapter, we shall discuss the nature of computrised
accounting system, its advantages, limitations and
sourcing.
13.1 Concept of Computerised
Accounting System
A computerised accounting system is an accounting
information system that processes the financial
transactions and events as per Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) to produce reports as
per user requirements. Every accounting system,
manual or computerised, has two aspects. First, it
has to work under a set of well-defined concepts
called accounting principles. Another, that there is
a user-defined framework for maintenance of
records and generation of reports.
In a computerised accounting system, the framework
of storage and processing of data is called operating
environment that consists of hardware as well as software
in which the accounting system, works. The type of the
accounting system used determines the operating
environment. Both hardware and software are
interdependent. The type of software determines the
structure of the hardware. Further, the selection of
hardware is dependent upon various factors such as
the number of users, level of secrecy and the nature of
various activities of functional departments in an
organisation.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this
chapter, you will be able
define a computerised
accounting system;
distinguish between a
manual and computer-
ised accounting sys-
highlight the advanta-
ges and limitations of
computerised account-
ing system; and
state the sourcing of a
computerised account-
ing system.
Computerised Accounting System
Take the case of a club,  for example, where the number of transactions
and their variety is relatively small, a Personal Computer with standardised
software may be sufficient. However, for a large business organisation with a
number of geographically scattered factories and offices, more powerful
computer systems supported by sophisticated networks are required to handle
the voluminous data and the complex reporting requirements. In order to
handle such requirements, multi-user operating systems such as UNIX, Linux,
etc. are used.
Modern computerised accounting systems are based on the concept of
database. A database is implemented using a database management system,
which is define by a set of computer programmes (or software) that manage
and organise data effectively and provide access to the stored data by the
application programmes. The accounting database is well-organised with active
interface that uses accounting application programs and reporting system.
Every computerised accounting system has two basic requirements;
Accounting Framework  : It consists a set of principles, coding and grouping
structure of accounting.
Operating Procedure : It is a well-defined operating procedure blended
suitably with the operating environment of the organisation.
The use of computers in any database oriented application has four basic
requirements as mentioned below ;
Front-end Interface : It is an interactive link or a dialog between the user
and database-oriented software through which the user communicates to
the back-end database. For example, a transaction relating to purchase
of goods may be dealt with the accounting system through a purchase
voucher, which appears on the computer’s monitor of data entry operator
and when entered into the system is stored in the database. The same
data may be queried through reporting system say purchase analysis
software programme.
Back-end Database : It is the data storage system that is hidden from the
user and responds to the requirement of the user to the extent the user is
authorised to access.
Data Processing : It is a sequence of actions that are taken to transform
the data into decision useful information.
Reporting System: It is an integrated set of objects that constitute the
report.
The computerised accounting is also one of the database-oriented
applications wherein the transaction data is stored in well-organised database.
The user operates on such database using the required and desired interface
and also takes the desired reports by suitable transformations of stored data
into information. Therefore, the fundamentals of computerised accounting
Accountancy
embrace all the basic requirements of any database-oriented application in
computers. Accordingly, the computerised accounting system has the above
four additional requirements.
13.2 Comparison between Manual and Computerised Accounting
Accounting, by definition, is the process of identifying, recording, classifying
and summarising financial transactions to produce the financial reports for
their ultimate analysis. Let us understand these activities in the context of
manual and computerised accounting system.
Identifying : The identification of transactions, based on application of
accounting principles is, common to both manual and computerised
accounting system.
Recording : The recording of financial transactions, in manual accounting
system is through books of original entries while the data content of such
transactions is stored in a well-designed accounting database in
computerised accounting system.
Classification : In a manual accounting system, transactions recorded in
the books of original entry are further classified by posting into ledger
accounts. This results in transaction data duplicity.  In computerised
accounting, no such data duplication is made to cause classification of
transactions. In order to produce ledger accounts, the stored transaction
data is processed to appear as classified so that the same is presented in
the form of a report. Different forms of the same transaction data are
made available for being presented in various reports.
Summarising : The transactions are summarised to produce trial balance
in manual accounting system by ascertaining the balances of various
accounts. As a result, preparation of ledger accounts becomes a pre-
requisite for preparing the trial balance. However, in computerised
accounting, the originally stored transactions data are processed to churn
out the list of balances of various accounts to be finally shown in the trial
balance report. The generation of ledger accounts is not a necessary
condition for producing trial balance in a computerised accounting system.
Adjusting Entries : In a manual accounting system, these entries are made
to adhere to the principle of cost matching revenue. These entries are
recorded to match the expenses of the accounting period with the revenues
generated by them. Some other adjusting entries may be made as part of
errors and rectification. However, in computerised accounting, Journal
vouchers are prepared and stored to follow the principle of cost matching
revenue, but there is nothing like passing adjusting entries for errors and
rectification, except for rectifying an error of principle by having recorded
a wrong voucher such as using payment voucher for a receipt transaction.
Computerised Accounting System
Financial Statements : In a manual system of accounting, the preparation
of financial statements pre-supposes the availability of trial balance.
However, in computerised accounting, there is no such requirement. The
generation of financial statements is independent of producing the trial
balance because such statements can be prepared by direct processing of
originally stored transaction data.
Closing the Books : After the preparation of financial reports, the accountants
make preparations for the next accounting period. This is achieved by
posting of closing and reversing journal entries. In computerised accounting,
there is year-end processing to create and store opening balances of accounts
in database.
It may be observed that conceptually, the accounting process is identical
regardless of the technology used.
13.3 Advantages of Computerised Accounting System
Computerised accounting offers several advantages vis-a-vis manual accounting,
these are summarised as follows ;
Speed : Accounting data is processed faster by using a computerised
accounting system than it is achieved through manual efforts. This is because
computers require far less time than human beings in performing a task.
Accuracy : The possibility of error is eliminated in a computerised
accounting system because the primary accounting data is entered once
for all the subsequent usage and processes in preparing the accounting
reports. Normally, accounting errors in a manual accounting system occur
because of repeated posting of same set of original data by several times
while preparing different types of accounting reports.
Reliability : The computer system is well-adapted to performing repetitive
operations. They are immune to tiredness, boredom or fatigue. As a result,
computers are highly reliable compared to human beings. Since computerised
accounting system relies heavily on computers, they are relatively more reliable
than manual accounting systems.
Up-to-Date Information : The accounting records, in a computerised
accounting system are updated automatically as and when accounting
data is entered and stored. Therefore, latest information pertaining to
accounts get reflected when accounting reports are produced and printed.
For example, when accounting data pertaining to a transaction
regarding cash purchase of goods is entered and stored, the cash account,
purchase account and also the final accounts (trading and profit and loss
account) reflect the impact immediately.
Accountancy
Real Time User Interface : Most of the automated accounting systems are
inter-linked through a network of computers. This facilitates the availability
of information to various users at the same time on a real time basis (that
is spontaneously).
Automated Document Production : Most of the computerised accounting
systems have standardised, user defined format of accounting reports that
are generated automatically. The accounting reports such as Cash book,
Trial balance, Statement of accounts are obtained just by click of a mouse
in a computerised accounting environment.
Scalability : In a computerised accounting system, the requirement of
additional manpower is confined to data entry operators for storing
additional vouchers. The additional cost of processing additional transactions
is almost negligible. As a result the computerised accounting systems are
highly scalable.
Legibility : The data displayed on computer monitor is legible. This is
because the characters (alphabets, numerals, etc.) are type written using
standard fonts. This helps in avoiding errors caused by untidy written
figures in a manual accounting system.
Efficiency : The computer based accounting systems ensure better use of
resources and time. This brings about efficiency in generating decisions,
useful informations and reports.
Quality Reports : The inbuilt checks and untouchable features of data
handling facilitate hygienic and true accounting reports that are highly
objective and can be relied upon.
MIS Reports : The computerised accounting system facilitates the real time
production of management information reports, which will help
management to monitor and control the business effectively. Debtors’
analysis would indicate the possibilities of defaults (or bad debts) and also
concentration of debt and its impact on the balance sheet. For example, if
the company has a policy of restricting the credit sales by a fixed amount
to a given party, the information is available on the computer system
immediately when every voucher is entered through the data entry form.
However, it takes time when it comes to a manual accounting system.
Besides, the results may not be accurate.
Storage and Retrieval : The computerised accounting system allows the
users to store data in a manner that does not require a large amount of
physical space. This is because the accounting data is stored in
hard-disks, CD-ROMs, floppies that occupy a fraction of physical space
compared to books of accounts in the form of ledger, journal and other
accounting registers. Besides, the system permits fast and accurate
retrieval of data and information.
Computerised Accounting System
Motivation and Employees Interest : The computer system requires a
specialised training of staff, which makes them feel more valued. This
motivates them to develop interest in the job. However, it may also cause
resistance when we switch over from a manual system to a computer
system.

13.4 Limitations of Computerised Accounting System
The main limitations emerge out of the environment in which the computerised
accounting system is made to operate. These limitations are as given below ;
Cost of Training : The sophisticated computerised accounting packages
generally require specialised staff personnel. As a result, a huge training
costs are incurred to understand the use of hardware and software on a
continuous basis because newer types of hardware and software are
acquired to ensure efficient and effective use of computerised accounting
systems.
Staff  Opposition : Whenever the accounting system is computerised, there
is a significant degree of resistance from the existing accounting staff,
partly because of the fear that they shall be made redundant and largely
because of the perception that they shall be less important to the
organisation.
Disruption : The accounting processes suffer a significant loss of work
time when an organisation switches over to the computerised accounting
system. This is due to changes in the working environment that requires
accounting staff to adapt to new systems and procedures.
System Failure : The danger of the system crashing due to hardware failures
and the subsequent loss of work is a serious limitation of computerised
accounting system. However, providing for back-up arrangements can
obviate this limitation. Software damage and failure may occur due to
attacks by viruses. This is of particular relevance to accounting systems
that extensively use Internet facility for their online operations. No full-
proof solutions are available as of now to tackle the menace of attacks on
software by viruses.
Accountancy
Inability to Check Unanticipated Errors : Since the computers lack capability
to judge, they cannot detect unanticipated errors as human beings commit.
This is because the software to detect and check errors is a set of
programmes for known and anticipated errors.
Breaches of Security : Computer related crimes are difficult to detect as
any alteration of data may go unnoticed. The alteration of records in a
manual accounting system is easily detected by first sight. Fraud and
embezzlement are usually committed on a computerised accounting system
by alteration of data or programmes. Hacking of passwords or user rights
may change the accounting records. This is achieved by tapping
telecommunications lines, wire-tapping or decoding of programmes. Also,
the people responsible for tampering of data cannot be located which in a
manual system is relatively easier to detect.
Ill-effects on Health : The extensive use of computers systems may
lead to development of various health problems: bad backs, eyestrain,
muscular pains, etc. This affects adversely the working efficiency of
accounting staff on one hand and increased medical expenditure on
such staff on the other.

Observe the various accounting activities. Now list the advantages, which
would have accrued, had the accounting being performed through
computers.
13.5 Sourcing of Accounting Software
Accounting software is an integral part of the computerised accounting
system. An important factor to be considered before acquiring accounting
software is the accounting expertise of people responsible in organisation
for accounting work. People, not computers, are responsible for accounting.
The need for accounting software arises in two situations : (a) when the
computerised accounting system is implemented to replace the manual
system or (b) when the current computerised system needs to be replaced
with a new one in view of changing needs.
Computerised Accounting System
Box 1
Accounting Software
Variety of accounting software is available in the market. The most
popular software used in India are Tally and Ex. The basic features of
all accounting software are same on a global basis. The legal reporting
requirements in a given country and the business needs affect the
software contents. The other popular softwares are Sage, Wings 2000,
Best Books, Cash Manager, and Ace Pays, etc.
13.5.1 Accounting Packages
Every Computerised Accounting System is implemented to perform the
accounting activity (recording and storing of accounting data) and generate
reports as per the requirements of the user. From this perspective.
The accounting packages are classified into the following categories :
Ready to use
Customised
Tailored
Each of these categories offers distinctive features. However, the choice of
the accounting software would depend upon the suitability to the organisation
especially in terms of accounting needs.
13.5.2 Ready-to-Use
Ready-to-Use accounting software is suited to organisations running small/
conventional business where the frequency or volume of accounting
transactions is very low. This is because the cost of installation is generally
low and number of users is limited. Ready-to-use software is relatively easier
to learn and people (accountant) adaptability is very high. This also implies
that level of secrecy is relatively low and the software is prone to data frauds.
The training needs are simple and sometimes the vendor (supplier of software)
offers the training on the software free. However, these software offer little
scope of linking to other information systems.
13.5.3 Customised
Accounting software may be customised to meet the special requirement of
the user. Standardised accounting software available in the market may not
suit or fulfil the user requirements. For example, standardised accounting
software may contain the sales voucher and inventory status as separate
options. However, when the user requires that inventory status to be updated
immediately upon entry of sales voucher and report be printed, the software
needs to be customised.
Accountancy
Customised software is suited large and medium businesses and can be
linked to the other information systems. The cost of installation and
maintenance is relatively high because the high cost is to be paid to the vendor
for customisation. The customisation includes modification and addition to
the software contents, provision for the specified number of users and their
authentication, etc. Secrecy of data and software can be better maintained in
customised software. Since the need to train the software users is important,
the training costs are therefore high.
13.5.4 Tailored
The accounting software is generally tailored in large business organisations
with multi users and geographically scattered locations. These software
requires specialised training to the users. The tailored software is designed to
meet the specific requirements of the users and form an important part of the
organisational MIS. The secrecy and authenticity checks are robust in such
softwares and they offer high flexibility in terms of number of users.
To summarise, the following table represents the comparison between the
various categories of accounting software :

Computerised Accounting System
13.6 Generic Considerations before Sourcing an Accounting Software
The following factors are usually taken in considerations before sourcing
an accounting software.
13.6.1 Flexibility
An important consideration before sourcing an accounting software is
flexibility, viz. data entry and the availability and design of various reports
expected from it. Also, it should offer some flexibility between the users of the
software, the switch over between the accountants (users), operating systems
and the hardware. The user should be able to run the software on variety of
platforms and machines, e.g. Windows 98/2000, Linux, etc.
13.6.2 Cost of Installation and Maintenance
The choice of the software obviously requires consideration of organisation ability
to afford the hardware and software. A simple guideline to take such a decision is
the cost benefit analysis of the available options and the financing opportunities
available to the firm. Some times, certain software which appears cheap to buy,
involve heavy maintenance and alteration costs, e.g. cost of addition of modules,
training of staff, updating of versions, data failure/restoring costs. Conversely, the
accounting software which appear initially expensive to buyers, may require least
maintenance and free upgrading and negligible alteration costs.
13.6.3 Size of Organisation
The size of organisation and the volume of business transactions do affect the
software choices. Small organisations, e.g. in non-profit organisations, where
the number of accounting transactions is not so large, may opt for a simple,
single user operated software. While, a large organisation may require
sophisticated software to meet the multi-user requirements, geographically
scattered and connected through complex networks.
13.6.4 Ease of Adaptation and Training needs
Some accounting software is user friendly requiring a simple training to the
users. However, some other complex software packages linked to other
information systems require intensive training on a continuous basis. The
software must be capable of attracting users and, if its requires simple training,
should be able to motivate its potential users.
13.6.5 Utilities/MIS Reports
The MIS reports and the degree to which they are used in the organisation
also determine the acquisition of software. For example, software that requires
Accountancy
simply producing the final accounts or cash flow/ratio analysis may be ready-
to-use software. However, the software, which is expected to produce cost
records needs to be customised as per user requirements.
13.6.6 Expected Level of Secrecy (Software and Data)
Another consideration before buying accounting software is the security
features, which prevent unauthorised personnel from accessing and/or
manipulating data in the accounting system. In tailored software for large
businesses, the user rights may be restricted to purchase vouchers for the
purchase department, sales vouchers to the billing accountants and petty
cash module access with the cashier. The operating system also matters.
Unix environment allows multi-users compared to Windows. In Unix, the user
cannot make the computer system functional unless the user clicks with a
password, which is not a restriction in Windows.
13.6.7 Exporting/Importing Data Facility
The transfer of database to other systems or software is sometimes expected
from the accounting software. Organisations may need to transfer information
directly from the ledger into spreadsheet software such as Lotus or Excel for
more flexible reporting. The software should allow the hygienic, untouched
data transfer.
Accounting software may be required to be linked to MIS software in the
organisation. In some ready to use accounting softwares, the exporting,
importing facility is available but is limited to MS Office modules only, e.g. MS
Word, MS Excel, etc. However, tailored softwares are designed in manner that
they can interact and share information with the various sub components of
the organisational MIS.
13.6.8 Vendors Reputation and Capability
Another important consideration is the reputation and capability of about
the vendor. This depends upon how long has he been the vendor is in business
of software development, whether there are other users of the software and
extent of the availability of support mechanisms outside the premises of the
vendor.

n the earlier chapters, you have already learnt
that accounting of transactions are documented
with vouchers. Let us consider a few accounting
transaction to understand as to how these vouchers
are used.
On April 01, 05 M/s Kshipra Computers
commences business with initial capital of
Rs.5,00,000, which is deposited into bank. Recall the
journal entry that is recorded using manual
accounting system. This journal entry has data
contents that are filled-up using a simple transaction
voucher, which is prepared by Smith and authorised
by Aditya.

The same transaction can also be documented using  a credit voucher that
is capable of recording multiple credits against one debit, as shown below:

Now consider the following transaction :
On April 03-20005 M/s Kshipra Computers bought goods costing Rs.50,000
from M/s R.S. and Sons, paying Rs.2,000 as cartage to M/s Saini Transports.
This transaction involves multiple debits of accounts with one account being
credited. The debit voucher that is used to document this transaction appears
as follows :

Accountancy
The process of computerised accounting involves identifying, storing and
retrieving the data content of an accounting transaction. This requires a
mechanism to store such data content of vouchers in a manner that allows its
easy and convenient retrieval as and when required. This is achieved by designing
suitable database for accounting. Such a database consists of inter-related data
tables that are structured in a manner that ensures data consistency and
integrity. In this chapter we shall discuss the basic concepts of database system
of accounting.
14.1 Data Processing Cycle
In order to understand the dynamics of database design, let us understand the
data processing cycle in the context of accounting. Data processing involves the
technique of collecting, sorting, relating, interpreting and computing data items
in such a manner as to provide meaningful and useful information for decision-
making. The necessary steps involved in data processing cycle are data capturing,
inputing, processing and generating information available to the user. Data
processing cycle, when thought of in the context of accounting, requires a series
of steps that have been described below briefly :
(i) Source Documents : The first step is to capture accounting data from
transaction(s) so as to prepare a document, called voucher (as already
stated earlier), that expresses and documents an accounting transaction.
The relevant accounting data is set out in the voucher, the sample of which
is shown in figures 14.1 to 14.3. These documents are so designed as to
permit the recording of accounting data in a systematic manner.
(ii) Input of Data : The accounting data contained in vouchers is to be entered
in a computer’s storage device. This is achieved by using a pre-designed
Data Entry Form. This data entry form is designed in a manner that it is
similar to physical voucher document. The data entry form is designed
using software and it is made to appear on the computer monitor so that
the data is entered.
(iii) Data Storage : A suitable data storage structure is required to provide for
a blank data record as shown below:
Structuring Database for Accounting
The above blank record that is used for storing the input of data pertaining
code of account, name of account and the category type to which it belongs
is shown below as :
11001
Capital Account
711001
Purchases Account
Hypothetically, the category type 4 above refers to Liabilities and the
category type 1 indicates Expenses. The data storage structures (also called
data tables) are created as a part of structuring database for accounting.
(iv) Manipulation of Data : The stored data is manipulated for necessary
transformation to generate final reports. Such transformed data may be
stored separately and subsequently used for generating final reports.
Alternatively, the transformed data can be directly presented in the form
of a report.
(v) Output of Data : The accounting reports such as ledger, trial balance, etc.
are obtained in a pre-designed format by accessing the transformed data.
Now that you have understood the way data content is stored in structured
manner, we shall discuss how the data structures are designed in consonance
with the data content that emerges from accounting transactions.
14.2 Designing Database for Accounting
Both computerised and computer-based AIS require a definite data structure
for storing the accounting data. As already mentioned, the databases are used
for storing accounting data. The process of designing database (for accounting)
begins with a reality (or accounting reality) that is expressed using elements of a
conceptual data model. The process of designing a database for accounting is
best described through a flow chart (Figure : 14.4).
Reality : It refers to some aspect of real world situation, for which database is to
be designed. In the context of accounting, it is accounting reality that is to be
expressed with complete description.
ER Design : This is a formal blue print, with a pictorial presentation, in which
Entity Relationship (ER) Model concepts are used to represent description of
reality.
Relational Data Model : It is representational data model through which ER
design is transformed into inter-related data tables along with the restriction in
the form of rules that are specified to ensure the consistency and integrity of
stored data.
Accountancy
Fig. 14.4 : Flow Chart depicting the process of designing a database for accounting
Normalisation : This is process of refining a database design (that consists of
inter-related data tables) through which the possibility of duplicate or redundant
data items is reduced or eliminated.
Refinement : This is the outcome of the process of normalisation as mentioned
above. The final database design is arrived at after the process of normalisation
is completed.
14.3 Entity Relationship (ER) Model
It is a popular conceptual data model, which is mostly used in database-oriented
applications. The major elements of ER Model are entities, attributes, identifiers
and relationships that are used to express a reality for which a database is to be
designed. The model is best depicted with the help of ER symbols, the list and
description of which is shown in figure 14.5. While preparing an ER Diagram,
the following symbols are used to represent different types of entities, attributes,
identifiers and relationships :

Accounting Reality Describing the System of Accounting
Using a hypothetical example of accounting system of an organisation, following
statements of reality becomes the starting point of discussion in describing the ER
Model concepts.
Example Reality :
Accounting Transactions of an organisation are documented using a voucher.
Each vouchers is assigned a serial number, which begins with “01” indicating first
vouchers of the accounting period. There is only one simple transaction voucher used
for documenting the transactions (See Figure : 14.1).
Each voucher documents date of transaction, account name along with its account
code for debit as well as credit entry.
Each voucher indicates the amount and narration with respect to accounting
transaction.
Support documents such as bills, receipts, contracts, etc. also may be attached to
an accounting voucher.
Each Voucher is prepared by a particular Employee and authorised by another
employee.
There is an exhaustive list of Accounts with respect to which the transactions are
documented. Each Account carries a unique numeric code with its width equal to six
digits.
Each Account is classified as belonging to one of the Accounts Types: Expenditure,
Income, Assets and Liabilities.
Fig. 14.6 : Example reality on accounting system
14.3.1 Entities
Anything in the real world with independent existence is called entity such as
an object with physical existence (e.g. car, person, house) or conceptual
existence (e.g. a company, job, university course, account, voucher). In the
context of above accounting reality, there exist five entities: Accounts, Vouchers,
Employees, AccountsType and SupportDocuments. The accounting data is
captured through these entities.
14.3.2 Attributes
Attributes are some properties of interest (or characteristics) that further describe
the entity such as height, weight and date of birth in case of a person and code
and name in case of accounts. An entity has a value for each of its attributes,
which is the data stored in the database.
There are several types of attributes of an entity that have been described as
follows :
(i) Composite vs. Simple (or atomic) attributes : The composite attributes
can be divided into smaller sub-parts to represent some more basic
Structuring Database for Accounting
attributes with independent meanings. The simple attributes cannot be
further sub-divided. For example, Name of a person that is normally sub-
divided into First Name, Middle Name and Last Name is a composite
attribute. Height of a person is a simple attribute as it is devoid of further
sub-division.
(ii) Single-valued vs. Multi-valued Attributes : An attribute with a single value
for an entity is single-valued as opposed to those which multiple values.
For example, height of a person is single-valued attribute while
qualifications of that person are a multi-valued attribute.
(iii) Stored vs. Derived Attributes : Two or more attributes may be related in
such a way that one or more becomes basic while the other becomes
dependent on that basic attribute. For example, date of birth of a person
is a stored attribute while age of that person is derived attribute.
(iv) Null Values : Absence of a data item is represented by a special value
called null value. There are three situation which may require the use of
null values
When a particular attribute does not apply to an entity;
Value of an attribute is unknown, although it exists;
Unknown because it does not exist.
(v) Complex Attributes : The composite and multi-valued attributes may be
nested (or grouped) to constitute complex ones. The parenthesis () are
used for showing grouping of components of composite attributes. The
braces {} are used for showing the multi-valued attributes
In the context of the example on accounting reality, the following attributes
specific to each entity types have been stated below as :
Entity Type
List of Attributes
AccountsType
CatId, Category
Accounts
Code, Name, Type
Employees
EmpId, Fname, Minit, Lname, SuperId
Vouchers
Vno, Date, Debit, Credit, Amount, Narration, AuthBy, PrepBy
SupportDocuments
Sno, dDate, Name
AccountsType is a conceptual entity that is meant to express the various
categories of accounts in accounting system. The CatId is an attribute of
AccountType entity, the value of which is used to identify the category of
accounts.
Accounts is a conceptual entity that is meant to express various accounts,
each one of which belongs to a particular category of accounts in Accounts
Type Entity. Every account is assigned a unique code by which it is
Accountancy
identified. The Name attribute specifies the name of account and Type
refers to the type of account (or category of account) as mentioned above.
Employees is a physical entity that is meant to express the various
employees who are in some way connected with the accounting system.
The EmpId (Employee ID) attribute is meant to identify an Employee;
Fname, Minit and Lname are respectively the first, middle and Last names
of an employee; and SuperId refers to EmpId of the immediate boss of an
employee.
Vouchers is an entity that expresses various transactions vouchers. It is
attributes together provide the structure of transaction data.
SupportDocuments is an entity, which expresses various support
documents that may be attached with a particular voucher of a transaction.
Sno attribute of this entity specifies the serial number of support document
attached, dDate specifies the document date and Name specifies the name
of document that is attached with the voucher.
(vi) Entity Types and Entity Sets : An Entity Type is defined as a collection
of entities, which share a common definition in terms of their attributes.
Each entity type is assigned a name for its subsequent identification. The
attributes of entity type are used to describe it in the database. The values
of attributes of an entity belonging to entity type are known as Entity
Instance. For example, (110001 Capital Account 4) is an entity instance
of an account whose code = 110001, Name = Capital Account and Type =
4. An Entity Set is a collection of all entity instances of a particular entity
type.  An Entity Type is described by a set of attributes called “schema”.
The set of entities pertaining to a particular entity type share the same set
of attributes. The collection of entities of a particular entity type is grouped
into entity set, called the extension of the entity type. For example,
Entity Type : Accounts
Intension (or structure) of entity type
Entity Set: Collection of entity instances of an entity type “Accounts”
Extension (or instances) of entity type
110001
Capital Account

Fig. 14.7 : Examples on entity type and entity set
Structuring Database for Accounting
(vii) Value Sets of Attributes : Each simple attribute is associated with a value
set, which specifies the set of possible values that may be assigned to a
particular attribute. For example, the value set of voucher date is all those
dates that fall within the dates valid for a given accounting period. Similarly,
if accounting reality states that each code of an account is numeric with
its width equal to six digits, its possible value set shall be 000001 to
999999. The value set as described above is called domain of values.
14.3.3 Identifier (or Key Attributes of an Entity Type)
Almost every entity type has one of its attributes, which contains unique values
for identifying the entity instance. For example, RollNo as attribute of Entity
type students has unique values through which a student instance can be
identified. Similarly, Code is a key attribute of entity type Accounts because its
data values are required to be unique.
Fig. 14.8 : Diagrammatic presentation of an entity
type accounts with code as key attribute
Some times two or more such attribute together (called composite key) may
constitute such distinct values. For example, the student entity type that has
entity instances across several sections of a class in a school shall require a
composite key of attributes (Sections and RollNo). But in any case, it is a
constraint that does not allow any two-entity instances from having the same
value for the key attribute at a point of time. Some entities may have more than
one Key attribute. The entity types, which do not have a key attribute at all are
called weak entities.
14.3.4 Relationships
Relationship among two or more entity types represents an interaction among
their respective entities. Whenever an attribute (say Debit) of one entity type
(say vouchers) refers to another entity type (say Accounts), there exists a
relationship between these entities (Vouchers and Account).
Accountancy
For example, vouchers and accounts are related in two ways: vouchers contain
debit account(s) and vouchers contain credit account(s).  In ER Model, these
references are represented as explicit relationships rather than attributes.
(i) Types of relationships : Whenever entities from different entity types are
related to one another in a particular manner, they constitute a relationship
type. The relationship prepared by between the two entity types vouchers
and employees associates each voucher with the employee who prepared
it. Similarly, the relationship authorised by between the two entity types
vouchers and employees associates each voucher with the employee who
authorises it. Each relationship instance of prepared by (short named as
PrepBy) associates one voucher entity with one employee entity. In ER
diagrams, relationship types are displayed as diamond shaped boxes,
connected by straight lines to the rectangular boxes, which represent the
participating entity types.
Fig. 14.9 : Diagram showing binary relationship between vouchers and employees
(ii) Degree : The degree of a relationship type is the number of participating
entity types. A relationship type of degree two is called binary and that of
degree three is called ternary.  A VOUCHER (entity), Authorised_by
(relationship) and EMPLOYEES (entity) together signify a binary
relationship. A SUPPLIER (entity) SUPPLY (relationship) PARTS (entity) to
PROJECT (entity) signify a ternary relationship because three entities,
namely supplier, parts and projects are participating in supply relationship
in any transaction.
Fig. 14.10 : Diagram showing ternary relationship between suppliers, parts and projects
Structuring Database for Accounting
(iii) Role Names : Each entity type that participates in a relationship type plays
a particular role in the relationship. The role name signifies the role that a
participating entity of an entity type plays in each relationship instance.
In PREPARED BY relationship type, EMPLOYEE plays the role of document
creator and voucher plays the role of document created.
(iv) Structural Constraints : The reality may impose certain constraints (or
restrictions) that may limit the possible combinations of entities,
participating in a given relationship set. These are of two types : Cardinality
Ratio and participation.
Cardinality Ratios for binary relationship specifies the number of
relationship instances that an entity can participate in. In PREP_BY
binary relationship type, VOUCHER:EMPLOYEE  is of cardinality ratio
N:1 implying thereby that a set of vouchers can be created by a
particular employee. The possible cardinality ratios are one to one
(1:1),one to many(1:N),many to one(N:1), and many to many(N:M).
Participation constraint specifies as to whether the existence of an entity
type depends on its being related to another entity via a relationship
type or not. The two types of such constraints are: total and partial.
Whenever semantics of reality require that every entity of an entity
type must relate to another entity type, such an entity can exist only if
it participates in that specific relationship. Such a participation is called
total participation. For example, the participation of ACCOUNTS in
CLASSIFY relationship is total participation. This is because every
account must refer to at least one of the accounts type or a category of
accounts. This participation is also called existence dependency. Since
every employee is not expected to prepare at least one of the vouchers,
the participation of employee in PREPARED BY relationship is partial,
implying that some of employee entities are related to the voucher
entity via PREPARED BY relationship. In ER diagram, total
participation is displayed as double line connecting the participating
entity type to the relationship, whereas partial participation is
represented by a single line.
14.3.5 Weak Entity Types
Entity Types, which do not have identifier (or key attributes) of their own are,
called weak entity types. Such entity types are identified by being related to
specific entities from another entity type in combination with some of their
attribute values. These other entity types are called identifying or owner entity
type. Accordingly, the relationship type that relates a weak entity type to its
owner is called identifying relationship of the weak entity.
Accountancy
A weak entity type always has a total participation constraint (existence
dependency) with respect to its identifying relationship because it cannot be
identified without its owner entity. For example, a voucher may be accompanied
by a set of support documents such as bills, issued by other parties to the
transaction, details of which need be stored. Such SUPPORT’ DOCUMENT entity
type which is used to keep track of support documents attached to each voucher
via 1:N relationship, is a weak entity. This is because they are identified as distinct
entities only after determining the particular voucher. A weak entity type normally
has a partial key, which is a set of attribute that can uniquely identify weak
entities that are related to the same owner entity. Assuming that two support
documents of a voucher do not have the same document Id,  the said Id can be
a good partial key. Otherwise a composite attribute of all the weak entity’s
attributes will be the partial key.
Initial Conceptual Design for an Example Reality : Using a hypothetical example of an
accounting system, as already stated above in Fig: 14.6, following initial design based
on ER Model concepts becomes the starting point of illustration.
Conceptual Design : According to the requirements listed in example reality, there exist
five entities: Vouchers, Accounts, Employees, SupportDocuments and AccountsType·
An entity type Vouchers with attributes Voucher No, Serial No, Voucher Date, Debit
Account, Credit Account, Amount, Narration, authorised by, prepared by are used
for  storing accounting data of a transactions. Debit and amount are multi-valued
attributes for debit vouchers and credit and amount are multi-valued for credit
vouchers. Voucher No and Sno together constitutes the only key attribute of entity
type vouchers. Therefore, it is specified to be unique.
A Conceptual entity type Accounts with attributes Code, Name and Type is used for
keeping and maintaining a record of all accounts.  Both Code and Name qualify to
be the key attributes because of being specified as unique.
An Entity Type Employee with attributes Employee ID (EmpId), Name, Address, Phone,
ID of immediate boss (SuperId) is used to maintain records of employees in the
organisation. Name is a composite attribute with its simple attributes as: First
Name (Fname), Middle Initial (Minit) and Last Name (Lname). The EmpId, specified
to be unique, is the key attribute. SuperId indicates the EmpId of the controlling
officer, the immediate boss.
An entity type, Accounts Type with attributes CatId and Category is used to maintain
records of various categories of accounts so that each of the accounts as stored in
accounts entity are able to find their suitable place in financial accounting reports:
profit and loss account and also the balance sheet.
An entity type called Support with attributes Sno. and Name is used to maintain
records of all the support documents, which are annexed to the accounting voucher.

Accountancy
14.4 Database Technology
It refers to a set of techniques that are used to design a database. These
techniques use certain concepts, which are crucial to the creation of structure
and development of the design. These concepts are: Reality, data, database,
information, DBMS and database system. A brief description of these concepts
is given below:
(a) Reality : It implies some aspect of the real world. It consists of an
organisation, its different components and the environment in which the
organisation exists and operates. Any organisation includes people, facilities
and other resources that are organised to achieve certain goals. Each
organisation operates within an environment. While operating, the
organisation interacts, influences and gets influenced by the environment.
An organisation may be viewed as a system consisting of several components called its
sub-systems. Each of these sub-systems follows certain procedures and continuously
interacts with each other and their external environment to accomplish the goals of
organisation. During the course of their interaction, events take place, which take the
shape of data items. These sub-systems communicate continuously with AIS to provide
data and seek information. A part of AIS is Financial Accounting System, which is designed
for processing accounting transactions. For example,a firm uses a voucher to document
an accounting transaction. The contents of voucher consist of accounting data, which
need be stored in an organised manner.
Fig. 14.15 :  Diagrammatic presentation of an entity type accounts with code as key attribute
Fig.14.16 :  Diagrammatic presentation of an entity type accounts with code as key attribute
Structuring Database for Accounting
This continuous interaction results in real world transactions. These
transactions are analysed with a view to identify the components called data
items. A data item is the smallest named unit of data in an information system.
In a transaction, the names of accounts (or their accounting codes), date of
transaction, amount, etc. is all data items.
(b) Data : Data are known facts that can be recorded and which have implicit
meaning. Data represent facts concerning people, places, objects, entities,
events or even concepts. Data can be quantitative and qualitative or they can
be financial and non-financial in character. Consider the following transaction :
April 01, 2005 Commenced business with Cash Rs. 5,00,000.
This transaction, before being recorded through a Transaction Voucher, as
shown in  figure 14.1, need be split up into its data contents as “01”, 01-Apr-
05, 642001, Bank Account, 110001,Capital Account, Rs.5,00,000. Data are
not useful for decision-making unless they are processed to suit to the
requirements of decision-making situation.
(c) Database : The data, after being collected, has to be stored so that different
people can use them. This requires the creation of a database. A database is
a shared collection of interrelated data tables, files or structures, which are
designed to meet the varied informational needs of an organisation (See
Example database in figure 14.19. It has two important properties (or
characteristics): one it is integrated and second it is shared. Integrated
property implies that distinct data tables have been logically organised. The
purpose is to reduce or eliminate redundancy (or duplicity) and also to
facilitate better data access. The shared property means that all those who
are authorised to use data/information have access to relevant data. Thus,
a database is a collection of related data that represents some aspect of the
real world (called mini-world or Reality). Accordingly, accounting database
is a collection of related accounting data to represent some aspect of an
accounting information system. Database is designed, built and populated
(or loaded) with data for a specific purpose.
(d) Information : refers to data that have been processed and organised in a
form, which is suitable for decision-making. The raw data when processed
in accordance with decision usefulness of a decision-maker becomes
information.  In other words, information is a data that have been processed
and refined and then presented in a format that is convenient for decision-
making or other organisational activities.
Accountancy
Fig. 14.17 :  The diagram showing the transaction data processing and information levels
However, information may be viewed as data at one level. But when it is
processed keeping in view the requirements of decision situation, it becomes
information at another level. For example, accounting data at transaction level
is processed to produce balances of each account. The balances are summarised
to prepare the trial balance. The amounts given in trial balance constitute data
to produce profit and loss account and balance sheet.
(e) Database management System (DBMS) is a collection of programs that
enables users to create and maintain a database. Formally, it may be defined
as a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining,
constructing and manipulating (or processing) databases for various
applications. General-purpose software is defined as a set of programs, which
are designed and developed for a community of users and not for any
particular application with respect to a particular user.
14.5 An Illustration of Accounting Database
Consider an example of ACCOUNTING database for maintaining data pertaining
to accounting transactions, support documents, accounts and employees with
which the students of accounting are familiar. Figure 14.18 shows below the

Structuring Database for Accounting
Modified Version of Accounting Database : An attempt to accommodate Debit
and Credit vouchers, as shown in Figure: 14.2 and 14.3, results in adding a
new column Sno to Vouchers table of database, which is shown in modified
database in figure 14.19. This results in data redundancy as shown in figure
14.20.
ER Model, as already discussed above, is a conceptual model, which need
be transformed into a representational data model so that   a database design is
formed for being implemented and operated upon by using DBMS. From among
several representational models, Relational Data Model (RDM) is the most popular
and widely used in actual practice. Let us understand some important concepts
of RDM.
14.6 Relational Data Model
The relational data model represents the database as collection of relations, which
resembles a table of values (or data table). Each row of the table, therefore,
represents a collection of related data values and hence typically corresponds to
real world entity or relationship. The table name and column names are used to
help in interpreting the meaning of values in each row. Each row of a table is
called a data record. All values in a column, which belong to a particular domain,
are of same data type
Consider the following table of data items, named as Accounts. The table
has rows and columns. The column arrow points to a column called Name. The
Row arrow points to a data record consisting of (110001, Capital Account and
4) each of which corresponds to Code, Name and Type, which are three different
columns of the table.

Fig. 14.21 : Example data table of accounts and their attribute values
Formally, a row is called a tuple, a column header is called an attribute and
the table as such is called a relation. The data type describing the types of
values (such as text value, numeric values, date values, currency value, etc.)
that can appear in each column is called a domain. A domain is a set of indivisible
values. Associated with every domain is a data type such as Number,
Accountancy
Text, Currency, Date/Time, etc. Each domain must also be named so as to help
in interpreting its values. Besides this, a domain must be given a format and
any additional information to enable correct interpretation of values. For
example, a numeric domain such as distance should have units of measurement:
Miles or Kilometers
(a) Relations : A relation schema is made up of a relation name and a list of its
attributes. Each attribute is the name of role played by some domain in
the relation schema. A relation is given an identity by its name and
description by its schema. The degree of a relation is indicated by the
number of attributes it contains. For example, the degree of a relation schema
accounts is three as shown below :
ACCOUNTS (Code, Name, Type)
✄ Relation with attributes
ACCOUNTS is name of the relation which has three attributes;
Code  = Identity of Account;
Name = Names of Account;
Type  = Category of Account
A Relation represents an entity type. A relation (or relation state) is a set
of tuples wherein each tuple is an ordered list of values corresponding to
attributes of relation. Each of these values must belong to the domains of
their respective attributes. Each tuple in this relation represents a particular
entity.  A relation schema may be interpreted as a declaration in the nature of
an assertion. For example, the schema of accounts relation, as shown above,
asserts that every account has a Code, Name and a Type. As a result, each
tuple in accounts relation can be interpreted as a fact or an instance of
assertion. Some relations represent facts about entities while others might
represent facts about relationships.
(b) Values in Tuples : Each value in a tuple is an indivisible value to imply
that it is not divisible into components within the framework of the basic
relational model. This implies that composite and multi-valued attributes
are not allowed. Composite attributes are represented by their simple
components. The multi-valued attributes are represented by separate
relations. A special value called Null is used to represent unknown or not
applicable values of attributes in a tuple. It is also possible to devise different
types of code values for different types of null value situation.
14.7 Relational Databases and Schemas
A relational database schema is a set of relation schemas and a set of integrity
constraints. A relational database state is a set of relation states such that every
relational database state satisfies the integrity constraints specified on relational
database schema.
Structuring Database for Accounting
In this context the following points merit a special consideration :
(a) A particular attribute, which stands for the same real word concept,  might
appear in more than one relation with same or different  name. For example,
in vouchers relation, the account Number is represented as debit and credit
whereas in accounts relation, it is represented as Code (figure 14.19). EmpId
appearing in Employees relation is represented in Vouchers as Auth.By and
Prep.By.
(b) The particular real world concept  appearing more than once in a relation
must be represented by different names. For example, in employees relation,
employee is represented as subordinate, by using EmpId and as superior by
using SuperId.
(c) The Integrity constraints, specified on database schema, must hold in
every database state of that schema.
14.8 Constraints and Database Schemas
There are four different constraints, which can be specified on relational
databases. These are: domain constraint; key constraint; entity integrity
constraint; referential integrity constraints.
(a) Domain : The value of each attribute of a relation must be an indivisible
value and drawn out of possible values associated with its domain.  The
value of an attribute, therefore, must conform to the data type associated
with the domain.
(b) Key Constraints and NULL Values : Each data record, which corresponds
to a tuple of a relation, in a table must be distinct. That means no two
tuples (or rows) in a relation ( or table) can have the same combination of
values for all their data items. This is because that a relation, as set of
tuples, has to have all its tuples distinct by definition. Every relation has
at least one key by default, which is the combination of all its attributes.
This is called super-key by default. Any such super-key, therefore, specifies
uniqueness constraint. Such a combination, representing super-key, may
have redundant attributes, implying thereby that a more useful concept
is that of a key which has not redundancy. This can be shown
diagrammatically  as shown in figure 14.22. Therefore, minimal super-key
(also called Key) is defined as that part of super-key from which any attribute
cannot be removed without sacrificing the uniqueness constraint. The value
of key attribute can be used to identify each tuple in a relation. A key is
determined from the meaning of the attributes. The uniqueness feature of
key must continue to hold when new tuple in a relation is added. Sometimes
a relation may have more than one key in which case each of such keys is
called a candidate key. One such key is termed as primary key of relation.
The choice of which candidate key to be primary is generally subjective
Accountancy
and may depend on circumstances of mini-world. For Example: Both
PAN(Permanent Account Number) and EMPID are candidate keys in
EMPLOYEES relation because of being unique. But EMPID should be selected
in an organisation being native to the organisational environment.
Fig. 14.22 : Flow chart to reach a minimal super-key
(c) Entity integrity constraint : States that no primary key value can be null
because it is used to identify individual tuple in a relation. Null value implies
that we cannot identify such tuples or identify these as alike. A failure to
distinguish them means they are duplicates.
(d) Referential integrity constraint : While key and entity constraints are
specified on individual relation, the referential integrity constraint is specified
between two or more relations. This constraint is specified to maintain
consistency among the tuples of such relations. Accordingly, a tuple in one
relation that refers to another relation must refer to an existing tuple in that
other relation. In referencing Accounts Type, Accounts relation uses its
attribute Type, which acts as foreign key to reference the tuples of relation
Accounts Type through its primary key CatId. The value of Type cannot be
null because of total participation of Accounts in classify relationship.
Similarly, consider another example in which the relation Vouchers
Structuring Database for Accounting
(Vno, Sno, Vdate, Debit, Amount, Credit, Amount, Prep_by, Auth_by,
Narration) references two other relations as shown in figure 14.19.
First it references, Accounts (Code, Name, Type). In referencing Accounts,
the Vouchers relation uses its attributes Debit and Credit, which act as Foreign
Keys to reference the tuples of relation Accounts through its primary key,
Code. The values of debit and credit cannot be null because of total
participation of vouchers in debit and credit relationship.
Second, it references Employees (EmpId, Fname, Minit, Lname, Address,
PhoneNo, SuperId). While referencing Employees, the Vouchers relation
makes use of its other attributes Prep.By and Auth.By. These attributes act
as foreign keys to reference the tuples of relation Employees through its key
attribute EmpId. The values of PrepBy and AuthBy cannot be null because
of total participation of vouchers in PrepBy and Authby relationships.
The referential integrity constraint stands violated in above example, if
there is a debit or credit code in voucher relation, the tuple for which does
not exist in Accounts relation. Similarly, referential integrity fails, if there
exists a value corresponding to Auth.By or Prep.By attribute of vouchers,
the tuple for which does not exist in employees relation.
14.9 Operations and Constraint Violations
There are two categories of operations on relational model : updates and retrieval
The three basic types of updates are as given below :
(a) Insert : This operation is performed to add a new tuple in a relation. For
example, an attempt to add another record of an account with data values
corresponding to Code, Name and its Type to Accounts relation shall be
made by performing Insert operation. The insert operation is capable of
violating any of the four constraints discussed above.
(b) Delete : This operation is carried out to remove a tuple from a relation. A
particular data record from a table can be removed by performing such a
operation. The delete operation can violate only referential integrity, if tuple
being removed is referenced by foreign key from other tuples in the database.
(c) Modify : The operation aims at causing a change in the values of some
attributes in existing tuples. This is useful in modifying existing values of an
accounting record in a data table. Usually, this operation does not cause
problems provided the modification is directed on neither primary key nor
foreign key.
Whenever applied, these operations must enforce integrity constraints
specified on relational database schema.
Retrieval operation on Relational Data Model does not cause violation
any integrity constraints.
Accountancy
14.10 Designing Relational Database Schema
The rules or guidelines required to design the relational database schema attempt
to provide a step-by-step procedure that transforms ER design into Relational
Data model design to constitute the desired database. In the context of ER model
as shown in design figure14.12, the following specific steps are required to cause
its transformation into relational data model :
(i) Create a relation for every strong entity : For each strong entity type
(which has primary key) in ER schema, a separate relation that includes
all the simple attributes of that entity is created. Either choose one of the
key attributes of such an entity as the primary key for this relation, or
choose a set of simple attributes that uniquely identify this entity as the
primary key of the relation so created. For example, employee entity is
strong because it finds its primary key in EmpId which is one of its unique
attribute. Therefore, a separate relation for Employee has been created as
shown below :
Employee (EmpId, Fname, Minit,Lname,Address, PhoneNo, SuperId)
Similarly, separate relations need be created for the following strong entities
whose Primary Key attribute have been underlined.
Accounts (Code, Name, Type)
Vouchers (VNo,vDate, amount, narration)
Accounts Type (CatId, Category)
(ii) Create a separate relation for each weak entity type : Every weak entity
has an owner entity and an identifying relationship through which such
weak entity type is identified. For every weak entity type, a separate relation
is created by including its attributes. The primary key of this new relation
is the combination of its unique attribute(s) for a particular tuple of the
owner relation along with primary key attribute of such owner relation.
Furthermore, the primary key of owner entity is included as foreign key in
such a relation key of owner entity and the partial key of weak entity.
For example, Support Entity, with Vouchers as its owner Entity, does not
have a primary key of its own. It has partial key which is the Sno assigned
to each document. Therefore, the Primary key of Vouchers, Vno along
with Sno is designed as composite key for support entity and the relation
so formed is shown below as :
Support (vNo,Sno, dName,sDate)
(iii) Identify entity types participating in binary 1:N relationship type : Identify
the first relation on n-side of relationship and second on 1-side of such
relationship. The primary key of second relation should be included in
first relation as its foreign key. For Example, An employee can authorize a
number of vouchers. It implies that Vouchers entity participates in Auth.By
Structuring Database for Accounting
relationship on n-side while Employees entity participates in same
relationship on 1-side. Therefore, the vouchers relation as already formed
above in step 1, must also include as foreign key the primary key of
Employees, which is EmpId.  Similarly, we can deal with Prep.By
relationship in which Employees and Vouchers again participate in binary
1:N relationship. The end result of mapping both these relationships is to
include twice the EmpId, but in different roles. Since a relation cannot
have same name  (here EmpId twice to mean AuthBy and PrepBy), we use
their role names as attributes in Vouchers relation as foreign keys to
reference Employees relation.
Accordingly, the modified Vouchers relation appears as given below:
Vouchers (VNo, vDate, Amount, Narration, Auth.By, Prep.By)
Similarly, there exist two relationships between the relations Vouchers
and Accounts. The relation Vouchers as modified above shall further
include as foreign key the primary key of Accounts relation, which is code.
This code is to be included twice. One to represent debit and another to
represent credit relationship. Since a relation cannot have same name (here
Code is being included twice to mean Debit and Credit), we use their role
names as attributes in Vouchers relation as foreign keys to reference
Accounts relation. The modified vouchers relation shall appear as follows:
Vouchers (Vno,Vdate, Debit, Credit, Amount, Narration, AuthBy, Prep.By)
(iv) Identify entity types participating in binary M:N relationship type : For
each binary M:N relationship type, create a new relation to represent such
relationship. This new relation should include as foreign keys, the primary
keys of the relations that represent the participating entity types. For
example, consider the following entities and relationships in the context of
credit voucher shown in figure 14.23, which has one debit with multiple
credit accounts :
Fig. 14.23 : ER Diagram showing relationships between vouchers and accounts in the
context of credit vouchers, with one debit and several credit entries
Accountancy
In this case, relationship Credit has cardinality ratio of M:N between Vouchers
and Accounts(many vouchers are related to many accounts), While relationship
Debit has cardinality ratio of N:1 (many vouchers refer to one account). Further
Credit relationship has Sno, amount and narration has its attributes. Accordingly,
we create a new relation as follows :
Credit (vNo, Sno, Code, Amount, Narration)
In above relation credit Code is included as foreign key to represent primary
key of accounts relation, Vno is included as foreign key to represent primary
key of relation vouchers. (Vno,Code) constitute the primary key of this new
relation credit. By analogy, we can arrive at the following relation for Debit
voucher:
Debit (vNo, Sno, Code, Amount, Narration)
Finally, the following relations have been formed to constitute the relational
data model for our example reality.
Employee (EmpId, Fname, Minit,Lname,Address, PhoneNo, SuperId)
Accounts (Code, Name, Type)
Vouchers (VNo,Vdate, debit, credit, amount, narration, AuthBy, PrepBy)
AccountsType (CatType, Category)
Support (VNo,Sno,Dname,Sdate)
If we adopt the additional semantics the vouchers relation shall appear in
two different schemas :
Situation A : The schema given below is compatible with Debit voucher as shown
if figure 14.3.
Vouchers (vNo,vDate, Credit, Auth.By, Prep.By)
Debit (vNo, Sno, Code, Amount, Narration)
Situation B : The schema given below is compatible with  Credit voucher as
shown if figure 14.2.
Vouchers (vNo,vDate, debit, AuthBy, PrepBy)
Credit (vNo, Sno, Code, Amount, Narration)
A generalised Schema for the two schemas shall be
Vouchers (vNo,vDate,Vtype, AccCode, vType,  AuthBy, PrepBy)
Details ( vno, Sno, Code, Amount, Narration)
Where in another attribute vType has been introduced to indicate whether
this generalised schema applies to Situation A(vType=0) or Situation B(vType=1).
Debit and Credit attribute of vouchers relation have been renamed as AccCode
to mean Debit and Credit, depending on the value of Vtype. Debit and Credit
relations have been generalised into Details because both shared a set of common
attributes.
Structuring Database for Accounting
14.11 llustrating the Database Structure for Example Realities
DBMS software is used to implement the data model by creating several tables,
setting their interrelationships and imposing constraints as may be set out in
database design. After, the design is implemented, it must also allow for retrieval
of data and information. This is achieved by querying the database, for which
purpose, SQL statements are put to use. These retrieval requests result in
emergence of new virtual tables that may be formed out of one or more of existing
tables.  A clear understanding of these SQL statements is a first step towards
the theoretical foundations for computerised reporting. This is because a report
is an organised set of information, which is extracted on the basis of these retrieval
requests. For a practical understanding of these operations, consider the following
Models, herein referred to as Model-I and Model-II. Each of these models, which
consist of a set of relations (or tables) and the integrity constraints, constitutes
the database design for accounting.
Model-I : This is based on initial conceptual design of example reality shown in
Figure: 14.11
Fig. 14.24 : Schema diagram for the accounting
system relational database schema
Model-II : The set relations given below are based on modified example  reality
that uses Credit and Debit vouchers shown in figures 14.2 and 14.3.

Shortcomings
The above solution, being based on transaction voucher with one debit and one credit in a
transaction requires multiple vouchers for one real transaction. For example, a transaction
dated April 30, 2005 “Salary for the month paid by cheque” requires four vouchers 29 to
32. One transaction should be recorded possibly through one voucher only.
Solution
The solution based on Model-II which lends support to Debit Voucher (with Multiple Debits
and one Credit) and Credit voucher (with one Debit and multiple Credits) as shown in

Indicate against each of the following statements, True or False :
Every relation has at least one super key by default, which is the combination
of all its attributes.
Data transformation is called Information.
Referential integrity constraint arises because of relationships between various
entities.
The complete absence of WHERE clause in SELECT statement implies that
no tuples of a relation shall be selected.

When a relation has more than one attribute with unique values, each such
attribute is called ............
After appreciating the way accounting data is presented in above database models, let
us understand as to how the queries on such databases are expressed as relational
operations.
Structuring Database for Accounting
14.12 Interacting with Databases
One of the major reasons for the success of commercial databases is the SQL
language support they enjoy. This is because SQL became standard for relational
databases. As a result, users have become less concerned about migrating their
database applications from one database to another database. Another advantage
in using standard SQL is that users may write statements in a database
application program that can access data stored in two or more relational DBMS
without having to change the database sub-language (SQL) provided both the
DBMS enjoy the support of a particular SQL standard.
The  name SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which was originally
called SEQUEL (Structured English QUEry  Language), designed and
implemented at IBM Research as an  interface for experimental relational database
system called SYSTEM-R.
Being a comprehensive database language, it has statements for data
definition, query and update. Besides this, it has the capability to define user-
oriented views of database, specify security and authorisation, define integrity
constraints and various other operations. Many computer-programming
languages can act as good host languages to incorporate the statements of SQL.
In this sense, it can be used as a sub-language in a database-programming
context.
Basic Queries in SQL : Data Query Language (DQL), which is a sub-set of SQL
is widely used to answer most of the basic queries. The basic set of queries
consists of those, for which the SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure is put to use
as described below :
SELECT : This clause is used to specify the data or information that is desired
to answer the query.
FROM : This clause is used to specify the source of data for answering the
query. It can be a data table, an existing query or both.
WHERE : This clause is meant to specify the conditions that are used to
narrow down the choice of data to extract the information desired in select
clause.
The following queries have been considered using the database design given
in Model-I and Model-II. The solution to queries has been given using MS
ACCESS implementation.
I. Query to retrieve all columns of data records from a table, subject to a
condition : To project all the attribute values of selected tuples, an asterisk
(*) need be specified. This asterisk stands for all the attributes.
To retrieve all columns of voucher records whose voucher has been authorised
by an employee whose EmpId is equal to “A001”.
Accountancy
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT *
vouchers
WHERE
AuthBy=”A001”;
II. Query to retrieve selected columns of data records from a table, subject
to a condition.
To Retrieve vouchers with Vno, Vdate, AuthBy columns wherein the vouchers
are dated “12/Apr/2005”
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT
Vno, Vdate, AuthBy
vouchers
WHERE
Vdate = #04/12/2005#;
To retrieve vouchers with Vno, Vdate, Auth_by columns, which are dated “12/
Apr/2005”. The columns of records retrieved by the query are to be renamed
as Voucher, Date and Employee
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT
Vno As Voucher, Vdate As Date, Prep_by As Employee
vouchers
WHERE
Vdate = # 04/12/2005#;
III. Unspecified WHERE Clause : Absence of WHERE clause in SELECT
statement implies that the tuples from a relation are to be selected without
applying any condition. This in turn means that all tuples of a relation
specified in FROM clause qualify for being selected for the result of query.
Consider the following query with reference to Model-I.
Find out the list of accounts which have been debited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT  DISTINCT Debit As Code
FROM    vouchers;
Structuring Database for Accounting
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT
AccCode As Code
vouchers
WHERE
vType = 0;
UNION
SELECT
Details.Code
vouchers, Details
WHERE
vType = 1 AND vouchers.vNo = Details.vNo;
Save above query as DebitAccounts, and thereafter execute another query as
given below to get the final results.
SELECT DISINCT *
Debit Accounts ;
Find out the list of accounts which have been credited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT  DISTINCT Credit As Code
vouchers ;
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT
AccCode As Code
vouchers
WHERE
Vtype = 1;
UNION
SELECT
Details.Code
vouchers, Details
WHERE
vType = 0 AND vouchers.vNo = Details.vNo;
Save above query as CreditAccounts, and thereafter execute another query as
given below to get the final results.
SELECT DISINCT *
CreditAccounts;
Find out the list of accounts which have been debited as well as credited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT  DISTINCT Debit As Code
vouchers
WHERE
Debit IN (SELECT Credit As Code
vouchers);
Accountancy
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT *
DebitAccounts
WHERE
Code IN (SELECT *
CreditAccounts);
Save above solution query as DebitCredit, both for Model-I and
Model-II
Find out the list of accounts which have been debited but not credited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
DISTINCT Debit As Code
vouchers
WHERE
Debit NOT IN (SELECT Code
DebitCredit);
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT *
DebitAccounts
WHERE
Code NOT IN (SELECT *
DebitCredit)
Find out the list of accounts which have been credited but not debited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT DISTINCT Credit As Code
vouchers
WHERE
Credit NOT IN (SELECT Code
DebitCredit);
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT *
CreditAccounts
WHERE
Code NOT IN ( SELECT *
DebitCredit)
IV. Ambiguous Attribute Names and Renaming (Aliasing) : SQL allows the
use of homonyms (that is same name for two or more attributes) as long
as such attributes are in different relations. If the use of a common attribute
with a particular name across the relations prevails, it becomes necessary
Structuring Database for Accounting
to qualify the attribute name with relation name in which it exits. This is
achieved by prefixing the relation name to the attribute name and
separating the two by a period symbol dot. In Model-II, the attribute Vno,
referring to voucher number in vouchers relation, also exists in details
relation. Whenever vouchers and details relations are used in a query, the
use of Vno attribute must precede the name of relation or its alias name.
For example,
Retrieve a list of accounts and the amounts debited because of cash payments.
The Cash Account code begins with “631”.
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
Narration, Debit As Code, Amount
Vouchers
WHERE
Credit LIKE “631*”;
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT
Narration,Acc_code AS Code, Amount
Vouchers AS V, Details AS D
WHERE
tType=1 AND V.vNo=D.vNo
acc_code like “631*”
UNION
SELECT
Narration,Code, Amount
Vouchers AS V, Details AS D
WHERE
tType = 0 AND V.vNo = D.vNo
AND code LIKE “631*”;
To retrieve a detailed list of all accounts, giving their code, Name and category.
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT Code, Name, Category
FROM  Accounts, AccountType
WHERE CatId = Type
To retrieve a detailed list of all account, giving their code, Name and category,
which have been debited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
DISTINCT Debit AS Code, Name, Category
Vouchers AS V,Accounts AS A, AccountType
WHERE
V.Debit = A.Code AND CatId = type
Accountancy
Solution
(Model-II by  using query solution saved as DebitAccounts in Q.No: 4)
SELECT Code, Name, Category
FROM DebitAccounts AS D, Accounts AS A, Category
WHERE D.Code = A.Code AND Type = CatId
To retrieve Code, Name and Category of Expense accounts which have been
debited
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
Debit AS Code, Name, Category
Vouchers, Accounts, AccountType
WHERE
Debit = Code AND Type = CatId
AND Category = “Expenses”
Solution
(Model-II by  using query solution saved as Debit Accounts in Q.No: 4)
SELECT
D.Code, Name, Category
DebitAccounts AS D, Accounts AS A, AccountType
WHERE
D.Code = A.code AND Type = CatId
AND Category = “Expenses”
To retrieve Narration and Amount of transactions where Expense head
“Carriage Inwards” has been debited.
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
Narration, Amount
Vouchers, Accounts
WHERE
Debit = Code
AND Name LIKE “Carriage Inw*”;
Solution
(Model-II by  using query solution saved as DebitAccounts in Q.No: 4)
SELECT
Narration, Amount
Details AS T,DebitAccounts AS D, Accounts AS A
WHERE
T.Code = D.Code AND D.Code = A.Code
AND Name LIKE “Carriage Inw*”
V. Sub-string Comparisons and Arithmetic Operators and Ordering and use
of functions : SQL allows comparison on sub-strings (that are some parts
of a character string). This can be achieved by use of LIKE Operator.  This
like operator instead of equal to (=) operator can be used when exact value
Structuring Database for Accounting
of comparison is not known. Partial strings or sub-strings are specified by
using * and range specification within rectangular brackets. For Example:
To make a list of accounts pertaining to the assets of the company, given that
each of the assets account code begins with “4”, following query need be
executed:
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT
Code, Name
accounts
WHERE
Code like “4*”
To make a list of employees whose names start from a to k, following query
need be executed :
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT
Fname & “ “ & Minit & “ “ & Lname  As ‘Name of Employee’
Employees
WHERE
Fname like “[a-e]*”
VI. Another comparison operator used in SQL is BETWEEN ....AND
....operator. This operator facilitates numeric range tests for selection of
tuples. For Example:
To retrieve vouchers with amount ranging between 5,000 and 10,000, following
query need be formulated.
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
Vno, Amount
Vouchers
WHERE
Amount BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 ;
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT
Vno, Amount
Vouchers AS V, Details AS D
WHERE.
V.vno = D.vno AND Amount   BETWEEN 5,000 AND 10,000;
VII. Another feature of SQL permits the use of standard arithmetic operators,
which can be directly applied to numeric values appearing in a query
statement. Consider the following query:
Accountancy
To find various amounts of sales during the month of April, 2005 and the
amounts of such sales if the prices of products are allowed to be raised by
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
Vdate, Credit, Amount, Amount*1.16 AS Expected
Vouchers, Accounts
WHERE
Credit = Code AND name LIKE “Sales Account*”
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT
Vdate, D.code, Amount, Amount*1.16 AS Expected
Vouchers AS V, Details AS D, accounts AS  A
WHERE
V.vNo = D.vNo AND D.code = A.Code AND A.Name LIKE
“Sales Account*” AND tType = 1
UNION
SELECT
Vdate, V.Acc_code, Amount, Amount*1.16 AS Expected
Vouchers AS V, Details AS D, accounts AS  A
WHERE
V.vno = D.vno AND V.acc_code = A.code AND A.name LIKE
“Sales Account*” AND Ttype = 0;
VIII. SQL also allows ordering of resultant tuples according to some specified
attribute, which may or may not form part of the resultant relation. Consider
the following example:
To retrieve list of Accounts in dictionary order of their Names :
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT  *
FROM Accounts
ORDER BY Name
IX. SQL queries allow the use of supported functions within the query itself.
List of these functions varies from one implementation to another depending
on the specific RDBMS. Consider the following example :
To List details of vouchers released during April, 2005.
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT  *
FROM vouchers
WHERE Month(vDate) = 4
Structuring Database for Accounting
To execute above query, month() function is used which accepts within parenthesis
the data a parameter and returns the numeric value of one month varying from 1
through 12. In this case the relevant value to be compared for the month of April
is 4.
X. Explicit Sets and NULL in SQL : Query results can be retrieved even for
rows in which value of an attribute is missing. This is achieved by using
NULL in Where clause while specifying the condition. If more than one
value is to be compared with an attribute, the value set can be given in
Where clause by specifying IN operator.
To retrieve Details of Accounts with following Codes: relating to “621001”,
“632021” and “642002”.
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT *
Accounts
WHERE
Code IN(“621001”,”632001”,”642002”);
To retrieve name of all employees who do not have supervisors.
Solution
(Model-I and Model-II)
SELECT *
Employees
WHERE
SuperId = NULL;
XI. Aggregate Functions and Grouping : The concept of aggregate functions
as referred to in relational operations, is implemented by SQL. Five such
functions commonly used for aggregate of data items are: COUNT,SUM,
MAX, MIN and  AVG. These functions when applied on a set  of numeric
values, return respectively number of rows, the sum , maximum, minimum
and average of these values. The GROUP BY clause is used for providing
the basis of creating collection of data items on which these functions are
to be applied. Consider the following examples.
To find the sum, minimum and  maximum of cash payment during April,
2005. The cash account code begins with “631”
Solution
(Model-I)
SELECT
Debit AS Code, SUM(Amount) AS Total,
MIN(Amount) As Minimum, MAX(Amount) As Maximum
Vouchers
WHERE
Debit like “631*”
GROUP BY
Debit
Accountancy
Solution
(Model-II)
SELECT
Code, SUM(Amount) AS Total,
MIN(Amount) As Minimum, MAX(Amount) As Maximum
Vouchers  AS V, Details AS D
WHERE
V.Vno=D.Vno, Ttype=0 and Code Like “631*”
GROUP BY

Summary with Reference to Learning Objectives
(1) Database Concepts
Reality : It consists of different components of an organisation such as people,
facilities and other resources.
Data : It represent data concerning people, places, objects entities, events, etc.
and non-financial 14 nature.
Database : It was a shared collection of inter-related data tables, tiles or structures
which are designed to most varied information needs of all organisation.
International : Processed data organisation in a form that is suitable for decision-
making.
DBMS : A collection of programmes that enable users to create and maintain a
database.
(2) Database System Concepts and Architecture
Data model : Collection of concepts used to describe the structure of a database.
Database Schemes : The description of a database is called its scheme.
Data Base State and Instances : Data in a database at a particular movement is
called database state.
(3) Entity Relationship (ER) Model
An important concept of data model mostly used in data base oriented application.
The major elements of ER model are entities, Attributes, identities and relationship
that are used to express reality for which a data base is to be designed.
Structuring Database for Accounting
(4) Relation Data Model (RDM)
It represent the database at collection of tables comprising different volumes. It
consists of rows and columns. The table name and column name are used to help
in interpreting the meaning  of volumes of each row. Each row of table is called a
data record.

n chapter 14, you have learnt about the
fundamentals of creating a database design in
the context of accounting system. This chapter deals
with the basics of MS Access for implementing the
databases and specifically deals with implementa-
tion of accounting databases, the design of which
has been shown, described and discussed in chapter
14 as Model-I and Model-II. The accounting
database design has been discussed below in terms
of its implementation modalities in the context of
MS Access.
15.1 MS Access and its Components
It is one of the popularly used Database Management
System (DBMS) to create, store and manage
database. It is also popularly  called ACCESS.
Every component that is created using Access
is an object and several such similar objects
constitute a class. Access is functionally available
with the following seven-object classes.  Each of
these object classes is capable of creating their
respective object replicas.
Tables : This object class allows a database
designer to create the data tables with their
respective fieldnames, data types and properties.
Queries : This object class is meant to create the
SQL compatible query statement with or without
the help of Graphic User Interface (GUI) to define
tables, store data and retrieve both data and
information.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

information queries.
Accounting System Using
Database Management System
Accounting System using DBMS
Forms : This object class allows the designer to create an appropriate user
interface to formally interact with the back end database, defined by the
tables and queries.
Reports: This object class is used to create various reports, the source of
information content of which is based on tables, queries or both. Such
reports are designed in Access according to the requirement of end-user.
Pages : This object class is meant to create Data Access Pages, which can
be posted on a Web site of an organisation using Internet or sent via
e-mail to someone of the organisation’s network.
Macros : In macro programming, the objects using individual instructions
called macro-oriented actions are manipulated. A Macro is a list of macro-
oriented actions that run as a unit. Access provides for such Macro
programming.
Fig. 15.1 : An example of database window to work in Access
Modules : These are the foundations of any application and allow the
designer to create a set of programming instructions, called functions or
sub-routines that can be used throughout the application.
Accountancy
The functions return a value while subroutines do not return any value.
Access provides for creating such modules.
Each of these object classes is contained in the named database file of
Access with MDB extension. Whenever this file is opened, a database window,
as shown on next page, opens with all the above object classes available on
the left hand side. As and when the specific objects are created or designed,
they get listed on right hand side of this window against each of these object
classes.
Box 1
Capabilities of MS Access
Access has certain capabilities, which bring it closer to an ideal Database
Management System. These capabilities are :
Storing the data in an organised manner.
Enforcing data integrity constraints.
Representing complex relationship among data.
Providing for persistent storage of database objects.
Restricting unauthorised access to database.
Allowing fast retrieval of data with or without processing by using SQL.
Flexibility to create multiple user interfaces.
Providing for data sharing and multi-user transaction processing.
Supporting multiple views of data and information.
15.1.1 Access Basics for Creating a Database
When a new database is created from the scratch, there is complete control
over the database objects, their properties and the relationships. In order to
create a new database without the help of database wizard (that is an
automated process in Access), the following steps are required :
(i) Open Access Window to choose blank Access database and click OK
button.
(ii) Access responds by displaying File New Database dialog box, which
prompts the designer to enter a file name and a location for the database.
This must be followed by clicking Create button.
(iii) If the task pane is not open, choose File from menu bar and click at
new to open the task pane to create a new database.
15.1.2 Creating of Tables in Access
The creation of tables in Access requires the following steps and understanding
of the components of table object.
Accounting System using DBMS
Click at Tables object of Access, followed by double click at create table by
design view. This results in providing a table window, the upper part of
which has three columns: Field Name, Data Type and Description. It is meant
to define the schema of a table being created. Each of its rows corresponds to
a column of the table being created. Two primary properties of the column of
a table are its field name and data type.
(a) Field name : refers to column name of the table being created. The name of
the column should be a string of contiguous characters. The Field name is
meant to define the name of column to be created, followed by data type of
such column.  The designer can optionally provide description of the column
also. Once the data type is defined, the designer can further specify the
properties of each column in the lower part of the Table window.
(b) Data Types : Access supports different data types, the details of which are
as given below :
Text : It is used for a string of characters: words or numbers that are
not to be used in any arithmetic calculations. The maximum length for
a text field is 255 characters. It is the default data type because of
being used most frequently.
Memo : It is used for storing comments and is capable of accommodating
65,536 characters. But a field with this data type is not amenable to
sorting or filtering of data records.
Number : It is meant to store numbers, which could be integers (-32768
to 32767), long integers (–2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), bytes
( 0 – 255), single (to store values with decimal point up to a certain
limit), double (to store values in decimal point with greater magnitude
and more precision) or decimal types.
Date/Time : It is used to store dates, times or a combination of both.
Currency : It is used for storing numbers in terms of Dollars, Rupees or
other Currencies.
AutoNumber : It is a numeric data automatically entered by Access. It
is of particular importance in a situation where none of the fields
individually or a set of fields as a combination in a table is unique.
Yes/No : It is to declare a logical field which may have only one of the two
opposite values alternatively given as: Yes or No, On or Off, True or False.
OLE Object : OLE stands for Object Linking and Embedding. It refers to
an object that could be a photograph, bar code image or another
document created in another software application.
Hyperlink : This data type is meant to store a Universal Resource Locator
(URL) and e-mail addresses.
(c) Properties : Once the data type of a column is specified, Access allows the
designer to define the properties of each column. These properties are of
two types General and Look up.
Accountancy
(i) General : In the context of text data type the general properties are :
Field Size : This property, in case of text fields, refers to the maximum
number of characters allowed in the column. The same property, in
case of numbers, refers to the type of numbers being stored as per
requirements.
Format : It is meant to indicate as to how the field’s contents are
displayed. There are standard types of formats to choose from.
Decimal places property : It applies to single, double or decimal types
of numbers.
Input mask : Formats for data entry that include placeholders and
punctuations are called input masks. It works only for text and date
type of fields. It is of particular importance when the accounting codes
being used in the system are formatted with hyphens.
Caption : It is a label used for the field in datasheet view and on the
Forms and reports. If the caption property is set to blank, the field
name becomes the default caption and is used to label the field.
Default Value : It is used for specifying a value for new entries of data
records. While entering the data item, the operator can always over
write the default value. The default value should be the most frequently
entered value in the field.
Validation Rule and Text : Validation means checking of data to eliminate
incorrect entries. Validation criteria can be specified for this property.
If the data so entered does not satisfy the validation criteria, the
validation text gets displayed.
Required and Indexed : The Required property must be provided a logical
value Yes or No. When a field’s required property is set to Yes, a user
must enter data in the field before saving the record. A value of No
implies that the data entry in the field is optional. In other words, a
null value is also acceptable to the database.   Indexing a field results
in speeding up sorting, searching and filtering of records on that field.
Primary key field is always indexed. For a single field primary key,
Access sets the Required property to Yes and the Indexed property to
Yes (No duplicates) because a primary key by definition must have
unique values without null entries.
Allow-Zero Length :  This property is available only for text fields. Setting
it to Yes/No determines whether a text string with zero length is a
valid entry or not.
(ii) Look up : The look up feature is used by a field to find its values in another
table, query or from a fixed list of values. A list of valid values can be
displayed using a list box or combo box. Text box is the default display
control of look up. Look up is created in case of a field, which is foreign
Accounting System using DBMS
key (many side) into primary key (one side) between the tables that have
one-to-many relationship. Its other display controls are list control and
combo control. When list box or combo box is used as display control in
look up, it is important to specify the row source type (that is table, query
or list of values or field list). The list of values must be separated by comma.
Some additional properties in case of list box or combo box are meant to
specify the bound column whose values are copied to this field as references.
Number of columns to appear in the list box or combo box is determined
by column count property.
The above steps for defining a column need be repeated for every column
to be created for a particular table.
After defining all the columns of the table, the primary key column of
the table can be specified as any of the columns that are expected to
have unique data values. This can be achieved by right clicking at the
field to be specified as primary key followed by primary key item of
right clicked window. If more than one field constitutes a primary key,
select first field (of such composite primary key) by pressing and holding
Ctrl key and clicking other fields (of the composite primary key) one by
one in the same order in which they together constitute the primary
key. This must be followed by right click at selected fields to mark the
selected fields as primary key.
Save the table design by clicking at File item of menu bar followed by
click at Save option. Access responds by providing a generic default
name of table. The table name provided by Access may be accepted by
clicking at OK or changed by re-typing another name at the input
dialog box. This must be followed by clicking OK. The table stands
created and appears as listed to the right of table object.
Every other table, which constitutes part of the database design, may
also be created in the same manner as described above.
The foregoing discussion in this chapter is divided into four sections:
Creating tables and relationships for accounting databases; Vouchers and
forms; information using queries and generating accounting reports.
15.2 Creating Tables and Relationships for Accounting Database
The database designed in of this chapter is to be discussed in the context of
database components as detailed above. This is because the implementation
of each database design is conditioned by its particular table structure and
interrelationships. Such implementation modalities have been discussed in
detail for various types of transaction vouchers already described in the
preceding chapter.
Accountancy
15.2.1 Database Design for Simple Transaction Vouchers
According to the design shown in figure 14.24 (Model-1) of preceding chapter,
there are five data tables: Employees, Accounts, Vouchers, Support and
AccountType. For the purpose of implementation, each table is described below
in terms of their storage structure, i.e. column names, data types and properties:
(a) AccountType : This table has two columns: CatId and Category.
CatId : This column of the AccountType table is meant to specify the
identification value of the category of accounts. Since there are limited
number of accounts type and are being expressed as numeric only,
the data type of this field can be safely taken as ‘Number/byte’ because
the storage space taken by the data type ‘Number/byte’ is minimum.
This field has been designated as primary key because it has unique
values across a set of category records.
Category : This field is meant to store the string of characters to express
the category of account such as Expenses, Revenues, Assets and
Liabilities. Its data type should be Text with suggested field size set to
15 characters.
(b) Accounts : This table has three columns: Code, Name and Type.
Code : A unique account number or code identifies an account. This
column is meant to store this code. Its data type is chosen as Text
because it is not to be subjected to any calculations. Its field size is
required to have a length of six characters because every account is
designed to have six digits at leaf level. Because of uniqueness in values,
this field is a good primary key field. The Allow Zero Length property
must be set to No. Indexed property of this field must be set to Yes (No
duplicates) to imply that the database creates automatically an internal
index on this field for fast retrieval of data records and No duplicates
indicates that this index is based on unique values of code.
Name : In a system of accounting, every account has a name. This
column is meant to store the name of an account corresponding to the
account code by which it is identified. Its data type is declared as Text
because it is a string of characters not required for any calculations.
Its field size need be set to 30 characters, which is considered to be
long enough to accommodate the name of account.
Type : Every account must belong to one of the accounts type as stored
in AccountType table. This field is a foreign key to reference CatId field
of AccountType table. Its data type and other properties must be the
same as that of CatId field in AccountType table, except that its Index
property can be set to YES (Duplicates OK).  This is because Type
value within accounts table cannot be unique as a number of accounts
might belong to a particular AccountType and store a common CatId
Accounting System using DBMS
as data value in Type field. The relationship between the CatId column
of AccountType table and type column of Accounts table must also be
defined so as to maintain referential integrity.
(c) Employees : This table stores the data pertaining to employees of the
organisation and is designed to have following columns :
EmpId : Each employee is identified by a unique data value called
EmpId, which in turn gets reflected in employee table as a column to
store for each employee record a unique identification value. The data
type of this column is text with field size equal to 4. Being a column to
store unique values and also because of its capability to identify an
employee record, it is designated as primary key field. Its Required
property is set to Yes and Zero length property is set to No with
Indexed property as Yes (No Duplicates).
Fname : This column refers to the first name of employee and its data
type is declared as Text because it is meant to store string of alphabets.
Its Field size is set to 10 on the assumption that first name of every
employee can be completely accommodated within this field size. The
Required property is set to Yes with Zero Length Property being No
to imply that every employee has a first name and no employee record
can be stored unless the first name is also stored.
Mname : Mname column is meant to store the middle name of an
employee. It data type is declared as text with field width equal to 10.
The Required Property can be set to No and Zero Length property to
Yes to imply that many employees may not have middle name.
Therefore, the storing of value in this field becomes optional.
Lname : Lname column has been included in the table structure to
store the Last name of an employee. The data type of this column is
Text with field size set to 10. The Required Property can be set to No
and Allow Zero Length property to Yes for the reason which applies
to Mname.
PhoneNo : This column is meant to store the Phone number of the
employee and its data type is set to Text with field size equal to 12.
The Required property is set to No with Allow Zero Length property
set to Yes to imply that null values are permitted for this field because
many employees may not have phone numbers.
SuperId : This column in the Employee table structure refers to EmpId
of the supervisor or immediate superior of the employee. Its data type
is set to Text with field width 4, the same as is for EmpId. Its Required
property is set to No with Allow Zero Length property being Yes to
imply that null values are also permitted. This is because the overall
boss of the organisation, although an employee, does not have any
Accountancy
boss and therefore a null value in this field is to be allowed to
accommodate the situation.
(d) Vouchers : This table has been designed to store the transaction data as
contained in a voucher. It has nine columns, the details of each are given
below :
Vno : This column is meant to store voucher number, which indicates
the distinct identity of a transaction. Its data type could be number if
numeric digits are assigned to each of the vouchers. However, its data
type is normally taken as text because it is amenable to any type of
numbering, coding or ordering scheme: numeric, alpha-numeric or
formatted reference. Its width may be set to 6 so that first 2 places to
the left refer to numeric month of the date and next 4 places to numeric
digits giving identity to each of the transactions that have occurred
during the month under reference. This column is designed to have
distinct values and therefore can be designated as primary key of the
table. Accordingly, its value cannot be null and therefore its Allow
Zero Length property must be set to No with Required property being
Yes. However, its data type needs be taken as number (with Integer),
when numeric function(s) such as Dmax() is applied to find maximum
values for auto-generating the vouchers.
Debit : This column is meant to store the code corresponding to an
account, which has been debited in recording a transaction. Since it
references the code column, which is the primary key of Accounts
table as described above, it is a foreign key column in Vouchers table.
The data type and properties of this column should be the same as
that of code column of Accounts table, except that its Indexed property
need be set to Yes Duplicates OK). The relationship between the code
column of accounts table and debit column of Vouchers table must
also be defined so as to maintain referential integrity.
Amount : This column is meant to store the amount of transaction and
is common to the accounts being debited and credited. Its data type
can be Number with field size set to double; format set to standard;
decimal places set to 2 and default value set to 0.00.  Alternatively, its
data type can be chosen as currency type, in that case its format can
be either accepted as currency or set to standard with decimal places
set to 2.
Vdate : This column of the table stores the date of transaction. Its data
type is set to Date/Time with format set to Medium Date (dd-MMM-
yy); Default value set to = Now() to imply current date in Real Time
Clock (RTC) of computer system and caption property set to Date.
Accounting System using DBMS
Credit : This column is meant to store the code corresponding to the
account being credited in recording a transaction. Like Debit column,
this column too shares the same properties as code column of Accounts
table and must also be dealt with in the same manner as Debit column
described above.
Narration : This column is meant to store the narration. Its data type
can be set to text type with field size set to 100 characters; Required to
No; Allow Zero Length to Yes and Indexed to No. If the narrations are
very large beyond 255 characters, its data type can be set to Memo so
as to accommodate the narrations up to 65,536 characters, almost
equal to 64 pages.
PrepBy : This column is meant to store the identity of an employee who
has prepared the voucher. EmpId as defined and described in schema
of Employees table identifies the employee. The data type of this field
and other properties must be identical to that of EmpId, except that its
Indexed property must be set to No. This column as per design is
expected to refer to EmpId column of Employees table and therefore
must be defined as foreign key. Its relationship with EmpId column of
Employees table must also be specified to ensure referential integrity.
AuthBy : This column is meant to store the identity of the employee
who has authorised the vouchers. This column is similar to PrepBy
column. Therefore, its data type, properties and relationship with EmpId
are the same as those for PrepBy column.
Support : This table is created to store the details of support documents
annexed to a voucher. It is designed to have the following four columns:
vNo : This column is meant to store the voucher number to which
this document is annexed. Its data type should be the same as that
of Vno in Vouchers table because this column refers to Vno column
of Vouchers table to maintain referential integrity. Its value cannot
be null and therefore its Allow Zero Length property must be set
to No with Required Property being Yes. Since there may be more
than one support documents annexed to a voucher, the values
stored in this column cannot be unique and therefore this column
alone cannot be a primary key field.
sNo : This column has been included in the table structure to store
serial numbers 1,2,3…  to correspond to the serial number of
documents being annexed. Duplicate values will occur in this field
also because the serial number of documents across the vouchers
shall be the same. However, both the columns: Svno and Sno
together provide a unique value because the documents, for every
voucher are serially numbered and therefore unique. Both the
Accountancy
columns together need be declared as Primary key of this table.
dName : This column refers to Document name. Its data type is
Text with field size equal to 30 to mean that within this character
limit the document name can be suitable accommodated.
sDate : This column refers to any date reference given in the support
document. Its data type is Date/Time. Its format can be declared
as Medium Date with Required and Indexed property set to No.
15.2.2 Modified Design for Implementing Compound Vouchers
There are two tables: VouchersMain and VouchersDetails
(a) VouchersMain : This table has been created to store one record for every
transaction. The rows of this table refer to those data items of the vouchers,
which lie outside the voucher grid. It consists of Vno, AccCode, vdate,
PrepBy, AuthBy and Type.
AccCode : This column is meant to store the complementing account
code, which in the context of debit voucher is credit account and in the
context of credit voucher is a debit account. In debit voucher, the debit
accounts are displayed in Debit Accounts Grid and therefore the
complementing account is the account to be credited. Similarly, in
Credit Voucher, the Credit Accounts Grid displays only the accounts,
which are being credited in recording a transaction. Therefore, the
complementing debit account need be stored in this column. This
column is also the foreign key column because it references the primary
key column of Accounts table. Its data type and properties must be
the same as that of Code column of Accounts table, except that its
Indexed property must be set to Yes (Duplicates OK) and the domain
of its data values is confined to the code values stored in Accounts
table.
Type : This column has been created to store a value 0 (for debit voucher)
or 1 (for credit voucher). Its data type therefore is set to Number with
field size set to byte. This column is very important and therefore its
values must be carefully stored and interpreted in preparing accounting
reports. Improper handling of this column may cause the Errors of
Principle in accounting. The data types and properties of Vno,Vdate,
AuthBy and PrepBy continues to be same as have been defined and
discussed in Vouchers table of Simple Vouchers Design. However, Vno
column has acquired an added importance because of being referenced
by Vno column of VouchersDetail table.
(b) VouchersDetail : This table is meant to store those data items of the voucher,
which appear in the grid of debit or credit vouchers. However, the Total
Accounting System using DBMS
amount of voucher is not stored because it is derived data. It consists
of Vno, Sno, Code, Amount and Narration as its columns.
Vno : This column is meant to store voucher number of Debit/
Credit record of VouchersMain table to which the Credit/Debit
entries of vouchersDetails table are related. Its data type should
be the same as that of Vno in VouchersMain table because this
column refers to Vno column of vouchersMain table to maintain
referential integrity. Its value cannot be null and therefore its
Allow Zero Length property must be set to No with Required
property being Yes. Since there can be more than one debit/credit
Entry against each of the credit/debit entry of  VoucherMain table,
the values stored in this column cannot be unique and therefore
this column alone cannot be a primary key field.
Sno : This column has been included in the table structure to
store serial numbers 1,2,3… to correspond to the serial number of
debit/credit entries being referred to in the grid of an accounting
Voucher: Debit or Credit. Duplicate values will occur in this field
also because the serial numbers of entries across the vouchers
are bound to be the same. However, both the columns: vno and
Sno together provide a unique value because for every voucher
the entries are serially numbered and therefore unique. Both the
columns together need be declared as primary key of this table.
Code : This column is meant to store the account codes, which in
the context of debit voucher are debit accounts and in the context
of credit voucher are credit accounts. This column is also the
foreign key column because it references the primary key column
of Accounts table. Its data type and properties must be the same
as that of Code column of Accounts table, except that its Indexed
property must be set to Yes (Duplicates OK). The domain of its
data values gets confined to the Code values stored in Accounts
table. The data type and properties of amount and narration
column continue to be the same as already described and
discussed for Vouchers table.
15.3 Vouchers Using Forms
The scope of this section includes the basics of Access for creating a
Form in Access; transforming the voucher designs in terms of Access
objects and properties; and also the procedure for creating Forms for
vouchers.
Accountancy
15.3.1 Access Basics for Creating Forms
A Form in Access may be designed, developed and used for the following
purposes :
Data Entry: Form is used for entering, editing and displaying data.
Application flow : Form is used for navigating through an application.
Custom Dialog Box : It can be used for providing messages to the user or
getting parameters from the user for executing a parameter-based query.
Printing information: It can be used for providing hard copies of data entry
information.
This is contrary to the belief that Forms in Access can be used only for
data entry. The most common use of a Form in Access is to display and edit
existing data and also for adding new data records.
15.3.2 Tool Box and Form Controls
A  tool box is a collection of visual objects (or controls) that are placed (or
embedded) on the Form to provide some meaning or functionality. The Form
is designed by placing several such controls, which have their own functionality
and properties.
15.3.3 Properties of Controls
Every form control is a complete object with its independent set of properties,
which determine the shape, size, behaviour and functionality of the object.
The properties of these objects are divided into three categories: Format, Data
and Others. All these properties may not apply to all the controls. Some
important properties of these objects are as described below :
(a) Format Properties : Some of the important properties are as described as
under:
Format : It determines the manner in which the data in the control is
displayed. This property is inherited from its underlying data source.
It is set and used in three situations : one when the property is not set
for the underlying field; second when the format setting of the underlying
field is to be overridden; third when a control, which is not bound to
any underlying data field, is to be displayed in a particular manner.
Decimal Places : This property specifies the number of decimal places
up to which the control should display a numeric data. It must be
used in conjunction with format property to determine the final
appearance of numeric data.
Caption : The caption property applies to label, command button and
toggle buttons. This property is used to specify what printed matter
will appear on the face of the control. In the context of label control,
the printed matter is made to appear using this caption property.
Accounting System using DBMS
Visible : This property specifies whether the control embedded on the
Form should be visible or hidden when the Form is opened. The property
can make a control appear conditionally when required.
Layout Properties (Left, Top, Width, Height) : These properties are used
to set the position and size of the control.
Back Colour and Style: The back colour property specifies background
colour, as opposed to text colour, for the control. This property, when
set to transparent, shows the form’s background colour through the
control. The setting is preferred for an Option group.
Special effects: This property provides the three dimensional effect to a
control in its appearance. The options for this property are: Flat, Raised,
Sunken, Etched, Shadowed and Chiseled. Each of these effects give a
different look to the control.
Border Properties(style, colour, and effect): The Border properties are
capable of affecting the style, colour and thickness of the Border of a
control. The Border style options are Transparent, Solid, Dashes, Dots,
etc. The Border  colour property specifies the  colour of the Border and
it is possible to select from a variety of  colours. The Border width
property can be set to one of several point sizes. When the Border style
of a control is set to transparent, its  colour and width properties are
ignored.
Fore Colour: This property can be used for assigning a  colour of choice
to the text being formatted.
Font Properties (Name, Size, Weight, Italics, Underline): These properties
are meant to control the appearance of text within a control. These are
capable of affecting font, its point size, thickness and also whether the
text is italicised or underlined.
Text Align : The text-align property affects the manner in which data is
aligned within the control. The available options are: General, Left,
Centre, Right and Distribute.
Margins (Top, Left, Right and Bottom) : These properties determine how
far the text appears from top, left, right and bottom of a control. The
margin properties are of particular importance while using Text box
for memo field.
Line Spacing: It is used to determine the spacing between the lines of a
text with multiple lines. This is useful when a text control is used for
displaying and storing data pertaining to Memo fields.
Display When: This property is capable of deciding whether to send the
data of a control to a Printer or to a Screen. For example, the labels
containing instructions can be displayed on the screen but not on the
printer.
Accountancy
Scroll Bars: This property is capable of determining whether scroll bars
appear when the data in the control does not fit within its size or not.
The options are none or vertical. This property is normally set to vertical
for text control to interact with data pertaining to Memo field.
(b) Data Properties
Control Source : This property specifies the field from a record source
that is associated with particular control. By default, it is the record
source that underlies the Form being designed.
Input Mask : The input mask property affects the format used for data
entry into the control as opposed to its appearance, which is affected
by Format and Decimal places property. The input mask of the field
underlying the control is automatically inherited by the control.
However, the input mask property of control in the Form is used to
further restrict what data is entered into the field.
Default Value : This property determines the value assigned to the field
while adding a new data record. It is inherited from the underlying
field of record source to which the control is bound. The default value,
when set for control, has an overriding effect over the default value set
at the underlying field level.
Validation (Rule and Text) : The function performed by Validation Rule
and Validation Text for controls is the same as it applies to Fields of
database tables, except that the validation is performed at Form level
in case of control and database level in case of fields. In case of bound
controls, the user cannot enter data into the control, if the validation
rules for control and the underlying field are in conflict.
Enabled and Locked : This property is meant to determine whether
focus is allowed on the control or not. If it is set to No, the control
appears dimmed and mouse action cannot be performed on such
control. This property is useful for calculated controls meant only for
display of data. Locked property determines whether the data in the
control can be modified or not. This property, when set to Yes, deprives
a user the facility to edit data, though the focus becomes available.
The two properties interact with one another resulting in following
behaviour of control :
Locked
Enabled
Effect : The  control can
get focus ; its data can be copied but not modified
get focus and its data can be modified
not get focus
not get focus; its data is displayed dimmed
Accounting System using DBMS
(c) Other Properties
Name : This property allows the designer to provide a customised name
to a control. The names assigned by the designer should be purpose
oriented so that the design structure of the Form becomes self-
documenting.
Status Bar Text : This control specifies the text message that is displayed
in the status bar when the control acquires the focus.
Enter Key Behaviour : This property is meant to determine whether the
use of Enter key adds a new line in the current control or results in
moving the  cursor  to next control. Its setting is useful for Text control
bound to Memo field.
Allow AutoCorrect : This property, when set to Yes, enables the auto
correction feature to correct automatically common spelling errors and
types. It is useful while using Text control for Memo field.
Vertical: This property is meant to determine whether the text in a
control appears horizontally or vertically. The default setting is  No to
mean the horizontal. When set to Yes, the text within the control is
rotated at 90 degrees.
Default : This property applies to command button and specifies whether
the control is a default control on the form or not.
Tab Stop : This property indicates whether the Tab key can be used to
enter a control or not. It is desirable to set this property to No for those
controls whose values are rarely changed.
Tab Index : This property is used to set the tab order for the control.
This property helps in setting the tab order manually as opposed to
automatic setting at Form level.
Short cut Menu : This control is capable of attaching a specific menu to
a control and a bar/window gets displayed when the user right-clicks
at the control.
Control Tip Text : This property is meant to enter text that acts as a
tool tip for the control. The tool tip appears automatically when the
mouse pointer is placed over the control and left there for a moment.
Help Context ID : This property indicates the Help topic attached to a
particular control.
15.3.4 Common Controls in MS Access
Access provides for a number of controls and more can be added using the
add-in-manager in Tools of menu bar. There are three types of controls: Bound,
unbound and calculated. Bound controls are used to display and modify data
stored in a data table of database. These controls automatically appear in the
Form specified in its display control property and inherit many of the properties
Accountancy
assigned to the field to which such controls are bound. Unbound controls
display information to the user or get data from user that is not going to be
stored in the database.  A Calculated control is a special type of control,
which displays the derived results of an expression or query. The expression
may consist of ready-to-use functions that are meant to make computations
by using input values. Some commonly used functions have been discussed
and described in Appendix given at the end of the chapter. Therefore, the data
in calculated control cannot be modified because it is derived data or
information. The value of these controls changes automatically as and when
the data, to which the expression of the control is bound, changes. Some of
the common controls important for designing a Form are discussed below :
(a) Label : This control is used to write dark prints on the Form such as
Transaction Voucher, Voucher No, S.No, Debit, Credit, Amount, Narration,
Authorised By, Prepared By on the left hand side and “Choose the Account
to Debited” and “Choose the account to be Credited “on the right hand
side of Access voucher Form design of which is shown in Fig 15.4. The
attached labels are automatically appended to the Form when other
controls such as Text boxes, List boxes, Combo boxes, etc. are added
because every such added control has to be labeled to inform the user as
to what data to enter or edit through the control. The default caption of
the label is the caption of the field that underlies the control to which it is
bound. If the caption property of the field is kept blank, the label caption
uses field name as its caption.
(b) Text Box : This control is included in a Form to provide a blank area for
entering the data with or without default values. Blank space next to
Amount label, for example, is a text box control to receive the value of
amount of voucher. Text box, when bound to a particular field of the table,
retrieves and displays the data stored in field for a particular row and is
capable of modifying and adding data to the table.  The unbound text box
is used to get the data from the user for its subsequent use in report for
providing report criteria.
(c) List Box : This control is used for allowing a user to make a limited choice
from a given set of values. The domain of its values is predefined and
therefore limited. List control may be used next to Debit and Credit labels
in a simple transaction voucher, so as to locate the accounts to be debited
or credited.
(d) Combo Box : This control combines the features of a list box and text box
by allowing a user to select an item from a list or enter a value using the
keyboard.
(e) Sub-form : Many Forms are based on more than one table with One-to-
Many relationship. The records of such tables can be displayed by creating
Accounting System using DBMS
form within a form, with tabular presentation of records. The Form within
a Form (also referred to as Main Form) is called SubForm. The Main Form
and SubForm have parent-child relationship. The Control used for creating
such a child Form is called SubForm/SubReport. Data records appearing
in a grid can be stored in database by using SubForm Control. The SubForm
whenever created is listed as an independent object like main form in
Database Window. However, the SubForm Control in main Form has three
properties for creating a link :
Source Object : It contains name of the Form that is being displayed in
SubForm control.
Link Child Fields : These are the fields from the Child form that link the
this form to the Main form. These are also referred to as Foreign key of
related table.
Link Master Fields : These are the fields from the Main Form that link
the Child form to the Main Form. These are also referred to as Primary
key of primary table. Make sure the Control Wizards tool is selected
before adding the SubForm/SubReport control to the Main form.
(f) Option Groups : Control, when applied to Option button, allows the designer
to select a particular option from out of a set of mutually exclusive options.
This option is useful in designing a common Voucher Form for Debit and
Credit Voucher for compound transactions.
(g) Command Button : It is meant to execute a defined action on the Form.
Access provides for six categories of command buttons as described below:
Record Navigation : The record navigation set of command buttons are
meant to facilitate pointer movement on data records. At a point of
time, only one row of a table, called data record, is accessed. To access
other rows, there has to be a pointer for causing record movement.
Record Operation : There are several operations on data records. These
are meant to facilitate such operations as add new record, delete record,
undo record, save record, duplicate and print record.
Form Operation : These operations are meant to be performed on the
entire form as an object. These are Open form, Close form, Print form,
Refresh form data and so on.
Report Operation : These operations are related to the report object.
Once a report is created, further actions, which can be taken on such
report are Mail report, Preview report, Print report and Send report to
file. Access provides separate command buttons for each of these
actions.
Application : There are five command buttons especially designed for
possible operations pertaining to other application programs. Run
application is meant to execute any existing program ; and Quit
Accountancy
application is used to stop the execution of a running application; Run
MS Excel command button is used for calling the MS Excel, spread
sheet program which is part of MS Office package. Similarly, a command
button to run MS Word results in calling the text processing program
of MS Office package; Run Note Pad command button when executed
calls the text writing program provided by the Operating System-
Windows.
Miscellaneous : This category include four command buttons: Auto
dialer; Run query, Run macro, Print table. Auto dialer button in a form
when clicked is capable of dialing a telephone number, provided a
modem is attached and configured in the computer system. Run query
command button is meant to execute an existing query. Run macro
command button is used to execute a specified Macro and Print table
command button, when clicked is capable of printing contents of a
specified data table from among available tables in database.
In the example of Access Voucher Form shown in Fig 15.4, four command
buttons have been embedded. First button when clicked adds a Record while
a click action on the second button results in undoing the record. The third
command button is meant to delete a record and the fourth button when
clicked saves the record to back-end database tables while in this case it is
Vouchers table as already described.
(h) Control Wizard : If the selected controls (such as List box, combo box or
SubForm) when added to the Form do not invoke the automated wizard,
the control wizard need be selected by click action before selecting the
control which is to be embedded on the Form for design purposes.
15.3.5 Creation of Form
Access provides for creation of a Form either by Design or Wizard. This can be
achieved by double clicking at the database file. Immediately the Database
Window appears, which is vertically divided into two parts: left and right. The
left side displays a list of database objects such as Tables, Queries, Forms,
Reports, Pages, Macros and Modules. The right hand side of Database Window
shows the various objects created under each of the classes of objects. At the
top of Database Window and just below the title bar, there is a menu bar,
which consists of three named menu items: Open, Design and New, and five
Icons: one to delete an object, second and third to toggle between Large and
Small (default) Icons and fourth and fifth to toggle between list (default) and
details.
Select Forms Object : This can achieved by a click at Forms listed as object-
class. By default, two items appear on the right side of window: “Create Form
in design view” and “Create Form by using wizard”.
Accounting System using DBMS
Fig. 15.2 : Database window showing the methods to create forms
(a) Create Form by using wizard : The following procedure is followed for using
the wizard to create a data entry Form :
Double click at Create Form by using wizard. Immediately there is a
window titled, Form Wizard  which allows the designer to choose the
data table along with the related available fields to choose from. The
designer should choose only those fields, which pertain to the data
content of Form being designed. But it must be ensured that every
essential field (defined as one with Required property set to Yes and
Allow Zero Length property set to No) must be included. In case of
voucher, choose all the fields by clicking at >> button.
Click at Next command button. Form wizard responds by providing
six mutually exclusive choices with respect to layout of the Form. One
of these choices is exercised by clicking at an option button from a
group of six such buttons.
Accountancy
Click at Next command button after exercising layout choice. The Form
wizard responds by prompting the user to select from a list control one
out of the ten options to specify the style of presentation of this Form.
Click at Next to move forward. Access responds by asking for the Title
of the Form. The designer can provide a useful title, which explains the
purpose for which the Form is being created. Further, the designer
may specify whether the Form is to be opened for entering data or for
modifying the design.
Finally click at Finish command button to get the initial design of the
Form in run mode, if the option for entering data is exercised. If the
option for modify design is exercised, the design of the Form is available
along with tool box with various controls to facilitate modification of
design.
Modifying Form Design : The Forms created with wizard have limited visual
appeal. However, Forms have a design view, just as table do, and Access
includes many tools for modifying a Form’s design. Some of the common
modifications to the Form are listed below :
Changing Properties of controls
Re-sizing and moving controls
Aligning and spacing controls
Converting (or Morphing) controls
Conditional formatting of controls
Re-arranging Tab Order
Adding New controls
Deleting existing controls
Each of these modifications has been briefly discussed after describing
the procedure for creating a Form by Design view.
(b) Create Form by Design view : Under this method, a data entry Form is
created either as a data bound object or as an unbound object. A double
click at “Create Form in Design View” provides a New Form dialog but the
Form created in this manner is not bound to any back end database.
However, a click at New to open New Form dialog results in creating the
Form, which is bound to database. The use of drop down list in the new
Form dialog box to select a table or query serves as the foundation of the
Form being created. Fields can be easily added to a Form by using the
Field List window, which contains all the fields that are part of the Form’s
record source. The record source for the Form is the table or query that
underlies the Form. Make sure that the Field List window is visible. If it is
not, click at the Field List button on the tool bar. Pick up from the field list
every field, which is to be displayed in the Form for entering the data. It is
important to ensure that every essential field must appear in the Form, if
Accounting System using DBMS
the Form is being designed to enter records rather than displaying just
part of record contents. Select and drag the field from the field list to a
place on the Form where it is desired to appear. The location selected
becomes the upper left corner of the text box, and the attached label appears
to the left of where the text control is dropped. Further, the following steps
are taken to develop a data entry Form :
Click at New to open the New Form dialog. Two list controls appear
in the dialog box : one provides for various options to create a Form
such as Design view, Form Wizard, Auto Form; etc. and another to
“choose the table or query where object’s data comes from” (also
called record source). From First List  control choose Design
view(default) by a click.
Choose a table as the record source because the entire data is stored
in the table record by record. Click OK after the table is selected.
(iii)
Access responds by providing three windows : one for new blank
Form, second for tool box and third for Field list corresponding to
the selected record source. The Form object henceforth shall act as
a container for other controls to be used in designing Form.
Select and drag a field from the Field list and place it in the blank
Form by drag and drop method. Repeat this process for every field
in succession.  Alternatively, all the fields can be selected by clicking
at every field in the field list while Ctrl Key is kept pressed. The
selected fields can be dragged and dropped at the Voucher Form.
Adding a Title : The Form must be suitably titled for its identity,
which should be self-descriptive. To add a title, use tool box by
clicking at the label control. While the pointer is moved back into
the design area, it changes to a large letter A with crosshairs.
Move the pointer into the header area and click where the label is
desired to be placed and then type the text of title. Once the text is
entered, the focus from the label control can be freed by clicking
anywhere in the Form. The label can be reselected by a click, followed
by using the formatting tool bar to format the title. Alternatively
and in addition to the above, more formatting options can be
exercised by right clicking at the label control and clicking at
Properties item of drop down window of right click action.
Changing the Properties of Forms and Controls : Every Access object:
Form or Controls is described by its properties. These properties,
as already stated above, have been classified into three broad
categories: Format, Data and Others. It is not essential to know
every available property to work well in designing Forms in Access.
But it is always good idea to check up the property values if the
object is not behaving the way it is expected to. To view the properties
Accountancy
for an object or control, right click at the control and select the
properties. Access responds by providing all the properties listed
under category tabs. The property sheet title bar includes names of
objects contained in the Form. Once property sheet is opened for
one object, it is easy to call for the properties of other objects by
selecting the name of object from property sheet title bar. The values
of such properties are changed as desired. The Form’s property
sheet can be opened by double-click at Form selector, which is
located at the left most intersection of vertical and horizontal rulers.
The property setting on multiple controls can be changed at the
same time by selecting multiple objects, in which case only those
properties become available for editing which are common to the
selected objects. The multiple objects can be selected by keeping
the Shift Key pressed, followed by clicking at desired objects.
(vii)
Moving and Resising controls : In order to move a control, first select
it by a click action, then move the pointer to the edge of the selected
control, ensuring that any of the re-sizing handles appearing as
bold dot is not pointed at directly. The pointer turns its shape to a
small hand. At this stage, hold mouse button pressed and drag the
control to its new location. Movement of control beyond the bottom
or right edge of the Form, leads to increasing the Form area
automatically. Access also allows for combining of select and move
step thereby making it easier and more efficient to reposition the
control. A control can be re-sized by dragging the re-sizing handles
at the corners and sides of the object.  A change in the size of text
control, however, does not result in changing the size of its
underlying field because the size of the field is specified in table’s
design and can be changed only by modifying the properties of the
field in table design.
(viii)
Aligning and Spacing Controls : Select two or more controls (click at
control to be selected by holding the Shift Key pressed) to be aligned
and choose Format-align or right click and choose Align from the
shortcut menu to open the list of alignment options. Align-Left leads
to aligning the left edges of all the selected controls; Align-Right aligns
the right edges of the control. To adjust controls on the same
horizontal line, Align-Top or Bottom options can be used. Spacing of
controls allows to change (increase or decrease)  the relative position
of selected controls by one grid point horizontally or vertically. The
spacing becomes important when the controls are to be spread out
or move closer together for a neater visual layout. Spacing can also
be used for ensuring that the controls are evenly spaced.
Accounting System using DBMS
Converting (or Morphing) Controls : Initially, when a Form is built, it
is not always possible to choose the best type of controls to display
each field on the Form. One might make a choice for the control
only to find out later that it does not suit to the requirements. This
is particularly important when the initial design of a Form is created
using Form wizard. Access provides for conversion (or morphing) of
such control into the desired ones. One of the most common types
of morphing is from text to List box or combo box. This is achieved
by right click on the text box, followed by choosing Change To and
selecting the type of control to into which text box is to be morphed.
Every control cannot be morphed into every other type of control.
Text box, for instance, can be converted into a label, list box or
combo box. After morphing, a text box to list box, for instance, it is
important to modify the control properties such as row source,
bound column, column count and column width so that the changed
control behaves in a desired manner.
Conditional formatting of text boxes : The conditional formatting is
displayed in a text control when the value of text control meets a
specified criteria or a set of specified criterion. For example, the
colour of Amount entered should turn Red when it exceeds a
certain limit say Rs. 20,000. In order to create conditional format,
right click at text box to be conditionally formatted when in design
mode, followed by conditional formatting item of right click window.
Access responds by providing conditional formatting window which
appears as follows : Conditional formatting window, as shown above,
is divided into two parts: the default setting and condition-1.  Since
the formatting is to occur on the basis of a field value, the criteria
list control can be used to select greater than and Rs. 20,000 is
entered in the right most box of condtion-1. There are five icons:
bold, Italics, underline, Back  colour and Fore  colour for formatting
the data value. As and when the condition is satisfied, the formatting
based on the selected icons applies to the data value. If there are
multiple conditions for formatting, Add button can be clicked to call
for additional formatting conditions. At the most three conditions
can be set up for conditional formatting.  Click OK to apply the
conditions and click Delete to remove the conditional format.
Re-arranging the Tab Order : The tab order of the Form (defined as
a sequence of controls to move through when pressing a tab) is
assigned while creating a Form. The tab order goes out of sequence
when the controls in the Form are re-arranged. An inconsistent
tab order leads to an erroneous data entry. To change the tab order,
choose View-Tab order or right click and choose tab order to open
Accountancy
Tab Order dialog box. Clicking Auto Order generally rearranges
the fields in the correct order. It is preferable to try this option first.
If the auto order is not correct, the tab order can be set manually
by clicking the row selector for a control and then dragging the
control up or down into position in the Tab Order.

15.3.6 Procedure for Creating Voucher Forms
On the basis of above discussion, the following procedure can be followed to
create the different types of vouchers :
(a) Simple Transaction Voucher : The transaction data of simple accounting
vouchers is required to be stored in the Vouchers table of a database by
using a data entry Form in Access. The format of such a form is shown in
figure 15.4.
Accounting System using DBMS
Fig. 15.4 : Transaction voucher, using database design (model-I)
The above voucher form uses database design (Model-I) at the backend. A
perusal of the this voucher Form reveals that there are two parts: Left and
Right separated by a dark vertical line. Left part is dedicated to the data
entry of transaction data while the right part has two list controls: one
each giving the accounts to be debited and credited. The pre-printed
contents of simple transaction voucher appear to the left of above Form as
bold dark words. The access resource required to display such pre-printed
matter is label control. The data entry spaces against Voucher Number,
Dated, Amount and Narration are Text Controls. The list controls have
been deployed against Debit Account, Credit Account, Prepared By and
Authorised By. The Title of the Voucher Form has been written by using
the Label Control. Four operation buttons called Command Buttons control
the data entry into the voucher Form. On the Right hand side of above
voucher Form, the list controls have been used in expanded Form to choose
debit and credit accounts. The resources used in creation of above voucher
Accountancy
Form, therefore, consist of Labels, Texts, List controls and Command
Buttons. Once a blank Form is picked up like a container, it is capable of
containing these controls including command buttons. The following steps
are required for creating the Simple Transaction Voucher as per the Access
design given above.
Once the Database Window is opened and Forms object is selected,
click at New item of menu bar. Access responds by displaying a
New Form window in which design view option among others
appears by default along with a list control to select a table or
query which is to act as underlying data source for the voucher
being designed. In designing Simple voucher Form, it is fairly clear
that the data entered using this voucher Form is to be stored only
in the Vouchers table.
Choose Vouchers table, which has been designed to include the
transaction data in each row as a stand-alone record and click OK.
(iii)
Access responds by displaying a blank Form object in Form window,
along with two other windows: Tool box and Field List of Vouchers
table. Expand this Form towards the right and divide it into two parts
left and right using line controls of tool box say in the ratio of 3:1.
Keep the Ctrl Key pressed and click at every field in Field List
Vouchers window. The  colour of the list of fields turns blue.
Press at the selected field’s area and drag all the fields to left side of
blank Form on which data entry contents of voucher are to be
located. It may be noted that every data entry control has been
assigned to its left an attached label control whose caption is the
caption of the fields in Vouchers table.
Re-position all the controls to their desired location in the left part
of the Form and set the font weight property of each to bold. The
caption property of each label can be modified to match the pre-
printed layout of the voucher.
(vii)
Click at label control in tool box and add it to the centre top of left-
hand side of the Form to add the title: Transaction Voucher. Its
font size property need be set to 16 with font weight set to bold. Set
the fore  colour to Blue.
(viii)
Paste another text box anywhere in the Form and set its Control
Source property as =Val(DMax(“Vno”,”Voucher”))+1 and Visible
property to No. Further, Set Default value property of Text Box to
the left of label Voucher No. as =Val(DMax(“Vno”,”Voucher”))+1.
This ensures that the text control generates a new value one more
than the preceding value of last voucher number entered in Vouchers
table, as and when a new record is added. As a result, the voucher
Accounting System using DBMS
number is detected in Vouchers table and incremented by one to
auto generate the voucher number sequentially. Further, set the
Enabled property to No so that the auto generated value is not
amenable to any changes by the user.
Set Default value of Text box meant for entering the voucher date
as = Now(). This results in giving current RTC date as the default
date to voucher as and when a new voucher record is added.
Alternatively, click at More Control button in  tool box to select
Microsoft Data and Time Picker Control, Version 6. This control
provides a user-friendly and interactive method of selecting a date.
Set the format property of this control to “3-dpt custom” and
custom-Format property to “dd-MMM-yy” by using DT Picker
properties dialog. Control source of this control is set to vdate so
that the selected date is stored directly into this field.
Set the format property of Text box meant for Amount to Standard
with decimal places to 2. This ensures the appearance of amount up
to two decimal places with standard punctuation of numeric values.
Provide for conditional formatting of amount so that its  colour
turns red as and when an expense voucher exceeding Rs. 20,000 is
not authorised by an employee whose EmpId =’A001’. This can be
achieved by a right click at text box for amount to click at conditional
formatting. A conditional formatting dialog appears in which
condition-1 is to be given as “Field value greater than Rs. 20,000”
interactively. Click Add button to provide condition-2 as Expression
is [AuthBy]<>’A001’ and [Debit] like ‘71*’. Click  colour icon to
select red  colour in condition-2. Click OK to close the conditional
formatting dialog.
(xii)
Control morphing from Text box to List box is to be applied on
four-text control, each one meant to store Debit, Credit, AuthBy
and PrepBy. This can be achieved by right click at each of these
controls one by one and click at Change To item of right click
window. To begin with, select List Box option for text box next to
Label Debit. Height of text box is expanded. Re-size, it to its original
shape and right click to select the property window. Select Data
properties button to provide the Row Source as Account table. Click
at format properties button to set the column count property to 2
and column width property to 0.5". Ensure that the width property
of list control for debit is set to a minimum of 1.75” to accommodate
the code as well as Name of Account in a row of list control. The
process can be repeated for Text boxes next to Credit. Text controls
meant for AuthBy and PrepBy can also be morphed into List Box
Accountancy
controls in a similar way, except that the Row Source Property
should be Set to Employees table and Column width be set to .33”
only because Empl_Id occupies only four text spaces as opposed to
Account code, which need six spaces. Width property of these list
controls can be suitably adjusted to accommodate both EmpId and
Fname of employees authorising or preparing a voucher.
(xiii)
Paste List Controls for selecting debit and credit Accounts on the
Right Hand Side (RHS) of Voucher Form. Following steps are taken
to accomplish this :
Click at list box control available in  tool box and carry the
mouse pointer to the right side of the Form. Its shape will turn
into a cross with icon of list control. Place it at the top of right
part of the Form. Access responds by invoking List Box Wizard,
which provides for three options to choose the look up values.
By default, the wizard provides for choosing look up values from
table or query.
Click at Next button to get the classified list of tables and queries
to choose from. At this stage, choose the Accounts table because
domain of accounts to be debited or credited remains confined
to accounts available in Accounts table only.
Click at Next button to get the available fields of Accounts table:
Code, Name and Type. Select Code and Name by clicking at >
button.
Click at Next to get a list of accounts with key column hidden.
Uncheck the already checked box to display the key column
also in list control.
Click at Next to get an option to select code to store in database.
Clicking at Next provides two options: One to remember the value
for later use and second to store that value in this field. Choose
second option and select the debit field to the right of this option
as the column against which the key value of accounts from list
control is to be stored.
Repeat the above process to provide for a list control for Account
to be Credited.
Once both the List box controls for debit and credit entries have
been pasted, change the caption property of labels attached to
such List boxes and write the text “Choose the Account to be
Debited” for first list box and “Choose the Account to be Credited”
for second. Set the Font weight property to bold, the fore  colour
to red and green respectively to distinguish between debit and
credit list control and re-size the label control by increasing its
width to accommodate the text to caption of label. Re-size the
Accounting System using DBMS
list boxes to adjust their width and height appropriately. This
can be achieved by right clicking at each of the controls to get
the property windows.
(xiv)
Click at Command button in Tool Box and carry the mouse pointer to
Area at the bottom of Left most bottom corner of the Voucher Form. Its
shape turns into a cross with command button icon. Paste it by horizontal
and vertical dragging to give suitable width and height. Immediately, the
Command Button wizard is invoked to seek information about category
of operation and the action to be performed using this command button.
Choose Record operation as category with Add New Record as the action.
Click at Next to state whether the caption of the command button is to
be a text value or an icon. A click at next after appropriate selection
results in giving a suitable object name to the command button. Accept
the default value and click at finish. This results in pasting an operational
button on the Form with the capability to add a new record.
Repeat this action to create various other command buttons to
match the design of Transaction Voucher Form given above.
(b) Compound Transaction Voucher : The transaction data of Debit or Credit
vouchers, which have already been described as compound transaction
vouchers, is required to be stored in VouchersMain and VouchersDetails
tables of database. Its design, when transformed in Access Form layout,
is expected to appear in the following format :
A perusal of the above Access Form for Credit Voucher reveals that
there are four labels: Voucher No, Date, Prepared By and Authorised By in
Dark bold letters. These labels are meant to define the pre-printed content
of the voucher as per design. Next to first two labels: Voucher No. and
Date are text boxes displaying their respective data contents. To the right
of labels Authorised By and Prepared By are List Box controls to get and
display the first name of employees.  Text Box displays the Title of the
Voucher Form Credit Voucher as calculated control because the same
voucher design is used for Debit vouchers also. Just below this dynamic
title is the Option group control whereby the user can make a mutually
exclusive choice for Debit or Credit Voucher. The title of Entries Grid and
Text box to the left of a list control are used to select an account to be
debited or credited (the complementing account) against the accounts being
mentioned in the Entries Grid are also calculated text controls. The
calculated text controls acquire the text value to display on the basis of
what is selected in the Option groups. Next to calculated text box control
is a label to print an instruction for refreshing the display in grid. The grid
consists of five columns: S.No, Code, Name of Account, Amount and
Narration. The grid appears in the voucher by using SubForm control.
Besides this, there are five command buttons, each dedicated to Add
Accountancy
Record, Undo Record, Delete Record, Save Record and Close. These
command buttons operate on the data entry Form.
Fig. 15.5 : Credit voucher created as a form in access
To create this voucher Form, following steps are taken using design view :
Create a blank form in design view and ensure that its underlying
data source is selected as VouchersMain table and Field List window
along with  tool box is also displayed. As already discussed in Section
I of this chapter, the Compound Voucher Form requires another related
data table, VouchersDetail, for storing the data contents of grid.
Keep the Ctrl key pressed and click at Vno,Vdate, AuthBy and
PrepBy fields in Field List window.
(iii)
Press at any of the selected field’s area, drag and drop it to blank
Form. It can be observed that all the selected fields are also dragged
and dropped along with this field.
Re-position all the controls to their desired location in the Form and
set the font weight property of each to bold. The caption property of
each label can be modified to match the pre-printed layout of the voucher.
Accounting System using DBMS
Paste Option group control just below the form space meant for dynamic
title. Access responds by prompting the user to enter the label names
for each option. Enter two options by writing Debit and Credit in different
rows. This must be followed by a click at Next button.
Option group wizard responds by prompting the designer to enter
the default option.
(vii)
Select Debit so that by default, the compound voucher is a Debit
Voucher. Click at Next button. Access responds by prompting the
designer to enter the data values corresponding to each of the option
labels. Enter against Debit and Credit 0 and 1 respectively. Click
Next button.
(viii)
Access Responds by requiring the user to either opt for Save the
value for Later Use or Save the value in this Field. Choose the
second option for Save the value and select Vno as Type field.
Click at Next button.
Access responds by asking the designer to choose the appropriate
control type. Choose Option buttons, along with any of the styles
given below in wizard dialog. Click Finish button. Access assigns a
default label to the Option group. Select the label by right clicks
and remove it by clicking at Cut.
Click at text control in  tool box and add it to the centre top of   the
Form to provide a dynamic text for  the title: Debit or Credit Voucher.
The attached label control is removed by a right click on this label
followed by a click on Cut. The font size property of Text need be set to
16 with font weight set to bold. Set the fore  colour to Blue. Set its
Control Source property as = IIF([Type] = 0,”Debit”,”Credit”) & “ “ &
“Voucher” Re-size the width of this text control so that it can
accommodate and display the dynamic title of voucher. By entering the
above formulae in Control Source property, text control for title becomes
dynamic. Whenever, the Type field is assigned 0 value, a text control for
title displays Debit Voucher and when the value of Type is set to 1, the
Credit Voucher is displayed by the this Text control. The title of simple
Transaction Voucher is static. Therefore, a label control has been used
for this purpose. Further, set the Enabled property to No so that the
displayed text is not amendable to any changes by the user.  This
applies to other similar controls meant for dynamic texts in this Voucher
Form.
Paste another text box anywhere in the Form and set its Control
Source Property as = Val(DMax(“Vno”,”Voucher”)) + 1 and Visible
property to No. Further, Set Default value property of Text box to
the left of label Voucher No. as =Val(DMax(“Vno”,”Voucher”))+1.
This ensures that the text control generates a new value one more
Accountancy
than the preceding value of the last voucher number entered in
vouchers table as and when a new record is added. As a result, the
voucher number is detected in Voucher table and incremented by
one to auto generate the voucher number sequentially. Set its
Enabled property to No for reasons already explained earlier.
(xii)
Set Default value of Text box meant for entering the voucher date
as = Now(). This results in displaying RTC date as the default date
to voucher as and when a new voucher record is added.
(xiii)
Paste another text control below, the label Voucher No: to indicate
Debit in case of Credit voucher and Credit in case of Debit Voucher.
Remove its attached label and set its Font size and font weight
property appropriately. However, its Control Source property is set
as = IIF([Type] = 0,”Credit”,”Debit”) so that this text box displays
the desired text as stated above. Pick up a List control from tool box
and place it next to this calculated text control to choose the account.
Immediately, the List control wizard gets activated and displayed.
Complete the list control creation process as already discussed while
designing the simple transaction form. Ensure that its Control source
property is assigned the Field name AccCode; Row Source to
Accounts; Column Count set to 2; Bound Column set to 1 and
Column width to 0.5". Re-size the control for proper display.
Creating Grid for Debit/Credit Entries : The grid for entries is created by using
SubForm Control. Following steps are taken to create SubForm to be linked
to Main Voucher Form :
(i) Pick and paste SubForm control for creating a grid to accommodate the
Debit/Credit Entries. SubForm wizard gets activated and displayed.
Choose existing Tables/Queries, followed by click at Next button.
Subform wizard displays a dialog to giving fields classified by their
respective tables. Choose Sno, Code from VouchersDetail table; Name
from Accounts table; again Amount, narration and Vno from
VouchersDetail table. Click Next button.
(ii) Choose “Show VoucherDetail for each record in VouchersMain using
Vno” and Click Next and provide the name for subform object as
“VouchersDetail SubForm” Click at Finish. The SubForm stands created
to accommodate the data contents in voucher grid. The attached label
of SubForm is removed to pave the way for creating dynamic title. This
is achieved by adding another text control (remove the attached label
control) at the top of the SubForm in the same manner as applies to the
title of voucher, except that the Control Source property is set to =
IIF([Type] = 0,”Debit”,”Credit”) & “ “ & “Entries”. This calculated
control is capable of showing the title of the grid as Debit Entries or
Credit Entries, depending on choice of Option button at run time.
Accounting System using DBMS
The Voucher number column in grid can be hidden by merging its right
most vertical line with vertical line separating narration and voucher
number column by drag and drop method.
(iii) Set the format property of Text box meant for Amount to Standard
with decimal places to 2. This ensures the appearance of amount up to
two decimal places with standard punctuation of numeric values.
(iv) Provide conditional formatting of amount so that its  colour turns ino red
as and when an expense voucher exceeding Rs. 20,000 is not authorised
by an employee whose EmpId =’A001’. This is achieved by a right click at
text box for amount to get short-cut window so that conditional formatting
item is selected. A conditional formatting dialog appears in which condition-
1 is to be given as “Field value greater than Rs. 20,000” interactively. Click
Add button to provide condition-2 as Expression is [AuthBy]<>’A001’ and
[Debit] like ‘71*’. Click  colour icon to select Red  colour in condition-2.
Click OK to close the conditional formatting dialog.
(v) Text control for entering Code in SubForm can be morphed to List control
in the same manner as already explained for Debit/Credit Account in
simple Transaction Voucher except that the Control source property is
assigned the Field name Code of VouchersDetail Table.
(vi) Control morphing from Text box to List box is also to be applied on text
controls meant to store the data values for AuthBy and PrepBy
respectively. This can be achieved in the manner as already described
in the context of designing a simple Transaction Voucher.
(vii) Paste a label control to the top right of SubForm for displaying  the
instruction “Press F9 to Refresh Display”.
(viii) Command button at the bottom of Debit/Credit Voucher Form can be
added in the same manner as described above in the context of Simple
Transaction Form. An additional Command button with Caption Close
Form can be added by choosing Form Operation as category with Close
Form as the action.
While operating on the above form in run mode, it must be ensured by the
user that the entries in the grid are made only after saving the data contents
of voucher outside the grid. This is because a data record for contents outside
the grid belongs to VouchersMain table. Such record in primary table must
exist before any data record is entered in grid to be finally stored in
VouchersDetail table.
15.4 Information Using Queries
Accounting information that is presented in an accounting report is generated
by creating and executing various queries using DBMS. The basics of creating
such queries in MS Access have been described below along with their usage
in the context of Model-1.
Accountancy
15.4.1 Basics of Creating Queries in Access
Recall that one of the great advantages of relational databases is that the
fragmented data is stored in different data tables so that there is no or minimum
redundancy. But a complete view of data stored across various tables is
achieved only by executing queries based on SQL. A query is capable of
displaying records containing fields from across a number of data tables.
15.4.2 Types of Queries
There are several types of queries in Access that are used to generate
information. Such queries are called select queries because they are used to
“select” records with a given set of fields: actual and computed and also for a
given criteria. There are three important query types that are required for
generating the accounting reports. These queries have been discussed as below:
(a) Simple Query : A select query is a simple query if it does not involve use of
any query function to produce a summary of data. The criteria, if any,
used in such a query is based on some constant value or values, forming
an integral part of the query.  For example, a query, to find date and
amount of transactions records in which an account, identified by code =
’711001’ is debited, is a simple query and is executed, using database
design of Model-I by the following SQL statement :
SELECT vDate, Amount
FROM Vouchers
WHERE Debit = ’711001’
In the above SQL statement, the SELECT statement is meant to specify
the fields to be selected, FROM clause specifies the source of data and
WHERE clause filters the records matching the condition that Debit field
has code = ’711001’
(b) Parameter Queries : A parameter query prompts the user to enter
parameters, or criteria through an input box, for selecting a set of records.
A parameter query is useful when there is a need to repeat the same query
with different criteria. The criteria, this means, is not constant as in the
case of the simple query. While extracting the transactions to prepare
ledger accounts, the same set of queries need be executed for different
account codes. Consider the following SQL statement :
PARAMETERS AccountName Text (255)
SELECT Name
FROM Accounts
WHERE Code = AccountNo
Accounting System using DBMS
In the above query, the PARAMETERS clause is meant to declare the
variable AccountNo. This SQL statement, when executed, prompts the
user to provide the value of AccountNo.
(c) Summary Queries : A summary query, as opposed to a simple query, is
used to extract aggregate of data items for a group of records rather than
a detailed set of records. This query type is of particular importance in
accounting because the accounting reports are based on summarisation
of transaction data. Consider the following SQL statement :
SELECT Code, Name, Sum(Amount)
From Vouchers INNER JOIN Accounts
ON (Accounts.Code=Vouchers.Debit)
GROUP BY Code, Name
In the above query, the Vouchers table has been joined with Accounts table
on the basis of Code field of Accounts and Debit field of Vouchers. The resultant
record set has been grouped on the basis of Code and name of accounts.
Accordingly, the sum of amount for each group (or set of records) has been
ascertained and displayed. Finding the sum is the process of summarisation.
15.4.3 Adding Computed fields
The computed fields, representing secondary data, do not form part of data
stored in tables because such data items unnecessarily increase the size of
database. The secondary data items can always be generated on the basis of
primary (or stored) data. In order to find values of such secondary data items,
the query is based on computed fields. The computed fields provide up-to-
date calculated results because they rely upon updated stored data values.
For example, a data table, named Sales, which includes ItemCode, Quantity,
Price, Dated and CustId, is maintained in a database to store sales
transactions. In order to get list of sales transactions along with total sales
relating to CustId=’A051', the following simple query is executed by including
Sales as computed field :
SELECT  Dated, ItemCode, Quantity*Price AS Sales
FROM Sales WHERE CustId= ‘A051’;
In the above query the expression Quantity*Price has been given the name
Sales by using AS clause.
15.4.4 Using Functions in Queries
A function in the Access environment is named and followed by parenthesis
( ). The function receives some inputs as its arguments and returns a value
(also called its output). These functions also form a part of the expression for
a computed field. Some commonly used functions have been described and
discussed in Appendix given at the end of the chapter.
Accountancy
15.4.5 Methods of Creating Query
There are three ways in which any of the above queries can be created in
Access. These methods are Wizard, Design and SQL View. A brief description
of each is given below :
(a) Wizard Method : In order to create a query using Wizard, the following
steps are required :
(i) Select Queries from Objects list given in LHS (Left Hand Side) of
Database window.
(ii) Double click at Create Query by Using Wizard given on the RHS
(Right Hand Side). Immediately, there is a window titled ‘Simple Query
Wizard’ (Shown in figure: 14.6) that prompts the user to select a
field from a table or an existing query that is to be included in the
query being created. Many such fields may be selected according to
the information requirement of the query. The tables (or queries)
Fig. 15.6 : Window to display simple query wizard
Accounting System using DBMS
being chosen represent the data source of the query being created.
The fields being selected imply the data items to be displayed by the
query. Use arrow buttons or double click at the  list of fields on LHS
of this window to select fields.
(iii) Click at Next after the desired fields have been selected. If the selected
fields include a number or currency field, the designer is prompted
to choose an option button to specify whether the query to be created
is a summary or detail query.
If detail option is chosen, the execution of query results in
displaying records from data source.
If summary option is selected, the user is prompted to indicate
the type of summarisation required: Sum, Average, Minimum
and Maximum with respect to the field of summarisation. Clicking
at check boxes against different types of summarisations specifies
this. Click OK.
(iv) Click at Next and specify the name of the query being created %
Finish to save and execute the query. The results of the query are
displayed in datasheet view.
(b) Design Method : In order to create a query by design method, the following
steps are required :
(i) Select Queries from Objects list given in LHS of database window.
Double click at Create Query by Using Design View given on the
(ii) Access responds by displaying a Select Query and Show Tables
Window. The Select query window is vertically divided into two panes:
upper pane and lower pane, as shown in Figure: 15.7. The upper
pane is meant to display data sources (Tables or Existing Queries)
and the lower pane, which also called Query By Example (QBE)
grid, has one column each for field to be included in query being
created. The row of this grid shows field name, table (or query), sort
order, whether the selected field is shown in the query results or not
and also the criteria that have been applied to the field or fields to
restrict the query results. The Show Table Window is meant to add
tables, queries or both to the upper pane of Select Query Window. If
closed, the Show Table Window can be recalled by a right click at
upper pane % show table.
Accountancy
Fig. 15.7 : Select query and show tables windows
(iii) Click at View item of Menu bar % Total and then % Table Names.
(iv) Click at field row of first column of QBE grid to select the fields to be
included in the query. The process is repeated for second and
subsequent columns of grid to include more fields in the query. This
process of selection constitutes the data items to be displayed by
SELECT clause of SQL statement.
(v) The name of table or query is displayed, in accordance with selection
of fields. Such tables or queries constitute the data sources shown
after FROM clause of SQL statement. However, the initial selection
of a table/query in the second row of QBE grid restricts the choice
of fields to the selected table/query only.
(vi) Click at row of grid to specify the Group by clause and aggregate
functions so that summary a query is created.
Accounting System using DBMS
(vii) Click at row of grid to specify the sort order (Ascending or descending)
on field(s).  The selected fields for sort order are shown after ORDER
BY clause of SQL statement in which ascending order is the choice
by default.
(viii) Click at row to check for the selected field to be displayed in the
query result. The field(s) may be selected only for the purpose of
specifying the sort order or criteria.
Click at row of the grid to specify the criteria to limit the records
to be displayed by the query being created. The specified criteria
result in a conditional expression, which is shown after the
WHERE clause of SQL statement.
Click File % Save (or Press Ctrl+S) to save a query. A dialog box
prompts the user to specify the name of the query being created.
By default a generic name appears which can be accepted or
rewritten with a desired name.
(c) SQL View Method : A query may be directly specified in Select Query Pane
by a right click at table pane % SQL view.  The upper and lower panes of
selected query window are substituted by a pane to specify the SQL statement
that is written by using keyboard. The desired SQL statement is directly
okeyed in on this pane and saved in the same manner as described for
design method. While forming the SQL statement, the following clauses are
normally used for generating information (or Select) queries :
(i) SELECT : This clause is used to specify the fields to display data or
information. Consider the following SQL statement segment :
SELECT Code, Name, Amount
The fields Code, Name and Amount after SELECT clause indicate
the data items to be displayed by the query statement.
(ii) FROM : This clause is meant to indicate the source of data in terms
of tables or queries or a combination of both. Two tables are joined
by specifying a JOIN clause based on a condition of Join. There can
be three types of Join: Inner, Left and right.
(iii) INNER : This Join clause is meant to display only exactly matching
records between two data sources. Consider the following SQL
statement segment:
FROM Accounts INNER JOIN AccountType
ON ( CatId=Type)
In the above statement, only those records of Accounts and
AccountType table constitute the source of query data, which match
exactly on CatId = Type.
Accountancy
(iv) LEFT : With this Join, all the records in the primary table in the
relationship are displayed irrespective whether there are matching
records in the related table or not. Consider the following SQL
statement segment :
FROM Accounts LEFT JOIN AccountType
ON ( CatId=Type)
In the above statement, all records of Accounts  along with matching
records of  AccountType table constitute the source of query data,
The matching condition is CatId = Type.
(v) RIGHT : With this Join, all the records of related table in the
relationship are displayed irrespective whether there are matching
records in the primary table or not. Consider the following SQL
statement segment
FROM Accounts RIGHT JOIN AccountType
ON ( CatId=Type)
In the above statement, all records of AccountType along with
matching records of Accounts table constitute the source of query
data. The matching condition is CatId=Type.
(iv) WHERE : This clause in SQL statement is used to provide the
condition to restrict the records to be returned by query. The
resultant records of query must satisfy the condition which is
specified after WHERE clause. This is meant to filter records returned
by the query.
(v) ORDER BY : This clause is meant to specify the order in which the
resultant records of query are required to appear. The basis of
ordering is determined by the list of fields specified after the order
by clause. Consider the following SQL statement segment :
ORDER BY Type, Code
The above statement in the context of Accounts table implies that
the resultant record set is ordered by the Type field of Accounts
and within Type, by Code field of Accounts.
(vi) GROUP BY : The group by clause is used in the SQL statement to
enable grouping of records for creating summary query. The fields
after GROUP BY clause constitute the basis of grouping for which
summary results are obtained. Consider the following SQL statement:
SELECT Debit, Sum(Amount)
FROM Vouchers
GROUP BY Debit
Accounting System using DBMS
In the above SQL statement, the GROUP BY clause uses Debit
account codes as the basis for computing the sum of amount of
voucher. The total amount, by which every transacted account has
been debited, is given by this SQL statement In this case, sum of
amount is found for each group of records formed using GROUP BY
clause.
15.5 Generating Accounting Reports
An Accounting system without reporting capability is incomplete as reporting
is one of the main purposes for which an accounting system is designed and
operated upon. The output of accounting system takes the form of accounting
reports. Access offers a great flexibility in designing and generating customised
reports.
15.5.1 Accounting Reports
Every report consists of ‘information’, which is different from ‘data’. Data
processing leads to data transformation and when this processing is in
accordance with decision usefulness, it is called information. Information
generation is the process of compiling, arranging, formatting and presenting
information to the users. A report is prepared with a definite objective. Every
report is collection of related information for a particular need and purpose
and must meet the twin objectives of reporting : one to reduce the level of
uncertainty that is faced by a decision-maker; second to influence the behaviour
(or positive actions) of the decision-maker. Accordingly, accounting information,
generated by processing accounting data is gathered to generate an accounting
report. An accounting report, therefore, is the physical form of accounting
information. Useful accounting information, regardless of its physical form,
must have five characteristics: relevance, timeliness, accuracy, completeness
and summarisation. An accounting report, in order to be useful, must display
information content in such a manner as to give confidence to the user,
influence his behaviour and prompt him to take positive actions.  Reports,
which do not meet the above stated objectives, lack or do not have sufficient
information content, have no value. There are two broad classes of accounting
reports: Programmed and Casual (also called Adhoc or Pass through).
(a) Programmed Reports : These reports contain information useful for decision-
making situations that the users have anticipated to occur. There are two
types of reports within this report type: Scheduled and On demand.
• Scheduled Reports : The reports, which are produced according to a
given time frame, are called scheduled reports. The time frame may be
daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly. Some examples of scheduled
Accountancy
reports are: Trial Balance, Ledger, Statement of Cash Transactions
(Cash Book), Statement of Ageing Accounts, Closing Stock Report, Profit
and Loss Account and Balance Sheet, etc.
On Demand Reports : The reports, which are generated only on the
triggering of some event, are called On demand reports. Some examples
of On demand reports are a Customer’s Statement of Account, Inventory
Re-order Report, Stock in hand Report for a Selected Group of
items, etc.
Casual Reports : There are reports, the need for which is not anticipated,
the information content of which may be useful but casually required.
These are adhoc reports and are generated casually by executing some
simple queries without requiring much of professional assistance. As
opposed to programmed reports, casual reports are generated as and
when required.
15.5.2 Process of Creating Reports
The process of generating accounting reports in Access involves three steps:
designing the report, identifying the accounting information queries, and finally
creating an accounting report by using such queries.
(i) Designing the Report : Every report is expected to meet certain objectives
of reporting for which it is designed and developed. It should not be too
big so as not to be read at all or too small so as to conceal certain vital
information of importance that is expected to facilitate decision-making.
Objective-oriented reporting means designing the report in such a manner
as to meet the pre-conceived objectives in view.
(ii) Identifying Accounting Information Queries : A number of SQL statements
are written in such a manner that each successive SQL relies on the
results of the preceding SQL statement and refines its results by using
fresh data (or information) from existing data tables (or queries).
(iii) Using the Record set of Final SQL : The record set of final SQL that relies upon
preceding SQL statement, is collection of report-oriented information. This
record set need be embedded in the report being produced.
15.5.3 Basics of Designing a Report in Access
A report, in Access, is a static presentation of stored or transformed data in
an organised manner. Access saves the design of the report, which consists of
information structure along with various controls to display information
content and its record source. When a saved report is opened, the information
content is retrieved from the tables and displayed according to the design. As
a result, a saved report design, when opened, displays the information content
Accounting System using DBMS
according to the current state of data. There are two types of formats of
presenting information through a report: Columnar and Tabular.
Columnar Report Format : A columnar format displays the caption of each
field on a separate line in a single column down the page. The corresponding
information contents of the fields are shown in another column next to
their respective fields. If the caption property of a field is kept blank, the
name of the field is used as its caption. This implies that there are two
columns in this format: one for displaying the fields and another for showing
the corresponding information content. A record set that consists of nine
fields, when presented in such a format, requires nine lines of report. In
columnar format, the total number of lines to be printed equals the number
of fields multiplied by the number of record sets to be displayed.
Tabular Report Format : A tabular format displays the caption of fields on
the same line so that their respective information contents appear in the
next line. The number of columns in tabular report is exactly equal to the
number of fields to be displayed. It implies that the above mentioned record
set, when presented in tabular format, requires one line for captions of
fields and another line for information content. In tabular format, the
total number of lines to be printed equals the number of record sets to be
displayed plus one for captions of fields to constitute column headings.
15.5.4 Structure of Report in Access
A report in Access is designed using seven sections which taken together
constitutes the structure of report design. It is not necessary that every report
designed in Access must have all the sections that have been described below:
Report Header : Report header appears at the top of the report and may
include title and other relevant information pertaining to the report.
Page Header : Page header appears at the top of every page of the report.
It may include a uniform title to indicate that the page belongs to a
particular report.
Group Header : The group header and footer are available in a report only
if the sort order and grouping levels are also defined on the basis of a field
of data source. This is because Group Header and Footers are properties
of the field that are used for defining the sort order. Depending on grouping
level, the group header appears at the top of each report group. A set of
report pages constitutes a report group. Each group level of report contains
a separate group header.
Details : The details section, which is also called the main body of a report,
contains data from tables or queries that provide the record source to a
report. This section is most important as it consists of the main information
content of a report.
Accountancy
Group Footer : The group footer appears at the bottom of each grouping
level and may contain summaries or sub-totals for the grouped data.
Page Footer : The page footer appears at the bottom of each page of the
report and is meant to include page numbers, date and time of report
generation.
Report Footer : The report footer appears once on the last page of the
report to include summaries or totals for all data of the  report.
It is not necessary to incorporate each and every section or component of
report structure. Those report structure components, which are not required
in a specific report being designed, are suppressed. To achieve this suppression,
open the View Menu to hide or display the Report Header/Footer, Report
Page Header/Footer. The size of every section or report structure component
is increased or decreased by dragging section bars up or down using a mouse.
15.5.5 Methods of Creating a Report
There are three ways in which a report can be created in Access. A brief
description of each method is given below:
(a) Auto Report: This is the easiest method of creating a report both with
columnar and tabular formats. To begin with formulate, create and save a
query, which is capable of providing a record set as the information source
of report. Alternatively, the information content must be available in a
single table of the database. If the information is generated by relying
upon more than one table, query is the option to be exercise. After the
information source becomes available in the database, the following
procedure is adopted to create Auto Reports.
Select Reports from objects list given in LHS of Database window
and click at New object button of tool bar. Access responds by
displaying the following New Report Window.
Choose AutoReport: Columnar or AutoReport: Tabular, followed
by selecting the information source query or table.
(iii) Click OK to generate the report. Access responds by creating and
displaying the report in printpreview mode.
(iv) To print the report, click at the print icon on tool bar.
To save the report design as object, close the print preview window,
and provide a suitable name.
Auto Reports are easy and fast to create. But these reports are less
attractive. To prepare more professional report, report wizard is used.
Accounting System using DBMS
Fig. 15.8 : New report window to choose methods of report design
(b) Wizard : The Report wizard allows a designer to choose the fields from
multiple tables along with specification for grouping, sorting and formatting
of information content in report. This obviates the limitation of Auto
Reports. In order to create reports by wizard, following steps are required.
(i) After selecting Reports object, double click at Create Report by
Using Wizard. Access responds by displaying Report Wizard window
similar to the one displayed for query wizard (See Fig 14.10).
(ii) Choose the table or query that includes information content of report,
from Tables/Queries drop-down list on LHS.
(iii) Use arrow buttons to select fields to provide the information source
to report. Single right arrow button is used to select one field and
double arrow button to select all fields. Alternatively, double click
at the fields to be selected in the same order in which they are required
to be displayed in the report.
(iv) Another table or query can be chosen to select more fields for a
report to provide a definite relationship between the tables is defined.
Click Next when selection process of data source is complete.
Accountancy
(v) Access responds by prompting the designer to add any grouping
level(s) for displaying the information content of the report. The report
is prepared by choosing any repeated data item to constitute a group.
Click Next when the grouping level is added and defined.
(vi) Access responds by requiring the designer to specify the sort order
based on any of the fields contained in the report. The records may
be sorted up to four fields by specifying either ascending or
descending order for each field. After specifying the sort order, click
Next or specify the summary values to calculate. The summary
values are sum, average, minimum and maximum. Once summary
values are specified, click OK, followed by click Next.
(vii) Report wizard responds by requiring the designer to choose the report
layout (stepped, block, outline and align left) and its orientation
(portrait and landscape). Click Next after specifying the layout and
orientation.
(viii) Report wizard prompts the designer to choose a particular style of
report from among six styles: bold, casual, compact, corporate,
formal and soft-gray. After choosing a suitable style for report, click
Next.
(ix) Report wizard prompts the designer to specify the title of report
being designed. Further, the designer is provided with two options:
preview the report or modify its design. After exercising the option,
click Finish.
(x) Access presents the report in preview mode or design mode depending
on which option is chosen in (i) above.
(c) Design View : The design view method offers greatest flexibility to the
designer in designing a report. In this method, the report is designed by
assembling and embedding various components from report tool box. In
order to design a report by using design view, following steps are required:
(i) After selecting Reports object, double click Create report in Design
view. Access responds by providing a blank report object with three
sections: Report/Page header, Detail and Report/Page footer as
shown in Figure : 15.9.
(ii) Right click the mouse at the black spot appearing at the left of
horizontal ruler of above report. Report object responds by displaying
a drop down window.
(iii) Click Properties and select Record Source from Data tab. The record
source turns into a combo control giving a list of various tables and
queries. Choose the appropriate source of information to be presented
Accounting System using DBMS
in the report being designed. Access responds by providing a list of
fields of the selected record source. If this list does not appear or it
is closed by mistake, it can be recalled by clicking at the field list
icon appearing before the icon for  tool box.
Fig.15.9 : Window displaying design view of report
(iv) Select the required fields from list of fields displayed as discussed in
(c) above, by clicking at each of the fields to be selected while keeping
the Ctrl key pressed. Drag and drop the selected fields to Detail
section.
(v) The label part of each field is moved to Report/Page header and text
part is accordingly aligned below their respective labels column wise.
The caption of each label giving headings can be suitably modified,
if required.
(vii) The vertical ruler controlling the distance between various report
sections can be suitably adjusted to give a better look to the report.
Accountancy
The Report/Page footer bar is brought close to the fields laid out in
Detail section so that the gap between records of details section is
minimized.
(viii) Page headers and page footers may also be added by right click at
title bar of report object, followed by click at Page header/footer.
15.5.6 Refining the Report Design
The design of the report created by any of the methods described above may
be improved upon by making the following additions and modifications to the
report. For this purpose, an existing report is opened in design mode.
Adding Dates and Page Numbers : When an existing report is opened in
design mode, the page footer of the report contains two unbound controls:
the current date and current page number of total number of pages.
Both the controls may be customised according to the requirement of the
designer. The date control uses = Now() function to retrieve the current
date from RTC of computer. The format of date may be modified by selecting
General date, Medium date, Short date or Long date from format property
of this control.
Further, when a report is created using design view method, the date and/
or time and also the page numbers may be added to any of its part. The
date and time is added by clicking Insert % date and time from the menu
bar to open the Date and Time dialog box. After selecting and specifying
the desired preferences regarding date and time, click OK to find that a
text control with chosen date and time preferences is added at the top of
active report section. This added text control containing date and time
may be dragged and dropped in any part of the report as per requirement.
Similarly, the page number is added by clicking Insert % page numbers
from the menu bar to open the Page numbers dialogue box. This dialogue
allows the designer to specify the format, position and alignment. The two
formats are: Page N (for example Page 1) and Page N of M ( for example
Page 1 of 10). The position to specify is either Top of Page (header) or
Bottom of Page (footer). Possible alignment, which may be specified are
Centre, left, right, inside and outside.
Adding and Deleting Report Controls : After a report has been designed,
additional report controls may be added or deleted by the same procedure
as applicable to forms. Clicking tool bar icon opens report design tool bar,
which contains a set of useful controls.
(a) After opening the report in design mode, click Field List button on
report design tool bar. This results in opening the field list window.
Accounting System using DBMS
(b) Drag the field into an appropriate section of the report. The field appears
with both label and text box control. The label part gives a constant
field heading while the text part provid
.es different values of the field. These two parts are accordingly placed at the
appropriate sections of the report.
(c) A field control may be deleted by selecting the control and pressing the
Delete key.
Conditionally Formatting Report Controls : The conditional formatting of
text boxes and combo boxes in reports can be achieved in the same manner,
as it applies to Forms. The conditional formatting allows the designer to
apply special text formats that depend on the value of field. This facility is
a useful tool to draw the attention of user or reader of report to some
values of particular interest, such as amounts exceeding certain limit or
unexpected balances in some accounts. In order to create a conditional
formatting, following steps are required:
(a) Open the report in design view.
(b) Select a control and click at format on menu bar, followed by conditional
formatting.
(c) Provide the necessary conditions for formatting to occur in the same
manner as already discussed while applying conditional formatting to
design of Forms.
(d) The conditional formatting is removed by re-opening the same dialog
and clicking at delete button.
Grouping Levels and Sorting Order : The purpose of grouping is to organise
the information content of a report into categories.  Sorting order is meant
to arrange such information content into numerical or alphabetical order.
With groupings the sorting applies to each individual group. The grouping
and sorting of information, when applied together, make the report more
meaningful and therefore useful to the user of the report. In order to specify
the grouping and sorting order, following procedure is adopted.
Click at Sorting and Grouping icon of Report Design Tool bar (This
icon is located next to icon for tool box). Immediately, Access
responds by displaying the following Sorting and Grouping dialogue
The LHS of this dialog box provides a list of fields or expressions
that are to be used for grouping and sorting. In the above dialog
box, Type field of Accounts has been chosen as the basis of grouping
the information content of trial balance. The group header and footer
property is set to Yes to indicate that there is separate header and
footer for each group of accounts in trial balance.
Accountancy

15.5.7 Saving and Exporting a Report
After a report is designed, it may be generated to preview its final shape. Both
the design and a generated report are saved for future use and reference. The
generated report may also be exported for use by others, as described below:
(a) Saving and Exporting Report Object in Access : The design of a report is
saved in Access as report object by assigning a particular name. The report
object, when opened in access by click action generates the desired report
as per design specification. The design may also be exported to another
database file of Access. This is achieved by clicking File % Export and
then selecting and existing database into which the report design is to be
exported. Access responds by providing a dialog box to give the name by
which the exported report is saved in a selected database.
Accounting System using DBMS
(b) Saving as Snapshot : After a report is created, it may be saved in such a
manner so as to be viewed by others without the help of Access. This
becomes possible by saving the report as a snapshot file. As a result, a
high quality picture image of each page of report is created with Adobe
Acrobat software. Other users of the report can then view the report and
print any of its pages without being able to modify its contents. It must be
ensured that this feature of saving a report as snapshot is also installed
while installing the MS Office 2000 package. In order to create a report
Snapshot, following steps are required :
Select and generate a report in Database Window.
Click File % Export from menu bar. An Export Report dialog box
appears.
Choose the folder from combo box next to Save in; provide a file name;
select snapshot from list control next to Save as type and click at
Save button. While saving the report ensure that the auto start check
box is enabled.
The generated report is saved as a snapshot and can be supplied to
others for printing and viewing without the help of the Access database
environment.
(c) Exporting to Excel : A generated report may be exported to Excel, which is
a spreadsheet package. This software package is a part of MS Office product
and is generally installed while installing MS Access. A report is exported
to Excel by following the same steps as have been listed above while saving
a report as snapshot, except that before clicking save button in (c) above,
one has to select Microsoft Excel 2000/2002 from list control next to Save
as type.
(d) Exporting to MS Word : A report generated using Access can also be exported
to MS word, which is a text processing package. This package is also
installed while installing MS Access, as a part of MS Office. In order to
export a report to MS Word, the following steps are required :
Select and generate a report in Database Window.
If print preview tool bar is absent in Access window, Click View %
Tool bars % Print preview from menu bar of Access. Access
responds by providing print preview tool bar for reports.
(iii)
Click at right corner of icon for Official Links. There are three options
in the list: Merge It with MS Word, Publish It with MS Word and
Analyse It with MS Excel.
Click Publish it with MS Word, which is also the default option.
The generated report is exported to MS Word package and can be
dealt with like any other document created using MS Word.
Accountancy
(e) Printing a Report : A generated report may also be printed by taking the
following steps provided a printer attached to the computer is installed.
Choose File from menu bar % Print
Access responds by providing a print window, which allows the
user to select a printer, the number of copies to be printed and also
the range of pages to be printed.
(iii)
Properties button is clicked to define print quality under set-up tab
and orientation under paper tab. Two-sided printing may also be
obtained if the printer supports this feature.
(f) E-Mailing a Report : A report generated by Access may also be sent using

15.5.8 Designing Accounting Reports using Access
Financial Accounting Reports such as Cash book, Bank book, Ledger Accounts
and Trial Balance may be generated in Access by adhering to report generation
process. The exact process in the context of each of these reports is described
below :
Trial Balance
The Trial Balance is one of the accounting reports, which provides the net
amount by which each account, during a given period of time, has been debited
or credited. The format of a typical trial balance is as given below :
Trial Balance
Account Title
Debit
Credit
Amout
Amount
Total
Fig. 15.11 :  Format of trial balance
To produce a trial balance, it is necessary to retrieve a set of processed
data records each of which provides information on Code (or Account Number),
Name of Account (or Particulars), Debit balance and Credit balance with
reference to a each account. In order to find net balance corresponding to
every account along with its identity, following steps are taken :
(i) To find the total amount by which every account has been debited;
(ii) To find the total amount by which every account has been Credited;
(iii) To find a collective record set of accounts with their debit and credit
totals;
(iv) To find the net amount with which every account has been debited or
credited; and
(vi) To find the record set which consists of Account code, name of Account,
Debit and Credit Amount.
Above steps to produce trial balance are transformed into a series of SQL
statements, which vary according to the database design. The details of the
above procedure along with the relevant SQL statements need be explained in
the context of the three Models as given below :
Model-I : The following series of SQL statements retrieve a record set for
producing trial balance when database design for Model-I is used.
Accountancy
(a) To find the total amount by which the accounts have been debited : In order
to ascertain the total amount by which every transacted account has been
debited, the SELECT clause need to have two fields: one code to identify
the transacted account and another to generate the total by which such
account has been debited. This is achieved by using Debit field of Vouchers
table and finding the sum of amount corresponding to each of the
transacted accounts. The FROM clause relies upon Vouchers table to get
the data source. The GROUP BY clause specifies the field on the basis of
which grouping of record set is formed. This grouping is necessary in SQL
when aggregate query is used to generate summary information. The
summing of amount is obtained by using aggregate function, Sum( ). This
function, as already explained, uses a field with data type Number, as an
input argument and returns its sum as output. Accordingly, the following
SQL statement is formed :
SELECT Debit AS Code, Sum(amount) AS Total
FROM vouchers
GROUP BY debit;
In the above SQL statement, the GROUP BY clause retrieves the rows of
vouchers table accounts-wise because the debit field refers to account code.
As a result, the Sum( ) computes the sum of amount of a particular debit
account and reports against Debit account of SELECT clause. This SQL
statement is saved as Query 01for its subsequent use. The total of debit amount
in this query is given by Total field with positive amounts.
(b) To find the total amount by which the accounts have been credited : In order
to ascertain the total amount by which every transacted account has been
credited, a query similar to that in (a) need be formed, except that the
Debit field in SELECT and GROUP BY clause is substituted by Credit
field.  The sum of amount generated by sum(Amount) is multiplied by -1
so that the final amount assigned to Total field is always negative. This is
because the amount of credit must be a negative amount if amount of
debit is taken as positive. The purpose of using negative values is to
differentiate between debit and credit totals for each account and also to
facilitate the simple arithmetic summation for obtaining the net amount.
Accordingly, the following SQL statement is formed :
SELECT Credit AS Code, Sum(Amount)*(-1) AS Total
FROM vouchers
GROUP BY Credit;
This SQL statement is saved as Query 02 to be used as source by next
query.
Accounting System using DBMS
(c) To generate a collective record set of accounts with their debit and credit
totals : Every transacted account that has been debited (or credited) only
appears once in this collective record set. However, those transacted
accounts that have been debited as well as credited appear twice in this
record set: once with a positive amount and thereafter with a negative
amount. This collective record set is generated by executing a UNION query
between Query 01 and Query 02.
SELECT*
FROM Query 01
UNION SELECT*
FROM Query 02 ;
This SQL statement is saved as Query 03 for further processing of its
resultant record set.
(d) To generate the net amount with which an account has been debited or
credited : Once the records of account codes with debit and/or  credit
totals have been collected, the next logical step is to find out the net amount
by which such accounts have been either debited or credited. This is
accomplished by forming another aggregate query in which FROM clause
uses Query 03 as the data source.  The sum of Total for each Code of data
source, provided by Query 03, results in computing net amount for every
account. Accordingly, the following SQL statement is formed to generate a
list of account codes with their respective balances: positive or negative.
SELECT Code, Sum(Total) AS Net
FROM Query 03
GROUP BY Code;
A positive net amount implies a debit and negative amount means a credit
balance corresponding to an account code. This is because in Query 02, the
total of credit amount has been made to appear as negative. This query is
saved as Query 04 for its subsequent use in generating record set for trial
balance.
(e) To find that record set which consists of account code, name of account,
debit amount and credit amount : Every row of a trial balance report consists
of Account Code, Name of Account, Debit Amount and Credit Amount.
The Debit Amount and Credit Amount are mutually exclusive. Such rows
are obtained by generating a record set based on the following SQL
statement.
SELECT a.Code, b.name AS [Name of Account], IIF
(a.Net>0,a.Net,null) AS Debit,
IIF (a.Net<0,abs(a.Net) ,null) AS Credit
FROM Query 04 AS a, Accounts AS b
WHERE a.code = b.code ;
Accountancy
In the above SQL statement, the results of Query 04 and data stored in
Accounts table has been used. The SELECT clause of this SQL statement has
two computed fields as explained below :
IIF(a.Net>0,a.Net,null) AS Debit:  According to IIF( ) function, if the net
amount exceeds zero, it is displayed as Debit, otherwise nothing appears
in Debit field.
IIF(a.Net<0,abs(a.Net) ,null) AS Credit: According to IIF( ) function, if the
net amount is less than zero (implying negative), it is displayed as Credit,
otherwise nothing appears in Credit field.
Besides, the other two fields: Code and Name, of SELECT clause are
retrieved from Query 04 and Accounts table respectively. This SQL statement
is saved as Query 05 for providing the necessary information content for Trial
Balance Report.
Model-II : The following series of SQL statements retrieve the record set for
producing trial balance when database design for Model-II is used. In addition
to this, the accounts have been categorised within the trial balance according
to the Account Type: Expenses, Revenues, Assets and Liabilities.
(a) To find the total amount by which the accounts have been debited : The
transacted accounts in design of Model-II have been stored in AccCode of
VouchersMain and Code of VouchersDetail.  The following SQL statement
is formed to generate the relevant information from VouchersDetails.
SELECT Code, Sum(amount) AS Total
FROM vouchersMain INNER JOIN vouchersDetails ON
VouchersMain.Vno = VouchersDetails.Vno
WHERE Type = 0
GROUP BY Code ;
Similarly, the following SQL statement is formed to generate the required
information from VouchersMain table.
SELECT AccCode As Code, sum(amount) AS Total
FROM vouchersMain INNER JOIN vouchersDetails ON
VouchersMain.Vno = VouchersDetails.Vno
WHERE Type = 1
GROUP BY AccCode ;
Both the SQL statements are meant to extract similar sets of records, but
from two different sources. Therefore, the resultant record set of these SQL
statements have been horizontally merged using UNION clause as shown below:
SELECT Code, sum(amount) AS Total
FROM vouchersMain INNER JOIN vouchersDetails ON
VouchersMain.Vno = VouchersDetails.Vno
WHERE Type = 0
GROUP BY Code
Accounting System using DBMS
UNION ALL
SELECT AccCode As Code, sum(amount) AS Total
FROM vouchersMain INNER JOIN vouchersDetails ON
VouchersMain.Vno = VouchersDetails.Vno
WHERE Type = 1
GROUP BY AcCode ;
The above SQL statement is saved as Query101for its subsequent use.
The total of debit amount in this query represents the Total with positive
amounts.
(b) To find the total amount by which the accounts have been credited :  In
order to ascertain the total amount by which every transacted account
has been credited, a query similar to that in (a) need be formed. This is
achieved by substituting Debit field in SELECT and GROUP BY clause by
Credit field and the sum of amount generated by sum(Amount) is multiplied
by-1 so that the final amount assigned to Total field is always negative.
Accordingly, the following SQL statement is formed :
SELECT Code, sum(amount)*-1 AS Total
FROM vouchersMain INNER JOIN vouchersDetails ON
VouchersMain.Vno=VouchersDetails.Vno
WHERE Type=1 GROUP BY Code, Amount
UNION
SELECT AccCode As Code, sum(amount)*-1 AS Total
FROM vouchersMain INNER JOIN vouchersDetails ON
VouchersMain.Vno=VouchersDetails.Vno
WHERE Type=0 GROUP BY AccCode, Amount;
In the above SQL statement, the sum of amount has been multiplied by -1 to
ensure that the amount of credit is always negative just as amount of debit is
taken as positive. This query is saved as Query102 for its subsequent use.
(c) To find a collective record set of accounts with their debit and credit totals:
A collective record set is generated by forming a union query between
Query101 and Query102 to ensure that the debit and credit amount with
respect to each account becomes available for generating the net amount.
Accordingly, the following SQL statement is formed.
SELECT*
FROM Query101
UNION Select*
FROM Query102;
Accountancy
The above SQL statement causes horizontal merger of record sets returned
by Query101 and Query102. This SQL Statement is saved as Query103 for its
subsequent use in next query.
(d) To find the net amount with which an account has been debited or credited:
To generate the net amount, an SQL statement similar to Query04 (designed
for query (d) of Model-I) above, is formed as shown below, except that its
source of data is Query103 instead of Query 03.
SELECT Code, Sum(Total) AS Net
FROM Query103
GROUP BY Code;
This query is saved as Query104 for its subsequent use in generating a
record set, giving details of information for trial balance.
(e) To find the record set which consists of Account code, Name of Account,
Debit  Amount and Credit Amount :  This query, which is meant to provide
relevant information to the trial balance report, is similar to Query 05
(designed and discussed in (e) of Model-I). Accordingly, the following SQL
statement is formed by changing the source of data from Query 05 to
Query105 as shown below :
SELECT a.Code, b.name AS [Name of Account], IIF(a.Net>0,a.Net,null) AS
Debit, IIF(a.Net<0,abs(a.Net) ,null) AS Credit FROM Query104 AS a,
Accounts AS b/
WHERE a.code = b.code;
In above SQL statement, the results of Query104 and data stored in
accounts table has been used. This SQL statement is saved as Query105 for
providing source of information to Trial Balance Report.
Trial Balance with Sorting and Grouping levels : In order to prepare a trial
balance with all the account duly grouped by and sorted within category of
accounts, two additional queries (f) and (g) are required.
(f) To find the record set of accounts with their category and category ID :
Accounts table is related to AccountType table vide Type field. The following
SQL statement, using INNER JOIN clause, is formed to retrieve the relevant
fields for various accounts.
SELECT Accounts.Code, Accounts.Name, Category, CatId FROM Accounts
INNER JOIN AccountType ON
Accounts.Type = Account type.CatId;
This SQL statement is saved as Query 106 for its subsequent use in next
query.
(g) To find the record set consisting of Account Code, Name of Account, Debit
Amount and Credit Amount along with category details :  This query, when
compared with (e) above, reveals that two additional fields: Category and
Accounting System using DBMS
CatId are required. Accordingly, the SQL statement stored as Query105
is modified by substituting Accounts table with Query106 to form the
following Statement.
SELECT a.Code, b.name AS [Name of Account],
IIF(a.Net>0,a.Net,null) AS Debit, IIF(a.Net<0,abs(a.Net) ,null) AS Credit,
Category, CatId
FROM Query104 AS a, Query106 AS b
WHERE a.code = b.code ;
This SQL statement is saved as Query107 to provide information details
for designing trial balance with grouping and sorting of the accounts.

Summary with Reference to Learning Objectives
Accounting Reports : A report displays information that is acquired from data
processing and transformation in an organised manner. Reports tend to reduce
the level of uncertainty associated with decision-makers and also influence their
positive actions. The output of the computerised accounting system are
accounting reports. Financial accounting reports such as Cash book, Bank
book, Ledger, and Trial Balance may be generated in Access by adhering to
report generation process.
Using Access for Producing Reports : In Access, the reports are created by
designing a report, identifying its information requirement, creating the queries
in SQL to generate such information so that the final SQL statement provides
the record set of information to the report design. Different Models of database
design require different sets of SQL statements to produce different types of
reports.
Queries Access : There are several types of queries in Access that may be used
to generate information. Such queries are called select queries because they are
used to select records from the given set of records. There are three ways in
which these queries may be created in Access: Wizard, Design View and SQL
View method.
Designing Reports in Access : A report in Access may be designed in three ways:
Auto Report, Wizard and Design View method. A SQL statement (or query) is
capable of displaying records containing fields from across a number of data
tables. A typical report in Access has the structure that consists of Report header,
Page header, Group header, Details, Group footer, Page footer and Report footer.

APPENDIX
Description of Commonly Used Functions in Access
There are three types of functions that are used to set the Control Source property
of calculated controls and/or to form part of calculated field expression in SQL
statement. A brief description of the commonly used functions is below :
A-1. Domain Aggregate Functions
These functions are used to perform calculations based on values in a field of a
table or query. Criteria to select the set of records in the table or query that is
desired to be used for calculations may also be specified. The criteria, if not
specified, imply that all the records of the table or query specific to the field are
used for computation. All the domain aggregate functions use the same syntax
as is given hereunder :
DFunction (“FldName”, “TblName” or QryName”, “SrchCond”)
Wherein DFunction refers to a named domain aggregate function. A brief
description of its input arguments is given below:
FldName : It refers to the name of field that is to be searched in a table or
query, which is specified as an argument.
TblName (or QueryName) : It refers to the name of a table or query that contains
the field specified as second input argument.
SrchCond : It refers to the search condition on the basis of which the relevant
record is searched.
Some of the important domain aggregate functions have been described as
below :
(a) DLookup : This function is meant to look up information that is stored in
a table or query, which is not the underlying source of Access Form or
Report. It is used to set the Control Source property of a calculated control
to display data from other table or query. Consider the following example:
DLookup (“Name”, “Accounts”, “Code = ‘110001’”)
In the above example, this function has been applied to search the name of
account (in Accounts table) whose code is ‘110001’.
(b) DMax and DMin : These functions are used to retrieve respectively the
maximum and minimum values in the specified field. Consider the
following example :
DMin (“Amount”, “Vouchers”, “Debit = ‘711001’”)
Dmax (“Amount”, “Vouchers”, “Debit = ‘711001’")
In the above examples, the amount of minimum purchase transaction
and maximum purchase transaction is retrieved and reported. It may also
be noted that ‘711001’ is the code of Purchase account in Accounts table
(c) DSum : This function computes and returns the sum of the values in the
specified field or expression. For Example, in a table : Sales that contains
Accountancy
ItemCode, Price and Quantity as fields, the total amount of sales may be
computed by using the DSum () function as follows :
DSum (“Price*Quantity”, “Sales”)
However, if the total sales is to computed for a particular item coded as
1678, the DSum () function shall be applied as follows :
DSum (“Price*Quantity”, “Sales”, “ItemCode = 1678”)
(d) DFirst and DLast : These functions are used to retrieve respectively the
values in the specified field from first and last physical records.
Consider the following application examples :
DFirst (“Name”, “Accounts”)
DLast (“Name”, “Accounts”)
In the above examples, the name first and last account that physically
exists in Accounts table is retrieved and reported.
(e) DCount : This function is meant to compute the number of records with
non-null values in the specified field. Consider the following application
example :
DCount (“*”, “Accounts”)
In the above example, The number of records in accounts table are counted
and reported by DCount () function.
A-2. SQL Aggregate Functions
The SQL aggregate functions have the functionality similar to that of domain
aggregate function. However, unlike domain aggregate functions, these functions
cannot be called directly into controls used in Forms and Reports of Access.
These functions are used in SQL statements that provide the underlying record
source of Forms and Reports. All these functions, when used require the GROUP
BY clause in SQL statement :
(a) Sum : This function is used to compute and return the sum of a set of values.
For Example, consider the following SQL statement that has been used in
Chapter-V to prepare the underlying information source of Trial Balance
(Model-I.).
SELECT Debit As Code, Sum (Amount) As Total
FROM VOUCHERS
GROUP By Debit ;
In the above SQL statement, Sum () has been used to compute the total amount
by which the transacted accounts have beeen debited.
(b) Min and Max : These functions are used to retrieve respectively the minimum
and maximum of value set with respect to field or query expression. For
Example, the following SQL statement is capable of returning the amount of
minimum and maximum sales transaction in Model-I :
SELECT Min (Amount) As MinSales, Max (Amount) As MaxSales
FROM Vouchers
WHERE Credit = ‘811001’ ;
Accounting System using DBMS
It may be noted that the sales account that is coded as ‘811001’ is credited as
and when a sales transaction is recorded.
(c) Count : This function counts the number of records returned by a query. The
number of times a sales transaction has occurred and recorded in books of
accounts can be known by executing the following SQL statement.
SQL statement.
SELECT count (*)
FROM Vouchers
WHERE Credit = ‘811001’
In the above SQL statement, the Credit field stores the account code of sales
when a sales transaction occurs. The WHERE clause restricts the number of
records returned by the above SQL to those in which credit field has the
account code of sales. Accordingly, the count () function returns the count
value of records returned by the above SQL statement.
(d) First and Last : These functions are meant to retrieve the first and last record
of a value set pertaining to a field or query expression.
A-3. Other Functions
(a) IIF : The purpose of this function is to provide a value to the field from a
mutually exclusive set of values. Its syntax is as given below :
IIIF (<Condition>, Value-1, Value-2)
Wherein <Condition> refers to any logical expression in which a comparison
is made by using following comparison operators :
= equal to
<less than
>greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
The condition formed by the above comparison operators is evaluated to result
into TRUE or FALSE.
<Value-1> This value is returned by IIF() function to the field, if the condition
turns out to be TRUE
<Value-2> This value is returned by IIF() function to the field, if the condition
turns out to be FALSE
Example : Suppose a field Type is to return the string of characters “Debit”
when its value is 0 and “Credit” when its value is 1, IIF() function is used as
shown below :
IIF (Type = 0, “Debit”, “Credit”)
(b) Abs : The purpose of this function is to return absolute value, This function
receives a numeric value as its input argument and returns an absolute value.
Consider the following examples on use of Abs ( ) function :
When – 84 is given as input argument to Abs(– 84), it returns 84
When 84 is given as input argument to Abs(84), it returns 84
Accountancy
(c) Val : The purpose of this function is to return the numbers contained in a
string as a numeric value of appropriate type. Its Syntax is Val(string)
The string argument of the above Val( ) function is any valid string expression.
The Val( ) function stops reading the string at the first character that cannot
be recognised as number. For example, Val(“12431”) returns the value 12431
by converting the enclosed string of numerals into value. However, Val
(“12,431”) returns the numeric value 12 because comma after 12 in the
enclosed string of characters in Val ( ) function is not recognised as number.

ou have learnt that financial accounting is a
well-defined sequential activity which begins
with Journal (Journalising), Ledger (Posting), and
preparation of Trial Balance (Balancing and
Summarisation at the first stage).  In the present
chapter, we will take up the next step, namely,
preparation of financial statements, and discuss the
types of information requirements of various
stakeholders, the distinction between capital and
revenue items and its importance and the nature
of financial statements and the preparation thereof.
9.1 Stakeholders and Their
Information Requirements
Recall from chapter I (Financial Accounting Part I)
that the objective of business is to communicate
the meaningful information to various stakeholders
in the business so that they can make informed
decisions. A stakeholder is any person associated
with the business. The stakes of various
stakeholders can be monetary or non-monetary. The
stakes can be active or passive; or can be direct or
indirect. The owner and persons advancing loan to
the business would have monetary stake. The
government, consumer or a researcher will have
non-monetary stake in the business. The
stakeholders are also called users who are normally
classified as internal and external depending upon
whether they are inside the business or outside the
business. All users have different objectives for
Accountancy
joining business and consequently different types of information requirements
from it. In nutshell, the various users have diverse financial information
requirements from the business.
For example we have classified the following into the category of internal
and external users specifying their objectives and consequent information
requirements.

Fig. 9.1 : Analysis of various users of accounting information
Financial Statements - I
Box 1
Accounting Process (up to Trial balance) :
1. Identify the transactions, which that are recorded.
2. Record transactions in journal. Only those transactions are recorded which are
measured in money terms. The system followed for recording is called double entry
system whereby two aspects (debit and credit) of every transaction are recorded.
Repeated transactions of same nature are recorded in subsidiary books, also called
special journals. Instead of recording all transactions in journal, they are recorded in
subsidiary books and the  journal proper. For example, the business would record all
credit sales in sales book and all credit purchases in purchases book. The other
examples of subsidiary books are return inwards book, return outwards book. An
other important special book is cash book, in which all cash and bank transactions
are recorded. The entries, which are not recorded in any of these books, are recorded
in a residual journal called journal proper.
3. The entries appearing in the above books are posted in the respective accounts in the ledger.
4. The accounts are balanced and listed in a statement called trial balance. If the total
amounts of debit and credit balances agree, accounts are taken as free from
arithmetical errors.
5. The trial balance forms the basis for making the financial statements, i.e. trading
and profit and loss account and balance sheet.
9.2 Distinction between Capital and Revenue
A very important distinction in accounting is between capital and revenue
items. The distinction has important implications for making of the trading
and profit and loss account and balance sheet. The revenue items form part
of  the trading and profit and loss account, the capital items help in the
preparation of a balance sheet.
9.2.1 Expenditure
Whenever payment and/or incurrence of an outlay are made for a purpose
other than the settlement of an existing liability, it is called expenditure. The
expenditures are incurred with a viewpoint they would give benefits to the
business. The benefit of an expenditure may extend up to one accounting
year or more than one year. If the benefit of expenditure extends up to one
accounting period, it is termed as revenue expenditure. Normally, they are
incurred for the day-to-day conduct of the business. An example can be
payment of salaries, rent, etc. The salaries paid in the current period will not
benefit the business in the next accounting period, as the workers have put
in their efforts in the current accounting period. They will have to be paid the
salaries in the next accounting period as well if they are made to work. If the
benefit of expenditure extends to more than one accounting period, it is termed
Accountancy
as capital expenditure. An example can be payment to acquire furniture for
use in the business. Furniture acquired in the current accounting period will
give benefits for many accounting periods to come. The usual examples of
capital expenditure can be payment to acquire fixed assets and/or to make
additions/extensions in the fixed assets.
Following points of distinction between capital expenditure and revenue
expenditure are worth noting :
(a) Capital expenditure increases earning capacity of business whereas
revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity.
(b) Capital expenditure is incurred to acquire fixed assets for operation of
business whereas revenue expenditure is incurred on day-to-day conduct
of business.
(c) Revenue expenditure is generally recurring expenditure and capital
expenditure is non-recurring by nature.
(d) Capital expenditure benefits more than one accounting year whereas
revenue expenditure normally benefits one accounting year.
(e) Capital expenditure (subject to depreciation) is recorded in balance sheet
whereas revenue expenditure (subject to adjustment for outstanding
and prepaid amount) is transferred to trading and profit and loss account.
Sometimes, it becomes difficult to correctly demarcate the expenditures
into revenue and capital category. In normal usage, the advertising expenditure
is termed as revenue expenditure. However, a heavy expenditure on advertising
on launching a product is likely to give benefit for more than one accounting
period, as people are likely to remember the advertisement for a slightly longer
period. Such revenue expenditures, which are likely to give benefit for more
than one accounting period, are termed as deferred revenue expenditure.
It must be understood that expenditure is a wider term and includes
expenses as well as assets. There is a difference between expenditure and
expense. Expenditure is any outlay made/incurred by the business firm. The
part of the expenditure, which is perceived to have been used or consumed in
the current year, is termed as expense of the current year.
Revenue expenditure is treated as expenses of the current year and is
shown in trading and profit and loss account. Hence, salary paid by the
business firm is treated as an expense of the current year. Capital expenditures
are also ultimately charged to income statement and are spread over to more
than one accounting period. Hence, furniture of Rs. 50,000 if expected to be
used for 5 years will be treated as expense @ Rs. 10,000 per year. The name
given for the expense is depreciation. The treatment of deferred revenue
expenditure is same as of capital expenditure. They are also written-off over
their expected period of benefit.
Financial Statements - I
9.2.2 Receipts
The similar treatment is given the receipts of the business. If the receipts
imply an obligation to return the money, these are capital receipts. The example
can be an additional capital brought in by the owner or a loan taken from the
bank. Both receipts are leading to obligations, the first to the owner (called
equity) and the other to the outsiders (called liabilities). Another example on a
capital receipt can be the sale of a fixed asset like old machinery or furniture.
However, if a receipt does not incur an obligation to return the money or is
not in the form of a sale of fixed asset, it is termed as revenue receipt. The
examples of such receipts sales made by the firm and interest on investment
received by the firm.
9.2.3 Importance of Distinction between Capital and Revenue
As stated earlier, the distinction between capital and revenue items has
important implications for the preparation of trading and profit and loss
account and the balance sheet as all items of revenue value are to the shown
in the trading and profit and loss account and the items of capital nature in
the balance sheet. If any item is wrongly classified, i.e. if any item of revenue
nature is treated as capital item or vice-versa, the ascertainment of profit or
loss will be incorrect. For example, the revenues earned during an accounting
period are Rs. 10,00,000 and the expenses shown are Rs. 8,00,000, the profit
shall work out as Rs. 2,00,000. On scrutiny of the details, you find that a
revenue item of Rs. 20,000 (an expenditure on repairs of machinery) has been
treated as capital expenditure (added to the cost of machinery and debited to
machinery account, not to repairs account), and hence, does not form part of
the expenses for the period. It means the actual expenses for the period are
Rs. 8,20,000 and not Rs. 8,00,000. So, the correct profit is Rs. 1,80,000, not
Rs. 2,00,000. In other words, the profit has been over stated. Similarly, if any
capital expenditure is wrongly shown as revenue expenditure (for example,
purchase of furniture shown as purchases), it will result in under statement
of profits, and also an under statement of assets. Thus, the financial statements
will not reflect the true and fair view of the affairs of the business. Hence, it is
necessary to identify the correct nature of each item and treat it accordingly
in the book of accounts. It is also important from taxation point of view because
capital profits are taxed differently from revenue profits.
9.3 Financial Statements
It has been emphasised that various users have diverse informational
requirements. Instead of generating particular information useful for specific
users, the business prepares a set of financial statements, which in general
satisfies the informational needs of the users.
Accountancy
The basic objectives of preparing financial statements are :
(a) To present a true and fair view of the financial performance of the
business;
(b) To present a true and fair view of the financial position of the business;
For this purpose, the firm usually prepares the following financial statements:
1. Trading and Profit and Loss Account
2. Balance Sheet
Trading and Profit and Loss account, also known as Income statement,
shows the financial performance in the form of profit earned or loss sustained
by the business. Balance Sheet shows financial position in the form of assets,
liabilities and capital. These are prepared on the basis of trial balance and
additional information, if any.
Example 1
Observe the following trial balance of Ankit and signify correctly the various elements of
accounts and you will notice that the debit balances represent either assets or expenses/
losses and the credit balance represent either equity/liabilities or revenue/gains.

9.4 Trading and Profit and Loss Account
Trading and Profit and Loss account is prepared to determine the profit earned
or loss sustained by the business enterprise during the accounting period. It
is basically a summary of revenues and expenses of the business and calculates
the net figure termed as profit or loss. Profit is revenue less expenses. If
expenses are more than revenues, the figure is termed as loss. Trading and
Profit and Loss account summarises the performance for an accounting period.
It is achieved by transferring the balances of revenues and expenses to the
trading and profit and loss account from the trial balance. Trading and Profit
and Loss account is also an account with Debit and Credit sides. It can be
observed that debit balances (representing expenses) and losses are transferred
to the debit side of the Trading and a Profit and Loss account and credit
balance (representing revenues/gains) are transfered to its credit side.
9.4.1 Relevant Items in Trading and Profit and Loss Account
The different items appearing in the trading and profit and loss account are
explained hereunder:
Items on the debit side
(i) Opening stock : It is the stock of goods in hand at the beginning of the
accounting year. This is the stock of goods which has been carried forward
Accountancy
from the previous year and remains unchanged during the year and
appears in the trial balance. In the trading account it appears on the
debit side because it forms the part of cost of goods sold for the current
accounting year.
(ii) Purchases less returns : Goods, which have been bought for resale
appears as purchases on the debit side of the trading account. They
include both cash as well as credit purchases. Goods which are returned
to suppliers are termed as purchases return. It is shown by way of
deduction from purchases and the computed amount is known as Net
purchases.
(iii) Wages : Wages refer to renumeration paid to workers who are directly
engaged in factory for loading, unloading and production of goods and
are debited to trading account.
(iv) Carriage inwards/Freight inwards: These expenses are the items of
transport expenses, which are incurred on bringing materials/goods
purchased to the place of business. These items are paid in respect of
purchases made during the year and are debited to the trading account.
(v) Fuel/Water/Power/Gas : These items are used in the production process
and hence are part of expenses.
(vi) Packaging material and Packing charges : Cost of packaging material
used in the product are direct expenses  as it refers to small containers
which form part of goods sold. However, the packing refers to the big
containers that are used for transporting the goods and is regarded as
an indirect expense debited to profit and loss account.
(vii) Salaries : These include salaries paid to the administration, godown
and warehouse staff for the services rendered by them for running the
business. If salaries are paid in kind by providing certain facilities (called

(xii) Miscellaneous expenses : Though expenses are classified and booked
under different heads, but certain expenses being of small amount
clubbed together and are called miscellaneous expenses.  In normal
usage these expenses are called Sundry expenses or Trade expenses.
Items on the credit side
(i) Sales less returns : Sales account in trial balance shows gross total
sales(cash as well as credit) made during  the year. It is shown on the
credit side of the trading account. Goods returned by customers are
called return inwards and are shown as deduction from total sales and
the computed amount is known as net sales.
(ii) Other incomes : Besides salaries and other gains and incomes are also
recorded in the profit and loss account. Examples of such incomes are
rent received, dividend received, interest received, discount received,
commission received, etc.

9.4.3 Concept of Gross Profit and Net Profit
The trading and profit and loss can be seen as combination of two accounts,
viz. Trading account and Profit and Loss account. The trading account or the
first part ascertains the gross profit and profit and loss account or the second
part ascertains net profit.
Trading Account
The trading account ascertains the result from basic operational activities of
the business. The basic operational activity involves the manufacturing,
purchasing and selling of goods.  It is prepared to ascertain whether the selling
Financial Statements - I
of goods and/or rendering of services to customers have proved profitable for
the business or not. Purchases is one of the main constituents of expenses in
business organisation. Besides purchases, the remaining expenses are divided
into two categories, viz. direct expenses and indirect expenses.
Direct expenses means all expenses directly connected with the manufacture,
purchase of goods and bringing them to the point of sale. Direct expenses
include carriage inwards, freight inwards, wages, factory lighting, coal, water
and feul, royalty on production, etc. In our example-1, besides purchases,
four more items of expenses are listed. These are wages, salaries, rent of
building and bad debts.  Out of these items, wages is treated as direct expense
while the other three are treated as indirect expenses.
Similarly, sales constitute the main item of revenue for the business. The
excess of sales over purchases and direct expenses is called gross profit.  If
the amount of purchases including direct expenses is more than the sales
revenue, the resultant figure is gross loss. The computation of gross profit
can be shown in the form of equation as :
Gross Profit = Sales – (Purchases + Direct Expenses)
The gross profit or the gross loss is transferred to profit and loss account.
The indirect expenses are transferred to the debit side of the second part,
viz. profit and loss account. All revenue/gains other than sales are transferred
to the credit side of the profit and loss account. If the total of the credit side of
the profit and loss account is more than the total of the debit side, the difference
is the net profit for the period of which it is being prepared. On the other hand,
if the total of the debit side is more than the total of the credit side, the
difference is the net loss incurred by the business firm. In an equation form,
it is shown as follows :
Net Profit = Gross Profit + Other Incomes – Indirect Expenses
Net profit or net loss so computed is transferred to the capital account in
the balance sheet by way of the following entry :
(i) For transfer of net profit
Profit and Loss A/c
To Capital A/c
(ii) For transfer of net loss
Capital A/c
To Profit and Loss A/c

Gross profit, which represents the basic operational activity of the business
is computed as Rs. 42,000. The gross profit is transferred from trading account
to profit and loss account. Besides gross profit, business has earned an income
of Rs. 5,000 as commission received and has spent Rs. 42,500 (Rs. 25,000 +
Rs.13,000 + Rs.4,500) on expenses/losses including salaries, rent and bad
debts. Therefore, the net profit is calculated as Rs. 4,500.

Accountancy
If there is no opening or closing stock, the total of purchases and direct
expenses is taken as Cost of goods sold. In our example, notice that purchases
amount to Rs. 75,000 and wages amounts to  Rs. 8,000. Hence, the cost of
goods sold will be computed using the following formula :
Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses
= Rs.75, 000 + Rs. 8,000
= Rs. 83,000
As there is no unsold stock,the presumption here is that all the goods
purchased have been sold. But in practice, there is  some unsold goods at the
end of the accounting period.
In our example, let us assume that out of the goods purchased amounting
to Rs. 75,000 in the current year, Ankit is able to sell goods costing Rs. 60,000
only. In such a situation,  the business will have an unsold stock of goods
costing Rs. 15,000 in hand, also called closing stock. The amount of cost of
goods sold will be computed as per the following equation :
Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses – Closing Stock
= Rs. 75,000 + Rs. 8,000 – Rs. 15,000
As a result, the amount of gross profit will also change with the existence
of closing stock in business from Rs. 42,000 (as computed in figure 9.4) to
Rs. 57,000 ( refer figure 9.5).

entry :
Closing stock A/c
To Trading A/c
This entry opens a new account of asset, i.e. closing stock Rs. 15,000
which is transferred to the balance sheet. The closing stock shall be an opening
stock for the next year and shall be sold during the year. In most cases,
therefore, the business shall have opening stock as well as closing stock every
year, and the cost of goods sold should be worked as per the following equation:
Cost of Goods Sold = Opening Stock+Purchases Direct Expenses–Closing Stock

9.5 Operating Profit (EBIT)
It is the profit earned through the normal operations and activities of
the business. Operating profit is the excess of operating revenue over
operating expenses. While calculating operating profit, the incomes and
expenses of a purely financial nature are not taken into account. Thus,
operating profit is profit before interest and tax (EBIT). Similarly,
abnormal items such as loss by fire, etc. are also not taken into account.
It is calculated as follows :
Operating profit = Net Profit + Non Operating Expenses – Non Operating Incomes
Refer to the trial balance of Ankit in example 1, you will notice that it
depicts an item relating to 10 % interest on long-term loan raised on
April 01, 2004. The amount of interest works out to Rs. 500 (Rs. 5,000
10/100), which has been shown on the debit side of the trading and profit
and loss account (figure 9.6).

9.6 Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a statement prepared for showing the financial position
of the business summarising its assets and liabilities  at a given date. The
assets reflect debit balances and liabilities (including capital) reflect credit
balances. It is prepared at the end of the accounting period after the trading
Accountancy
and profit and loss account have been prepared. It is called balance sheet
because it is a statement of balances of ledger accounts that have not been
transferred to trading and profit and loss account and are to be carried forward
to the next year with the help of an opening entry made in the journal at the
beginning of the next year.
9.6.1 Preparing Balance Sheet

9.6.2 Relevant Items in the Balance Sheet
Items which are generally included in a balance sheet are explained below :
(1) Current Assets: Current assets are those which are either in the form of
cash or a can be converted into cash within a year. The examples of
such assets are cash in hand/bank, bills receivable, stock of raw
materials, semi-finished goods and finished goods, sundry debtors, short
term investments, prepaid expenses, etc.
Accountancy
(2) Current Liabilities: Current liabilities are those liabilities which are
expected to be paid within a year and which are usually to be paid out of
current assets. The examples of such liabilities are bank overdraft, bills
payable, sundry creditors, short-term loans, outstanding expenses, etc.
(3) Fixed Assets: Fixed assets are those assets, which are held on a long-term
basis in the business. Such assets are not acquired for the purpose of resale,
e.g. land, building, plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, etc. Some
times the term ‘Fixed  Block’ or ‘Block Capital’ is also used for them.
(4) Intangible Assets : These are such assets which cannot be seen or touched.
Goodwill, Patents, Trademarks are some of the examples of intangible assets.
(5) Investments: Investments represent the funds invested in government
securities, shares of a company, etc. They are shown at cost price. If, on
the date of preparation the balance sheet, the market price of investments
is lower than the cost price, a footnote to that effect may be appended to
the balance sheet.
(6) Long-term Liabilities : All liabilities other than the current liabilities are
known as long-term liabilities. Such liabilities are usually payable after
one year of the date of the balance sheet. The important items of long
term liabilities are long-term loans from bank and other financial
institutions.
(7) Capital: It is the excess of assets over liabilities due to outsiders. It
represents the amount originally contributed by the proprietor/ partners
as increased by profits and interest on capital and decreased by losses
drawings and intrest on drawings.
(8) Drawings : Amount withdrawn by the proprietor is termed as drawings
and  has the effect of reducing the balance on his capital account.
Therefore, the drawings account is closed by transferring its balance to
his capital account. However it is shown by way of deduction from capital
in the balance sheet.
9.6.3 Marshalling and Grouping of Assets and Liabilities
A major concern of accounting is about preparing and presenting the financial
statement. The information so provided should be decision useful for the users.
Therefore, it becomes necessary that the items appearing in the balance sheet
should be properly grouped and presented in a particular order.
Marshalling of Assets and Liabilities
In a balance sheet, the assets and liabilities are arranged either in the
order of liquidity or permanence. Arrangement of assets and liabilities in a
particular order is known as Marshalling.
In case of permanence, the most permanent asset or liability is put on the
top in the balance sheet and thereafter the assets are arranged in their reducing
level of permanence.
Financial Statements - I
In the balance sheet of Ankit you will find that furniture is the most
permanent of all the assets. Out of debtors, bank and cash, debtors will take
maximum time to convert back into cash. Bank is less liquid than cash. Cash
is the most liquid of all the assets. Similarly, on the liabilities side, the capital,
being the most important source of finance will tend to remain in the business
for a longer period than the long-term loan. Creditors being a liquid liability
will be discharged in the near future. The balance sheet of Ankit in the order
of permanence is shown in figure 9.10(a).

In case of liquidity, the order is reversed. The information presented in
this manner would enable the user to have a good idea about the life of the
various accounts. The assets account of the relatively permanent nature would
continue in the business for a longer time whereas the less permanent or
more liquid accounts will change their forms in the near future and are likely
to become cash or cash equivalent.

Grouping of Assets and Liabilities
The items appearing in the balance sheet can also be properly grouped. The
term grouping means putting together items of similar nature under a common
heading. For example, the balance of accounts of cash, bank, debtors, etc.
can be grouped and shown under the heading of ‘current assets’ and the
balances of all fixed assets and long-term investment under the heading of
‘non-current assets’.
