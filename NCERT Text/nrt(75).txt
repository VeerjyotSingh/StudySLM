FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning
which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on
the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They
also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures
will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system
of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school
principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on
their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children
generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on
to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis
of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee
responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the
advisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan, and the
Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya, Centre for
Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi for guiding
the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the
development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for
making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and
organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their

resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the
members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the
Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human
Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal
Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and
contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and
continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT
welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to
undertake further revision and refinement.

DEFINING THE FOCUS OF STUDY
What defines the focus of this book? What does it seek to do? How
is it linked to what has been studied in earlier classes?
In Classes VI to VIII we looked at Indian history from early
beginnings to modern times, with a focus on one chronological
period in each year. Then in the books for Classes IX and X, the
frame of reference changed. We looked at a shorter period of time,
focusing specifically on a close study of the contemporary world.
We moved beyond territorial boundaries, beyond the limits of nation
states, to see how different people in different places have played
their part in the making of the modern world. The history of India
became connected to a wider inter-linked history. Subsequently in
Class XI we studied Themes in World History, expanding our
chronological focus, looking at the vast span of years from the
beginning of human life to the present, but selecting only a set of
themes for serious exploration. This year we will study Themes in
Indian History.
The book begins with Harappa and ends with the framing of the
Indian Constitution. What it offers is not a general survey of five
millennia, but a close study of select themes. The history books in
earlier years have already acquainted you with Indian history. It is
time we explored some themes in greater detail.
In choosing the themes we have tried to ensure that we learn
about developments in different spheres – economic, cultural, social,
political, and religious – even as we attempt to break the boundaries
between them. Some themes in the book will introduce you to the
politics of the times and the nature of authority and power; others
explore the way societies are organised, and the way they function
and change; still others tell us about religious life and ritual
practices, about the working of economies, and the changes within
rural and urban societies.
Each of these themes will also allow you to have a closer look at
the historians’ craft. To retrieve the past, historians have to find
sources that make the past accessible. But sources do not just reveal
the past; historians have to grapple with sources, interpret them,
and make them speak. This is what makes history exciting. The
same sources can tell us new things if we ask new questions, and
engage with them in new ways. So we need to see how historians
read sources, and how they discover new things in old sources.
But historians do not only re-examine old records. They discover
new ones. Sometimes these could be chance discoveries.
Archaeologists may unexpectedly come across seals and mounds
that provide clues to the existence of a site of an ancient civilisation.
Rummaging through the dusty records of a district collectorate a

historian may trip over a bundle of records that contain legal cases
of local disputes, and these may open up a new world of village life
several centuries back. Yet are such discoveries only accidents? You
may bump into a bundle of old records in an archive, open it up
and see it, without discovering the significance of the source. The
source may mean nothing to you unless you have relevant questions
in mind. You have to track the source, read the text, follow the clues,
and make the inter-connections before you can reconstruct the past.
The physical discovery of a record does not simply open up the
past. When Alexander Cunningham first saw a Harappan seal, he
could make no sense of it. Only much later was the significance of
the seals discovered.
In fact when historians begin to ask new questions, explore new
themes, they have to often search for new types of sources. If we
wish to know about revolutionaries and rebels, official sources can
reveal only a partial picture, one that will be shaped by official
censure and prejudice. We need to look for other sources – diaries
of rebels, their personal letters, their writings and pronouncements.
And these are not always easy to come by. If we have to understand
experiences of people who suffered the trauma of partition, then
oral sources might reveal more than written sources.
As the vision of history broadens, historians begin tracking new
sources, searching for new clues to understand the past. And when
that happens, the conception of what constitutes a source itself
changes. There was a time when only written records were
acknowledged as authentic. What was written could be verified,
cited, and cross-checked. Oral evidence was never considered a valid
source: who was to guarantee its authenticity and verifiability? This
mistrust of oral sources has not yet disappeared, but oral evidence
has been innovatively used to uncover experiences that no other
record could reveal.
Through the book this year, you will enter the world of historians,
accompany them in their search for new clues, and see how they
carry on their dialogues with the past. You will witness the way they
tease out meaning out of records, read inscriptions, excavate
archaeological sites, make sense of beads and bones, interpret the
epics, look at the stupas and buildings, examine paintings and
photographs, interpret police reports and revenue records, and listen
to the voices of the past. Each theme will explore the peculiarities
and possibilities of one particular type of source. It will discuss what
a source can tell and what it cannot.
This is Part II, of Themes in Indian History. Part III will follow.

Women and men have travelled in search of work, to escape
from natural disasters, as traders, merchants, soldiers,
priests, pilgrims, or driven by a sense of adventure.
Those who visit or come to stay in a new land
invariably encounter a world that is different:
in terms of the landscape or physical
environment as well as customs, languages,
beliefs and practices of people. Many of them
try to adapt to these differences; others,
somewhat exceptional, note them carefully in
accounts, generally recording what they find
unusual or remarkable. Unfortunately, we have
practically no accounts of travel left by women, though
we know that they travelled.
The accounts that survive are often varied in terms of
their subject matter. Some deal with affairs of the court,
while others are mainly focused on religious issues, or
architectural features and monuments. For example, one
of the most important descriptions of the city of
Vijayanagara (Chapter 7) in the fifteenth century comes
from Abdur Razzaq Samarqandi, a diplomat who came
visiting from Herat.
In a few cases, travellers did not go to distant lands. For
example, in the Mughal Empire (Chapters 8 and 9),
administrators sometimes travelled within the
empire and recorded their observations. Some
of them were interested in looking at popular
customs and the folklore and traditions of
their own land.
In this chapter we shall see how our
knowledge of the past can be enriched
through a consideration of descriptions of
social life provided by travellers who visited
the subcontinent, focusing on the accounts of three
men: Al-Biruni who came from Uzbekistan (eleventh
century), Ibn Battuta who came from Morocco, in
northwestern Africa (fourteenth century) and the
Frenchman François Bernier (seventeenth century).

As these authors came from vastly different
social and cultural environments, they were often
more attentive to everyday activities and practices
which were taken for granted by indigenous
writers, for whom these were routine matters, not
worthy of being recorded. It is this difference in
perspective that makes the accounts of travellers
interesting. Who did these travellers write for? As
we will see, the answers vary from one instance
to the next.

1.1 From Khwarizm to the Punjab
Al-Biruni was born in 973, in Khwarizm in present-
day Uzbekistan. Khwarizm was an important centre
of learning, and Al-Biruni received the best
education available at the time. He was well versed
in several languages: Syriac, Arabic, Persian,
Hebrew and Sanskrit. Although he did not know
Greek, he was familiar with the works of Plato
and other Greek philosophers, having read
them in Arabic translations. In 1017, when Sultan
Mahmud invaded Khwarizm, he took several
scholars and poets back to his capital, Ghazni;
Al-Biruni was one of them. He arrived in Ghazni as
a hostage, but gradually developed a liking for the
city, where he spent the rest of his life until his
death at the age of 70.
It was in Ghazni that Al-Biruni developed an
interest in India. This was not unusual. Sanskrit
works on astronomy, mathematics and medicine had
been translated into Arabic from the eighth century
onwards. When the Punjab became a part of the
Ghaznavid empire, contacts with the local population
helped create an environment of mutual trust and
understanding. Al-Biruni spent years in the company
of Brahmana priests and scholars, learning Sanskrit,
and studying religious and philosophical texts. While
his itinerary is not clear, it is likely that he travelled
widely in the Punjab and parts of northern India.
Travel literature was already an accepted part of
Arabic literature by the time he wrote. This literature
dealt with lands as far apart as the Sahara desert
in the west to the River Volga in the north. So, while

few people in India would have read Al-Biruni before
1500, many others outside India may have done so.
1.2 The Kitab-ul-Hind
Al-Biruni’s Kitab-ul-Hind, written in Arabic, is simple
and lucid. It is a voluminous text, divided into
80 chapters on subjects such as religion and
philosophy, festivals, astronomy, alchemy, manners
and customs, social life, weights and measures,
iconography, laws and  metrology.
Generally (though not always), Al-Biruni adopted
a distinctive structure in each chapter, beginning
with a question, following this up with a description
based on Sanskritic traditions, and concluding
with a comparison with other cultures. Some
present-day scholars have argued that this almost
geometric structure, remarkable for its precision and
predictability, owed much to his mathematical
orientation.
Al-Biruni, who wrote in Arabic, probably intended
his work for peoples living along the frontiers of the
subcontinent. He was familiar with translations
and adaptations of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit texts
into Arabic – these ranged from fables to works on
astronomy and medicine. However, he was also
critical about the ways in which these texts were
written, and clearly wanted to improve on them.

2.1 An early globe-trotter
Ibn Battuta’s book of travels, called Rihla, written in
Arabic, provides extremely rich and interesting
details about the social and cultural life in the
subcontinent in the fourteenth century. This
Moroccan traveller was born in Tangier into one of
the most respectable and educated families known
for their expertise in Islamic religious law or shari‘a.
True to the tradition of his family, Ibn Battuta
received literary and scholastic education when he
was quite young.
Unlike most other members of his class, Ibn
Battuta considered experience gained through travels
to be a more important source of knowledge than
books. He just loved travelling, and went to far-off
places, exploring new worlds and peoples. Before he
set off for India in 1332-33, he had made pilgrimage
trips to Mecca, and had already travelled extensively
in Syria, Iraq, Persia, Yemen, Oman and a few
trading ports on the coast of East Africa.
Travelling overland through Central Asia, Ibn
Battuta reached Sind in 1333. He had heard
about Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi,
and lured by his reputation as a generous patron
of arts and letters, set off for Delhi, passing through
Multan and Uch. The Sultan was impressed by
his scholarship, and appointed him the qazi  or judge
of Delhi. He remained in that position for several
years, until he fell out of favour and was thrown
into prison. Once the misunderstanding between
him and the Sultan was cleared, he was
restored to imperial service, and was
ordered in 1342 to proceed to China as the
Sultan’s envoy to the Mongol ruler.
With the new assignment, Ibn Battuta
proceeded to the Malabar coast through
central India. From Malabar he went to
the Maldives, where he stayed for eighteen
months as the qazi, but eventually decided
to proceed to Sri Lanka. He then went back
once more to the Malabar coast and the
Maldives, and before resuming his mission
to China, visited Bengal and Assam as well.
He took a ship to Sumatra, and from there
another ship for the Chinese port town of

Zaytun (now known as Quanzhou). He travelled
extensively in China, going as far as Beijing, but did
not stay for long, deciding to return home in 1347.
His account is often compared with that of Marco
Polo, who visited China (and also India) from his
home base in Venice in the late thirteenth century.
Ibn Battuta meticulously recorded his observations
about new cultures, peoples, beliefs, values, etc.
We need to bear in mind that this globe-trotter was
travelling in the fourteenth century, when it was
much more arduous and hazardous to travel than it
is today. According to Ibn Battuta, it took forty days
to travel from Multan to Delhi and about fifty days
from Sind to Delhi. The distance from Daulatabad
to Delhi was covered in forty days, while that from
Gwalior to Delhi took ten days.

Travelling was also more insecure: Ibn Battuta
was attacked by bands of robbers several times.
In fact he preferred travelling in a caravan along
with companions, but this did not deter highway
robbers. While travelling from Multan to Delhi,
for instance, his caravan was attacked and many
of his fellow travellers lost their lives; those
travellers who survived, including Ibn Battuta,
were severely wounded.
2.2 The “enjoyment of curiosities”
As we have seen, Ibn Battuta was an inveterate
traveller who spent several years travelling through
north Africa, West Asia and parts of Central Asia
(he may even have visited Russia), the Indian
subcontinent and China, before returning to his
native land, Morocco. When he returned, the local
ruler issued instructions that his stories be recorded.

Once the Portuguese arrived in India in about 1500,
a number of them wrote detailed accounts regarding
Indian social customs and religious practices. A few
of them, such as the Jesuit Roberto Nobili, even
translated Indian texts into European languages.
Among the best known of the Portuguese writers
is Duarte Barbosa, who wrote a detailed account of
trade and society in south India. Later, after 1600,
we find growing numbers of Dutch, English and
French travellers coming to India. One of the most
famous was the French jeweller Jean-Baptiste
Tavernier, who travelled to India at least six times.
He was particularly fascinated with the trading
conditions in India, and compared India to Iran and
the Ottoman empire. Some of these travellers, like
the Italian doctor Manucci, never returned to Europe,
and settled down in India.
François Bernier, a Frenchman, was a doctor,
political philosopher and historian. Like many
others, he came to the Mughal Empire in search of
opportunities. He was in India for twelve years, from
1656 to 1668, and was closely associated with the
Mughal court, as a physician to Prince Dara Shukoh,
the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan, and later as
an intellectual and scientist, with Danishmand
Khan, an Armenian noble at the Mughal court.
3.1 Comparing “East” and “West”
Bernier travelled to several parts of the country, and
wrote accounts of what he saw, frequently comparing
what he saw in India with the situation in Europe.
He dedicated his major writing to Louis XIV, the
king of France, and many of his other works were
written in the form of letters to influential officials
and ministers. In virtually every instance Bernier
described what he saw in India as a bleak situation
in comparison to developments in Europe. As we
will see, this assessment was not always accurate.
However, when his works were published, Bernier’s
writings became extremely popular.

Bernier’s works were published in France in
1670-71 and translated into English, Dutch, German
and Italian within the next five years. Between 1670
and 1725 his account was reprinted eight times in
French, and by 1684 it had been reprinted three
times in English. This was in marked contrast to
the accounts in Arabic and Persian, which circulated
as manuscripts and were generally not published
before 1800.

4.1 Overcoming barriers to understanding
As we have seen, travellers often compared what
they saw in the subcontinent with practices
with which they were familiar. Each traveller
adopted  distinct strategies to understand what they
observed.  Al-Biruni, for instance, was aware of the
problems inherent in the task he had set himself.
He discussed several “barriers” that he felt
obstructed understanding. The first amongst these
was language. According to him, Sanskrit was so
different from Arabic and Persian that ideas and
concepts could not be easily translated from one
language into another.
The second barrier he identified was the difference
in religious beliefs and practices. The self-absorption
and consequent insularity of the local population
according to him, constituted the third barrier.
What is interesting is that even though he was aware
of these problems, Al-Biruni depended almost
exclusively on the works of Brahmanas, often citing
passages from the Vedas, the Puranas, the Bhagavad
Gita, the works of Patanjali, the Manusmriti, etc., to
provide an understanding of Indian society.
4.2 Al-Biruni’s description of the caste system
Al-Biruni tried to explain the caste system by looking
for parallels in other societies. He noted that in
ancient Persia, four social categories were
recognised: those of knights and princes; monks,
fire-priests and lawyers; physicians, astronomers
and other scientists; and finally, peasants and
artisans. In other words, he attempted to suggest
that social divisions were not unique to India. At
the same time he pointed out that within Islam all
men were considered equal, differing only in their
observance of piety.
In spite of his acceptance of the Brahmanical
description of the caste system, Al-Biruni disapproved
of the notion of pollution. He remarked that
everything which falls into a state of impurity strives
and succeeds in regaining its original condition of
purity. The sun cleanses the air, and the salt in the
sea prevents the water from becoming polluted. If it

As we have seen, Al-Biruni’s description of the
caste system was deeply influenced by his study
of normative Sanskrit texts which laid down the rules
governing the system from the point of view of
the Brahmanas. However, in real life the system
was not quite as rigid. For instance, the categories
defined as antyaja (literally, born outside the system)
were often expected to provide inexpensive labour to
both  peasants and zamindars (see also Chapter 8).
In other words, while they were often subjected to
social oppression, they were included within
economic networks.

By the time Ibn Battuta arrived in Delhi in the
fourteenth century, the subcontinent was part of a
global network of communication that stretched from
China in the east to north-west Africa and Europe
in the west. As we have seen, Ibn Battuta himself
travelled extensively through these lands, visiting
sacred shrines, spending time with learned men and
rulers, often officiating as qazi, and enjoying the
cosmopolitan culture of urban centres where people
who spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkish and other
languages, shared ideas, information and anecdotes.
These included stories about men noted for their
piety, kings who could be both cruel and generous,
and about the lives of ordinary men and women;
anything that was unfamiliar was particularly
highlighted in order to ensure that the listener or
the reader was suitably impressed by accounts of
distant yet accessible worlds.
5.1 The coconut and the paan
Some of the best examples of Ibn Battuta’s strategies
of representation are evident in the ways in which
he described the coconut and the paan, two kinds of
plant produce that were completely unfamiliar to
his audience.

5.2 Ibn Battuta and Indian cities
Ibn Battuta found cities in the subcontinent full of
exciting opportunities for those who had the
necessary drive, resources and skills. They were
densely populated and prosperous, except for the
occasional disruptions caused by wars and
invasions. It appears from Ibn Battuta’s account that
most cities had crowded streets and bright and
colourful markets that were stacked with a wide
variety of goods. Ibn Battuta described Delhi as a
vast city, with a great population, the largest in India.
Daulatabad (in Maharashtra) was no less, and easily
rivalled Delhi in size.

The bazaars were not only places of economic
transactions, but also the hub of social and cultural
activities. Most bazaars had a mosque and a temple,
and in some of them at least, spaces were marked for
public performances by dancers, musicians and singers.
While Ibn Battuta was not particularly concerned
with explaining the prosperity of towns, historians have
used his account to suggest that towns derived a
significant portion of their wealth through the
appropriation of surplus from villages. Ibn Battuta
found Indian agriculture very productive because of
the fertility of the soil, which allowed farmers to
cultivate two crops a year. He also noted that the
subcontinent was well integrated with inter-Asian
networks of trade and commerce, with Indian
manufactures being in great demand in both West Asia
and Southeast Asia, fetching huge profits for artisans
and merchants. Indian textiles, particularly cotton
cloth, fine muslins, silks, brocade and satin, were in
great demand. Ibn Battuta informs us that certain
varieties of fine muslin were so expensive that they
could be worn only by the nobles and the very rich.

5.3 A unique system of communication
The state evidently took special measures to
encourage merchants. Almost all trade routes were
well supplied with inns and guest houses. Ibn
Battuta was also amazed by the efficiency of the
postal system which allowed merchants to not only
send information and remit credit across long
distances, but also to dispatch goods required at
short notice. The postal system was so efficient that
while it took fifty days to reach Delhi from Sind,
the news reports of spies would reach the Sultan
through the postal system in just five days.

If Ibn Battuta chose to describe everything that
impressed and excited him because of its novelty,
François Bernier belonged to a different intellectual
tradition. He was far more preoccupied with
comparing and contrasting what he saw in India
with the situation in Europe in general and France
in particular, focusing on situations which he
considered depressing. His idea seems to have been
to influence policy-makers and the intelligentsia to
ensure that they made what he considered to be the
“right” decisions.
Bernier’s Travels in the Mughal Empire is marked
by detailed observations, critical insights and
reflection. His account contains discussions trying
to place the history of the Mughals within some sort
of a universal framework. He constantly compared
Mughal India with contemporary Europe, generally
emphasising the superiority of the latter. His
representation of India works on the model of
binary opposition, where India is presented as the
inverse of Europe. He also ordered the perceived
differences hierarchically, so that India appeared to
be inferior to the Western world.
6.1 The question of landownership
According to Bernier, one of the fundamental
differences between Mughal India and Europe was
the lack of private property in land in the former.
He was a firm believer in the virtues of private
property, and saw crown ownership of land as
being harmful for both the state and its people. He
thought that in the Mughal Empire the emperor
owned all the land and distributed it among his
nobles, and that this had disastrous consequences
for the economy and society. This perception was
not unique to Bernier, but is found in most
travellers’ accounts of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.
Owing to crown ownership of land, argued Bernier,
landholders could not pass on their land to their
children. So they were averse to any long-term
investment in the sustenance and expansion of
production. The absence of private property in land
had, therefore, prevented the emergence of the class
of “improving” landlords (as in Western Europe) with

a concern to maintain or improve the land. It had
led to the uniform ruination of agriculture, excessive
oppression of the peasantry and a continuous decline
in the living standards of all sections of society, except
the ruling aristocracy.

As an extension of this, Bernier described Indian
society as consisting of undifferentiated masses of
impoverished people, subjugated by a small minority
of a very rich and powerful ruling class. Between
the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich,
there was no social group or class worth the name.
Bernier confidently asserted: “There is no middle
state in India.”

problems faced by peasants in the
subcontinent? Do you think his description
would have served to strengthen his case?

This, then, is how Bernier saw the Mughal Empire
– its king was the king of “beggars and barbarians”;
its cities and towns were ruined and contaminated
with “ill air”; and its fields, “overspread with bushes”
and full of “pestilential marishes”. And, all this was
because of one reason: crown ownership of land.
Curiously, none of the Mughal official documents
suggest that the state was the sole owner of land.
For instance, Abu’l Fazl, the sixteenth-century
official chronicler of Akbar’s reign, describes the land
revenue as “remunerations of sovereignty”, a claim
made by the ruler on his subjects for the protection
he provided rather than as rent on land that he
owned. It is possible that European travellers
regarded such claims as rent because land revenue
demands were often very high. However, this was
actually not a rent or even a land tax, but a tax on
the crop (for more details, see Chapter 8).
Bernier’s descriptions influenced Western
theorists from the eighteenth century onwards.  The
French philosopher Montesquieu, for instance, used
this account to develop the idea of oriental despotism,
according to which rulers in Asia (the Orient or the
East) enjoyed absolute authority over their subjects,
who were kept in conditions of subjugation and
poverty, arguing that all land belonged to the king
and that private property was non-existent.
According to this view, everybody, except the emperor
and his nobles, barely managed to survive.
This idea was further developed as the concept of
the Asiatic mode of production by Karl Marx in the
nineteenth century. He argued that in India (and
other Asian countries), before colonialism, surplus
was appropriated by the state. This led to the
emergence of a society that was composed of a large
number of autonomous and (internally) egalitarian
village communities. The imperial court presided
over these village communities, respecting their
autonomy as long as the flow of surplus was
unimpeded. This was regarded as a stagnant system.
However, as we will see (Chapter 8), this picture
of rural society was far from true. In fact, during
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, rural
society was characterised by considerable social and
economic differentiation. At one end of the spectrum
were the big zamindars, who enjoyed superior rights
in land and, at the other, the “untouchable” landless

labourers. In between was the big peasant, who used
hired labour and engaged in commodity production, and
the smaller peasant who could barely produce for his
subsistence.
6.2 A more complex social reality
While Bernier’s preoccupation with projecting the
Mughal state as tyrannical is obvious, his descriptions
occasionally hint at a more complex social reality. For
instance, he felt that artisans had no incentive to
improve the quality of their manufactures, since profits
were appropriated by the state. Manufactures were,
consequently, everywhere in decline.  At the same time,
he conceded that vast quantities of the world’s precious
metals flowed into India, as manufactures were exported
in exchange for gold and silver. He also noticed the
existence of a prosperous merchant community,
engaged in long-distance exchange.

In fact, during the seventeenth century about
15 per cent of the population lived in towns. This
was, on average, higher than the proportion of urban
population in Western Europe in the same period.
In spite of this Bernier described Mughal cities as
“camp towns”, by which he meant towns that owed
their existence, and depended for their survival,
on the imperial camp. He believed that these came
into existence when the imperial court moved in
and rapidly declined when it moved out. He
suggested that they did not have viable social and
economic foundations but were dependent on
imperial patronage.
As in the case of the question of landownership,
Bernier was drawing an oversimplified picture.
There were all kinds of towns: manufacturing
towns, trading towns, port-towns, sacred centres,
pilgrimage towns, etc. Their existence is an index
of the prosperity of merchant communities and
professional classes.
Merchants often had strong community or kin ties,
and were organised into their own caste-cum-
occupational bodies. In western India these groups
were called mahajans, and their chief, the sheth. In
urban centres such as Ahmedabad the mahajans
were collectively represented by the chief of the
merchant community who was called the nagarsheth.
Other urban groups included professional
classes such as physicians (hakim or vaid), teachers
(pundit or mulla), lawyers (wakil ), painters,
architects, musicians, calligraphers, etc. While
some depended on imperial patronage, many made
their living by serving other patrons, while still
others served ordinary people in crowded markets
or bazaars.

Travellers who left written accounts were
generally men who were interested in and
sometimes intrigued by the condition of
women in the subcontinent. Sometimes they
took social inequities for granted as a
“natural” state of affairs. For instance,
slaves were openly sold in markets, like any
other commodity, and were regularly
exchanged as gifts. When Ibn Battuta
reached Sind he purchased “horses, camels
and slaves” as gifts for Sultan Muhammad
bin Tughlaq. When he reached Multan, he
presented the governor with, “a slave and
horse together with raisins and almonds”.
Muhammad bin Tughlaq, informs Ibn
Battuta, was so happy with the sermon of a
preacher named Nasiruddin that he gave him
“a hundred thousand tankas (coins) and
two hundred slaves”.
It appears from Ibn Battuta’s account that
there was considerable differentiation among
slaves. Some female slaves in the service of
the Sultan were experts in music and dance,
and Ibn Battuta enjoyed their performance
at the wedding of the Sultan’s sister. Female
slaves were also employed by the Sultan to
keep a watch on his nobles.
Slaves were generally used for domestic
labour, and Ibn Battuta found their services
particularly indispensable for carrying
women and men on palanquins or dola. The
price of slaves, particularly female slaves
required for domestic labour, was very  low,
and most families who could afford to do so
kept  at least one or two of them.
Contemporary European travellers and
writers often highlighted the treatment of
women as a crucial marker of difference
between Western and Eastern societies. Not
surprisingly, Bernier chose the practice of
sati for detailed description. He noted that
while some women seemed to embrace death
cheerfully, others were forced to die.

However, women’s lives revolved around much else
besides the practice of sati. Their labour was crucial
in both agricultural and non-agricultural production.
Women from merchant families participated in
commercial activities, sometimes even taking
mercantile disputes to the court of law. It therefore
seems unlikely that women were confined to the
private spaces of their homes.
You may have noticed that travellers’ accounts
provide us with a tantalising glimpse of the lives of
men and women during these centuries. However,
their observations were often shaped by the contexts
from which they came. At the same time, there were
many aspects of social life that these travellers did
not notice.
Also relatively unknown are the experiences and
observations of men (and possibly women) from the
subcontinent who crossed seas and mountains and
ventured into lands beyond the subcontinent. What
did they see and hear? How were their relations with
peoples of distant lands shaped? What were the
languages they used? These and other questions will
hopefully be systematically addressed by historians
in the years to come.

Numerous are the instances of handsome pieces

so perfectly articles of European manufacture that
the difference between the original and copy can

it may be doubted if the exquisite workmanship

We saw in Chapter 4 that by the mid-first
millennium CE the landscape of the subcontinent
was dotted with a variety of religious structures –
stupas, monasteries, temples. If these typified
certain religious beliefs and practices, others have
been reconstructed from textual traditions,
including the Puranas, many of which received
their present shape around the same time, and yet
others remain only faintly visible in textual and
visual records.
New textual sources available from this period
include compositions attributed to poet-saints,
most of whom expressed themselves orally in
regional languages used by ordinary people. These
compositions, which were often set to music, were
compiled by disciples or devotees, generally after
the death of the poet-saint. What is more, these
traditions were fluid – generations of devotees tended
to elaborate on the original message, and occasionally
modified or even abandoned some of the ideas that
appeared problematic or irrelevant in different
political, social or cultural contexts. Using these
sources thus poses a challenge to historians.
Historians also draw on hagiographies or
biographies of saints written by their followers (or
members of their religious sect). These may not be
literally accurate, but allow a glimpse into the ways
in which devotees perceived the lives of these path-
breaking women and men.
As we will see, these sources provide us with
insights into a scenario characterised by dynamism
and diversity. Let us look at some elements of these
more closely.

Perhaps the most striking feature of this phase is
the increasing visibility of a wide range of gods and
goddesses in sculpture as well as in texts. At one
level, this indicates the continued and even extended
worship of the major deities – Vishnu, Shiva and
the goddess – each of whom was visualised in a
variety of forms.
1.1 The integration of cults
Historians who have tried to understand these
developments suggest that there were at least two
processes at work. One was a process of disseminating
Brahmanical ideas. This is exemplified by the
composition, compilation and preservation of Puranic
texts in simple Sanskrit verse, explicitly meant to
be accessible to women and Shudras, who were
generally excluded from Vedic learning. At the same
time, there was a second process at work – that of
the Brahmanas accepting and reworking the beliefs
and practices of these and other social categories. In
fact, many beliefs and practices were shaped through
a continuous dialogue between what sociologists have
described as “great” Sanskritic Puranic traditions
and “little” traditions throughout the land.
One of the most striking examples of this process
is evident at Puri, Orissa, where the principal deity
was identified, by the twelfth century, as Jagannatha
(literally, the lord of the world), a form of Vishnu.
Fig. 6.2

sister Subhadra (centre) and his


If you compare Fig. 6.2 with Fig. 4.26 (Chapter 4)
you will notice that the deity is represented in a
very different way. In this instance, a local deity,
whose image was and continues to be made of wood
by local tribal specialists, was recognised as a form
of Vishnu. At the same time, Vishnu was visualised
in a way that was very different from that in other
parts of the country.
Such instances of integration are evident
amongst goddess cults as well. Worship of the
goddess, often simply in the form of a stone smeared
with ochre, was evidently widespread. These local
deities were often incorporated within the Puranic
framework by providing them with an identity as a
wife of the principal male deities – sometimes they
were equated with Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, in
other instances, with Parvati, the wife of Shiva.
1.2 Difference and conflict
Often associated with the goddess were forms
of worship that were classified as Tantric. Tantric
practices were widespread in several parts of the
subcontinent – they were open to women and
men, and practitioners often ignored differences
of caste and class within the ritual context. Many
of these ideas influenced Shaivism as well as
Buddhism,  especially in the eastern, northern and
southern parts of the subcontinent.
All of these somewhat divergent and even disparate
beliefs and practices would  come to be classified as
Hindu over the course of the next millennium. The
divergence is perhaps most stark if we compare Vedic
and Puranic traditions. The principal deities of the
Vedic pantheon, Agni, Indra and Soma, become
marginal figures, rarely visible in textual or visual
representations. And while we can catch a glimpse
of Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess in Vedic mantras,
these have little in common with the elaborate
Puranic mythologies. However, in spite of these
obvious discrepancies, the Vedas continued to be
revered as authoritative.
Not surprisingly, there were sometimes conflicts as
well – those who valued the Vedic tradition often
condemned practices that went beyond the closely
regulated contact with the divine through the
performance of sacrifices or precisely chanted mantras.
On the other hand those engaged in Tantric practices

Sculpture of a Buddhist goddess,
Marichi (c.tenth century, Bihar),
an example of the process of
integration of different religious
beliefs and practices
2015-16(20/01/2015)
frequently ignored the authority of the Vedas. Also,
devotees often tended to project their chosen deity,
either Vishnu or Shiva, as supreme. Relations with
other traditions, such as Buddhism or Jainism, were
also often fraught with tension if not open conflict.
The traditions of devotion or bhakti need to be
located within this context.  Devotional worship had
a long history of almost a thousand years before
the period we are considering. During this time,
expressions of devotion ranged from the routine
worship of deities within temples to ecstatic
adoration where devotees attained a trance-like
state. The singing and chanting of devotional
compositions was often a part of such modes of
worship. This was particularly true of the Vaishnava
and Shaiva sects.


In the course of the evolution of these forms of
worship,  in many instances, poet-saints emerged
as leaders around whom there developed a
community of devotees. Further, while Brahmanas
remained important intermediaries between gods and
devotees in several forms of bhakti, these traditions
also accommodated and acknowledged women and
the “lower castes”, categories considered ineligible
for liberation within the orthodox Brahmanical
framework. What also characterised traditions of
bhakti was a remarkable diversity.
At a different level, historians of religion often
classify bhakti traditions into two broad categories:
saguna (with attributes) and nirguna (without
attributes). The former included traditions that
focused on the worship of specific deities such
as Shiva, Vishnu and his avatars (incarnations) and
forms of the goddess or Devi, all often conceptualised
in anthropomorphic forms. Nirguna bhakti on the
other hand was worship of an abstract form of god.
2.1 The Alvars and Nayanars of Tamil Nadu
Some of the earliest bhakti movements (c. sixth
century) were led by the Alvars (literally, those who
are “immersed” in devotion to Vishnu) and Nayanars
(literally, leaders who were devotees of Shiva). They
travelled from place to place singing hymns in Tamil
in praise of their gods.


During their travels the Alvars and Nayanars
identified certain shrines as abodes of their chosen
deities. Very often large temples were later built at
these sacred places. These developed as centres of
pilgrimage. Singing compositions of these poet-saints
became part of temple rituals in these shrines, as
did worship of the saints’ images.
2.2 Attitudes towards caste
Some historians suggest that the Alvars and
Nayanars initiated a movement of protest against
the caste system and the dominance of Brahmanas
or at least attempted to reform the system. To some
extent this is corroborated by the fact that bhaktas
hailed from diverse social backgrounds ranging from
Brahmanas to artisans and cultivators and even
from castes considered “untouchable”.
The importance of the traditions of the Alvars
and Nayanars was sometimes indicated by the
claim that their compositions were as important
as the Vedas. For instance, one of the major
anthologies of compositions by the Alvars, the Nalayira
Divyaprabandham, was frequently described as the
Tamil Veda, thus claiming that the text was as
significant as the four Vedas in Sanskrit that were
cherished by the Brahmanas.
2.3 Women devotees
Perhaps one of the most striking features of these
traditions was the presence of women. For instance,
the compositions of Andal, a woman Alvar, were
widely sung (and continue to be sung to date). Andal
saw herself as the beloved of Vishnu; her verses
express her love for the deity. Another woman,
Karaikkal Ammaiyar, a devotee of Shiva, adopted
the path of extreme asceticism in order to attain

2.4 Relations with the state
We saw in Chapter 2 that there were several
important chiefdoms in the Tamil region in the early
first millennium CE. From the second half of the first
millennium there is evidence for states, including
those of the Pallavas and Pandyas (c. sixth to ninth
centuries CE). While Buddhism and Jainism had
been prevalent in this region for several centuries,
drawing support from merchant and artisan
communities, these religious traditions received
occasional royal patronage.
Interestingly, one of the major themes in Tamil
bhakti hymns is the poets’ opposition to Buddhism
and Jainism. This is particularly marked in the
2015-16(20/01/2015)

compositions of the Nayanars. Historians have
attempted to explain this hostility by suggesting that
it was due to competition between members of
other religious traditions for royal patronage. What
is evident is that the powerful Chola rulers (ninth
to thirteenth centuries) supported Brahmanical
and bhakti traditions, making land grants and
constructing temples for Vishnu and Shiva.
In fact, some of the most magnificent Shiva
temples, including those at Chidambaram, Thanjavur
and Gangaikondacholapuram, were constructed
under the patronage of Chola rulers. This was also
the period when some of the most spectacular
representations of Shiva in bronze sculpture were
produced. Clearly, the visions of the Nayanars
inspired artists.
Both Nayanars and Alvars were revered by the
Vellala peasants. Not surprisingly, rulers tried to
win their support as well. The Chola kings, for
instance, often attempted to claim divine support
and proclaim their own power and status by building
splendid temples that were adorned
with stone and metal sculpture to
recreate the visions of these popular
saints who sang in the language of
the people.
These kings also introduced the
singing of Tamil Shaiva hymns in
the temples under royal patronage,
taking the initiative to collect and
organise them into a text (Tevaram).
Further, inscriptional evidence from
around 945 suggests that the Chola
ruler Parantaka I had consecrated
metal images of Appar, Sambandar
and Sundarar in a Shiva temple.
These were carried in processions
during the festivals of these saints.

The twelfth century witnessed the emergence of a
new movement in Karnataka, led by a Brahmana
named Basavanna (1106-68) who was initially a
Jaina and a minister in the court of a Chalukya
king. His followers were known as Virashaivas
(heroes of Shiva) or Lingayats (wearers of the linga).
Lingayats continue to be an important community
in the region to date. They worship Shiva in his
manifestation as a linga, and men usually wear a
small linga in a silver case on a loop strung over the
left shoulder. Those who are revered include the
jangama or wandering monks. Lingayats believe
that on death the devotee will be united with Shiva
and will not return to this world. Therefore they do
not practise funerary rites such as cremation,
prescribed in the Dharmashastras. Instead, they
ceremonially bury their dead.
The Lingayats challenged the idea of caste and
the “pollution” attributed to certain groups by
Brahmanas. They also questioned the theory of
rebirth. These won them followers amongst those
who were marginalised within the Brahmanical
social order. The Lingayats also encouraged certain
practices disapproved in the Dharmashastras,
such as post-puberty marriage and the remarriage
of widows. Our understanding of the Virashaiva
tradition is derived from vachanas (literally, sayings)
composed in Kannada by women and men who
joined the movement.

During the same period, in north India deities such as
Vishnu and Shiva were worshipped in temples, often built
with the support of rulers. However, historians have not
found evidence of anything resembling the compositions
of the Alvars and Nayanars till the fourteenth century.
How do we account for this difference?
Some historians point out that in north India this
was the period when several Rajput states emerged. In
most of these states Brahmanas occupied positions of
importance, performing a range of secular and ritual
functions. There seems to have been little or no attempt
to challenge their position directly.
At the same time other
religious leaders, who did not
function within the orthodox
Brahmanical framework, were
gaining ground. These included
the Naths, Jogis and Siddhas.
Many of them came
artisanal groups, including
weavers, who were becoming
increasingly important with the
development of organised craft
production. Demand for such
production grew with the
emergence of new urban centres,
and long-distance trade with
Central Asia and West Asia.
Many of these new religious
leaders
questioned
authority of the Vedas, and
expressed themselves in languages spoken by ordinary
people, which developed over centuries into the ones
used today. However, in spite of their popularity these
religious leaders were not in a position to win the
support of the ruling elites.
A new element in this situation was the coming of
the Turks which culminated in the establishment of the
Delhi Sultanate (thirteenth century). This undermined
the power of many of the Rajput states and the
Brahmanas who were associated with these kingdoms.
This was accompanied by marked changes in the realm
of culture and religion. The coming of the sufis
(Section 6) was a significant part of these developments.

Ulama (plural of alim, or one
who knows) are scholars of
Islamic studies. As preservers of
this tradition they perform
various religious, juridical and
teaching functions.

Just as the regions within the subcontinent were
not isolated from one another, so too, contact with
lands beyond the seas and mountains had existed
for millennia. Arab merchants, for instance,
frequented ports along the western coast in the first
millennium CE, while Central Asian people settled
in the north-western parts of the subcontinent
during the same period. From the seventh century,
with the advent of Islam, these regions became part
of what is often termed the Islamic world.
5.1 Faiths of rulers and subjects
One axis of understanding the significance of these
connections that is frequently adopted is to focus on
the religions of ruling elites. In 711 an Arab general
named Muhammad Qasim conquered Sind, which
became part of the Caliph’s domain. Later (c. thirteenth
century) the Turks and Afghans established the
Delhi Sultanate. This was followed by the formation
of Sultanates in the Deccan and other parts of the
subcontinent; Islam was an acknowledged religion of
rulers in several areas. This continued with the
establishment of the Mughal Empire in the sixteenth
century as well as in many of the regional states that
emerged in the eighteenth century.
Theoretically, Muslim rulers were to be guided by
the ulama, who were expected to ensure that they
ruled according to the shari‘a. Clearly, the situation
was complicated in the subcontinent, where there
were populations that did not subscribe to Islam.
It is in this context that the category of the zimmi,
meaning protected (derived from the Arabic word
zimma, protection) developed for people who followed
revealed scriptures, such as the Jews and Christians,
and lived under Muslim rulership. They paid a tax
called jizya and gained the right to be protected by
Muslims.  In India this status was extended to Hindus
as well. As you will see (Chapter 9), rulers such as
the Mughals came to regard themselves as emperors
of not just Muslims but of all peoples.
In effect, rulers often adopted a fairly flexible policy
towards their subjects. For instance, several rulers
gave land endowments and granted tax exemptions
to Hindu, Jaina, Zoroastrian, Christian and Jewish
religious institutions and also expressed respect and

5.2 The popular practice of Islam
The developments that followed the coming of Islam
were not confined to ruling elites; in fact they
permeated far and wide, through the subcontinent,
amongst different social strata – peasants, artisans,
warriors, merchants, to name a few. All those who
adopted Islam accepted, in principle, the five “pillars”
of the faith: that there is one God, Allah, and Prophet
Muhammad is his messenger (shahada); offering
prayers five times a day (namaz/salat); giving alms
(zakat); fasting during the month of Ramzan (sawm);
and performing the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj ).
However, these universal features were often
overlaid with diversities in practice derived from
sectarian affiliations (Sunni, Shi‘a), and the influence
of local customary practices of converts from different
social milieus. For example, the Khojahs, a branch
of the Ismailis (a Shi‘a sect), developed new modes
of communication, disseminating ideas derived from
the Qur’an through indigenous literary genres. These
included the ginan (derived from the Sanskrit jnana,
meaning “knowledge”), devotional poems in Punjabi,
Multani, Sindhi, Kachchi, Hindi and Gujarati, sung
in special ragas during daily prayer meetings.
Elsewhere, Arab Muslim traders who settled
along the Malabar coast (Kerala) adopted the
local language, Malayalam. They also adopted
local customs such as matriliny (Chapter 3) and
matrilocal residence.
The complex blend of a universal faith with local
traditions is perhaps best exemplified in the
architecture of mosques. Some architectural features
Fig. 6.8
A Khojaki manuscript
The ginan were transmitted
orally before being recorded in the
Khojaki script that was derived
from the local landa (“clipped”
mercantile script) used by the
linguistically diverse community
of Khojahs in the Punjab, Sind
and Gujarat.
Matrilocal residence is a
practice where women after
marriage remain in their natal
home with their children and
the husbands may come to stay
with them.

of mosques are universal – such as
their orientation towards Mecca,
evident in the placement of the mihrab
(prayer niche) and the minbar (pulpit).
However, there are several features
that show variations – such as roofs
and building materials (see Figs. 6.9,
6.10 and 6.11).
5.3 Names for communities
We often take the terms Hindu and
Muslim for granted, as labels for
religious communities. Yet, these
terms did not gain currency for a very
long time. Historians who have studied
Sanskrit texts and inscriptions dating
between the eighth and fourteenth
centuries point out that the term
musalman or Muslim was virtually
never used. Instead, people were
occasionally identified in terms of
the region from which they came.
So, the Turkish rulers were designated
as Turushka, Tajika were people from
Tajikistan  and Parashika were people
from Persia. Sometimes, terms used
for other peoples were applied to the
new migrants. For instance, the
Turks and Afghans were referred to
as Shakas (Chapters 2 and 3) and
Yavanas (a term used for Greeks).
A more general term for these migrant
communities was mlechchha, indicating that they did
not observe the norms of caste society and spoke
languages that were not derived from Sanskrit. Such
terms sometimes had a derogatory connotation, but they
rarely denoted a distinct religious community of Muslims
in  opposition to Hindus. And as we saw (Chapter 5),
the term “Hindu” was used in a variety of ways, not
necessarily restricted to a religious connotation.

In the early centuries of Islam a group of religious-
minded people called sufis turned to asceticism and
mysticism in protest against the growing materialism
of the Caliphate as a religious and political institution.
They were critical of the dogmatic definitions and
scholastic methods of interpreting the Qur’an and sunna
(traditions of the Prophet) adopted by theologians.
Instead, they laid emphasis on seeking salvation
through intense devotion and love for God by following
His commands, and by following the example of the
Prophet Muhammad whom they regarded as a perfect
human being. The sufis thus sought an interpretation
of the Qur’an on the basis of their personal experience.
6.1 Khanqahs and silsilas
By the eleventh century Sufism evolved into a well-
developed movement with a body of literature on
Quranic studies and sufi practices. Institutionally,
the sufis began to organise communities around the
hospice or khanqah (Persian) controlled by a teaching
master known as shaikh (in Arabic), pir or murshid (in
Persian). He enrolled disciples (murids) and appointed
a successor (khalifa). He established rules for spiritual
conduct and interaction between inmates as well as
between laypersons and the master.
Sufi silsilas began to crystallise in different parts of
the Islamic world around the twelfth century. The word
silsila literally means a chain, signifying a continuous
link between master and disciple, stretching as an
unbroken spiritual genealogy to the Prophet Muhammad.
It was through this channel that spiritual power and
blessings were transmitted to devotees. Special rituals
of initiation were developed in which initiates took an
oath of allegiance, wore a patched garment, and shaved
their hair.
When the shaikh died, his tomb-shrine (dargah, a
Persian term meaning court) became the centre of
devotion for his followers. This encouraged the practice
of pilgrimage or ziyarat to his grave, particularly on
his death anniversary or urs (or marriage, signifying
the union of his soul with God). This was because
people believed that in death saints were united with
God, and were thus closer to Him than when living.
People sought their blessings to attain material and
spiritual benefits. Thus evolved the cult of the shaikh
revered as wali.

6.2 Outside the khanqah
Some mystics initiated movements based on a
radical interpretation of sufi ideals. Many scorned
the khanqah and took to mendicancy and observed
celibacy. They ignored rituals and observed extreme
forms of asceticism. They were known by different
names – Qalandars, Madaris, Malangs, Haidaris,
etc. Because of their deliberate defiance of the shari‘a
they were often referred to as be-shari‘a, in contrast
to the ba-shari‘a sufis who complied with it.

Of the groups of sufis who migrated to India in
the late twelfth century, the Chishtis were the
most influential. This was because they adapted
successfully to the local environment and adopted
several features of Indian devotional traditions.
7.1 Life in the Chishti khanqah
The khanqah was the centre of social life. We know
about Shaikh Nizamuddin’s hospice (c. fourteenth
century) on the banks of the river Yamuna in
Ghiyaspur, on the outskirts of what was then the
city of Delhi. It comprised several small rooms and
a big hall ( jama’at khana) where the inmates and
visitors lived and prayed. The inmates included family
members of the Shaikh, his attendants and disciples.
The Shaikh lived in a small room on the roof of the
hall where he met visitors in the morning and evening.
A veranda surrounded the courtyard, and a boundary
wall ran around the complex. On one occasion, fearing
a Mongol invasion, people from the neighbouring areas
flocked into the khanqah to seek refuge.
Wali (plural auliya) or friend of
God was a sufi who claimed
proximity to Allah, acquiring
His Grace (barakat) to perform
miracles (karamat).

There was an open kitchen (langar), run on futuh
(unasked-for charity). From morning till late night
people from all walks of life – soldiers, slaves,
singers, merchants, poets, travellers, rich and
poor, Hindu jogis (yogi) and qalandars – came
seeking discipleship, amulets for healing, and the
intercession of the Shaikh in various matters.  Other
visitors included poets such as Amir Hasan Sijzi
and Amir Khusrau and the court historian Ziyauddin
Barani, all of whom wrote about the Shaikh.
Practices that were adopted, including bowing before
the Shaikh, offering water to visitors, shaving the
heads of initiates, and yogic exercises, represented
attempts to assimilate local traditions.
Shaikh Nizamuddin appointed several spiritual
successors and deputed them to set up hospices in
various parts of the subcontinent. As a result the
teachings, practices and organisation of the Chishtis
as well as the fame of the Shaikh spread rapidly.
This in turn drew pilgrims to his shrine, and also to
the shrines of his spiritual ancestors.
7.2 Chishti devotionalism: ziyarat and qawwali
Pilgrimage, called ziyarat, to tombs of sufi saints is
prevalent all over the Muslim world. This practice
is an occasion for seeking the sufi’s spiritual grace
(barakat). For more than seven centuries people of
various creeds, classes and social backgrounds have
expressed their devotion at the dargahs of the five
great Chishti saints (see chart on p.154). Amongst
these, the most revered shrine is that of Khwaja
Muinuddin, popularly known as “Gharib Nawaz”
(comforter of the poor).
The earliest textual references to Khwaja
Muinuddin’s dargah date to the fourteenth century.
It was evidently popular because of the austerity
and piety of its Shaikh, the greatness of his spiritual
successors, and the patronage of royal visitors.
Muhammad bin Tughlaq (ruled, 1324-51) was the

first Sultan to visit the shrine, but the earliest
construction to house the tomb was funded in the
late fifteenth century by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Khalji
of Malwa. Since the shrine was located on the trade
route linking Delhi and Gujarat, it attracted a lot
of travellers.
By the sixteenth century the shrine had become
very popular; in fact it was the spirited singing of
pilgrims bound for Ajmer that inspired Akbar
to visit the tomb. He went there fourteen times,
sometimes two or three times a year, to seek
blessings for new conquests, fulfilment of vows, and
the birth of sons. He maintained this tradition until
1580. Each of these visits was celebrated by
generous gifts, which were recorded in imperial
documents. For example, in 1568 he offered a huge
cauldron (degh) to facilitate cooking for pilgrims.
He also had a mosque constructed within the
compound of the dargah.

Also part of ziyarat is the use of music and dance
including mystical chants performed by specially
trained musicians or qawwals to evoke divine
ecstasy. The sufis remember God either by reciting
the zikr (the Divine Names) or evoking His Presence
through sama‘ (literally, “audition”) or performance
of mystical music. Sama‘ was integral to the Chishtis,
and exemplified interaction with indigenous
devotional traditions.
What are the gestures that Jahanara
records to indicate her devotion to the Shaikh?
How does she suggest that the dargah was a
special place?

7.3  Languages and communication
It was not just in sama‘ that the Chishtis adopted
local languages. In Delhi, those associated with
the Chishti silsila conversed in Hindavi, the language
of the people. Other sufis such as Baba Farid
composed verses in the local language, which were
incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. Yet others
composed long poems or masnavis to express ideas
of divine love using human love as an allegory. For
example, the prem-akhyan (love story) Padmavat
composed by Malik Muhammad Jayasi revolved
around the romance of Padmini and Ratansen, the
king of Chittor. Their trials were symbolic of the soul’s
journey to the divine. Such poetic compositions were
often recited in hospices, usually during sama‘.
A different genre of sufi poetry was composed in
and around the town of Bijapur, Karnataka. These
were short poems in Dakhani (a variant of Urdu)
attributed to Chishti sufis who lived in this region
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
These poems were probably sung by women while
performing household chores like grinding grain and
spinning. Other compositions were in the form of
lurinama or lullabies and shadinama or wedding
songs. It is likely that the sufis of this region were
inspired by the pre-existing bhakti tradition of the
Kannada vachanas of the Lingayats and the Marathi
abhangs of the sants of Pandharpur. It is through
this medium that Islam gradually gained a place in
the villages of the Deccan.

7.4 Sufis and the state
A major feature of the Chishti tradition was austerity,
including maintaining a distance from worldly
power. However, this was by no means a situation of
absolute isolation from political power. The sufis
accepted unsolicited grants and donations from the
political elites. The Sultans in turn set up charitable
trusts (auqaf ) as endowments for hospices and
granted tax-free land (inam).
The Chishtis accepted donations in cash and kind.
Rather than accumulate donations, they preferred
to use these fully on immediate requirements
such as food, clothes, living quarters and ritual
necessities (such as sama‘ ). All this enhanced the
moral authority of the shaikhs, which in turn
attracted people from all walks of life. Further, their
piety and scholarship, and people’s belief in their
miraculous powers made sufis popular among the
masses, whose support kings wished to secure.
Kings did not simply need to demonstrate their
association with sufis; they also required legitimation
from them. When the Turks set up the Delhi
Sultanate, they resisted the insistence of the ulama
on imposing shari‘a as state law because they
anticipated opposition from their subjects, the
majority of whom were non-Muslims. The Sultans
then sought out the sufis – who derived their
authority directly from God – and did not depend on
jurists to interpret the shari‘a.
Besides, it was believed that the auliya could
intercede with God in order to improve the material
and spiritual conditions of ordinary human beings.
This explains why kings often wanted their tombs to
be in the vicinity of sufi shrines and hospices.
However, there were instances of conflict between
the Sultans and the sufis. To assert their authority,
both expected that certain rituals be performed such
as prostration and kissing of the feet. Occasionally
the sufi shaikh was addressed with high-sounding
titles. For example, the disciples of Nizamuddin
Auliya addressed him as sultan-ul-mashaikh (literally,
Sultan amongst shaikhs).

Many poet-saints engaged in explicit and implicit
dialogue with these new social situations, ideas and
institutions. Let us now see how this dialogue found
expression. We focus here on three of the most
influential figures of the time.
8.1 Weaving a divine fabric: Kabir
Kabir (c. fourteenth-fifteenth centuries) is perhaps
one of the most outstanding examples of a poet-saint
who emerged within this context. Historians have
painstakingly tried to reconstruct his life and times
through a study of compositions attributed to him
as well as later hagiographies. Such exercises have
proved to be challenging on a number of counts.
Verses ascribed to Kabir have been compiled in
three distinct but overlapping traditions. The Kabir
Bijak is preserved by the Kabirpanth (the path or
sect of Kabir) in Varanasi and elsewhere in Uttar
Pradesh; the Kabir Granthavali is associated with
the Dadupanth in Rajasthan, and many of his
compositions are found in the Adi Granth Sahib (see
Section 8.2). All these manuscript compilations
were made long after the death of Kabir. By the
nineteenth century, anthologies of verses attributed
to him circulated in print in regions as far apart as
Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
Kabir’s poems have survived in several languages
and dialects; and some are composed in the special
language of nirguna poets, the sant bhasha. Others,
known as ulatbansi (upside-down sayings), are
written in a form in which everyday meanings
are inverted. These hint at the difficulties of
capturing the nature of the Ultimate Reality in
words: expressions such as “the lotus which blooms
without flower” or the “fire raging in the ocean” convey
a sense of Kabir’s mystical experiences.
Also striking is the range of traditions Kabir drew
on to describe the Ultimate Reality. These include
Islam: he described the Ultimate Reality as Allah,
Khuda, Hazrat and Pir. He also used terms drawn
from Vedantic traditions, alakh (the unseen), nirakar
(formless), Brahman, Atman, etc. Other terms with
mystical connotations such as shabda (sound) or
shunya (emptiness) were drawn from yogic traditions.

Diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas are
expressed in these poems. Some poems draw on
Islamic ideas and use monotheism and iconoclasm
to attack Hindu polytheism and idol worship; others
use the sufi concept of zikr and ishq (love) to express
the Hindu practice of nam-simaran (remembrance
of God’s name).
Were all these composed by Kabir? We may never
be able to tell with certainty, although scholars have
tried to analyse the language, style and content to
establish which verses could be Kabir’s. What this
rich corpus of verses also signifies is that Kabir was
and is to the present a source of inspiration for
those who questioned entrenched religious and
social institutions, ideas and practices in their
search for the Divine.
Just as Kabir’s ideas probably
crystallised through dialogue
and debate (explicit or implicit)
with the traditions of sufis and
yogis in the region of Awadh (part
of present-day Uttar Pradesh),
his legacy was claimed by several
groups, who remembered him
and continue to do so.
This is most evident in later
debates about whether he was
a Hindu or a Muslim by birth,
debates that are reflected in
hagiographies. Many of these
composed
seventeenth century onwards,
about 200 years after Kabir’s
lifetime.
Hagiographies within the
Vaishnava tradition attempted
to suggest that he was born a
Hindu, Kabirdas (Kabir itself is
an Arabic word meaning “great”),
but was raised by a poor
Muslim family belonging to
the community of weavers or
julahas, who were relatively
recent converts to Islam. They
also suggested that he was
initiated into bhakti by a guru,
perhaps Ramananda.

It is likely that the compositions
of the sants were sung by
such musicians.
2015-16(20/01/2015)
However, the verses attributed to Kabir use the
words guru and satguru, but do not mention the name
of any specific preceptor. Historians have pointed
out that it is very difficult to establish that
Ramananda and Kabir were contemporaries, without
assigning improbably long lives to either or both.
So, while traditions linking the two cannot be
accepted at face value, they show how important
the legacy of Kabir was for later generations.
8.2 Baba Guru Nanak and the Sacred Word
Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) was born in a Hindu
merchant family in a village called Nankana Sahib
near the river Ravi in the predominantly Muslim
Punjab. He trained to be an accountant and studied
Persian. He was married at a young age but he spent
most of his time among sufis and bhaktas. He also
travelled widely.
The message of Baba Guru Nanak is spelt out in
his hymns and teachings. These suggest that he
advocated a form of nirguna bhakti. He firmly
repudiated the external practices of the religions he
saw around him. He rejected sacrifices, ritual baths,
image worship, austerities and the scriptures of both
Hindus and Muslims. For Baba Guru Nanak,
the Absolute or “rab” had no gender or form. He
proposed a simple way to connect to the Divine by
remembering and repeating the Divine Name,
expressing his ideas through hymns called “shabad”
in Punjabi, the language of the region. Baba Guru
Nanak would sing these compositions in various
ragas while his attendant Mardana played the rabab.
Baba Guru Nanak organised his followers into a
community. He set up rules for congregational
worship (sangat) involving collective recitation. He
appointed one of his disciples, Angad, to succeed
him as the preceptor (guru), and this practice was
followed for nearly 200 years.
It appears that Baba Guru Nanak did not
wish to establish a new religion, but after his death
his followers consolidated their own practices
and distinguished themselves from both Hindus
and Muslims. The fifth preceptor, Guru Arjan,
compiled Baba Guru Nanak’s hymns along with
those of his four successors and other religious
poets like Baba Farid, Ravidas (also known as
Raidas) and Kabir in the Adi Granth Sahib. These
hymns, called “gurbani”, are composed in various

languages. In the late seventeenth century the tenth
preceptor, Guru Gobind Singh, included the
compositions of the ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur,
and this scripture was called the Guru Granth Sahib.
Guru Gobind Singh also laid the foundation of the
Khalsa Panth (army of the pure) and defined its five
symbols: uncut hair, a dagger, a pair of shorts, a comb
and a steel bangle. Under him the community got
consolidated as a socio-religious and military force.
8.3 Mirabai, the devotee princess
Mirabai (c. fifteenth-sixteenth centuries) is perhaps
the best-known woman poet within the bhakti
tradition. Biographies have been reconstructed
primarily from the bhajans attributed to her, which
were transmitted orally for centuries. According to
these, she was a Rajput princess from Merta in
Marwar who was married against her wishes to a
prince of the Sisodia clan of Mewar, Rajasthan. She
defied her husband and did not submit to the
traditional role of wife and mother, instead
recognising Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, as her
lover. Her in-laws tried to poison her, but she escaped
from the palace to live as a wandering saint
composing songs that are characterised by intense
expressions of emotion.

attitude towards the king?

According to some traditions, her preceptor was
Raidas, a leather worker. This would indicate her
defiance of the norms of caste society. After
rejecting the comforts of her husband’s palace, she
is supposed to have donned the white robes of a
widow or the saffron robe of the renouncer.
Although Mirabai did not attract a sect or
group of followers, she has been recognised as a
source of inspiration for centuries. Her songs
continue to be sung by women and men, especially
those who are poor and considered “low caste” in
Gujarat and Rajasthan.

We have seen that historians draw on a variety
of sources to reconstruct histories of religious
traditions – these include sculpture, architecture,
stories  about religious preceptors, compositions
attributed to women and men engaged in the quest
of understanding the nature of the Divine.
As we have seen in Chapters 1 and 4, sculpture
and architecture can only be understood if we
have a grasp of the context – the ideas, beliefs and
practices of those who produced and used these
images and buildings. What about textual traditions
regarding religious beliefs? If you return to the
sources in this chapter, you will notice that they
include a wide variety, written in several different
languages and styles. They range from the
apparently simple, direct language of the vachanas
of Basavanna to the ornate Persian of the farman of
the Mughal emperors. Understanding each type of
text requires different skills: apart from a familiarity
with several languages, the historian has to be aware
of the subtle variations in style that characterise
each genre.

Virtually all these religious traditions continue to
flourish to date. This continuity has certain
advantages for historians as it allows them to compare
contemporary practices with those described in textual
traditions or shown in old paintings  and to trace
changes.  At the same time, because these traditions
are part of peoples’ lived beliefs and practices, there
is often a lack of acceptance of the possibility that
these may have changed over time.  The challenge for
historians is to undertake such investigations with
sensitivity, while at the same time recognising that
religious traditions, like other traditions, are dynamic
and change over time.

Vijayanagara or “city of victory” was the name of
both a city and an empire. The empire was founded
in the fourteenth century. In its heyday it stretched
from the river Krishna in the north to the extreme
south of the peninsula. In 1565 the city was sacked
and subsequently deserted. Although it fell into
ruin in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries, it
lived on in the memories of people living in the
Krishna-Tungabhadra doab. They remembered it
as Hampi, a name derived from that of the local
mother goddess, Pampadevi. These oral traditions
combined with archaeological finds, monuments
and inscriptions and other records helped scholars
to rediscover the Vijayanagara Empire.

The ruins at Hampi were brought to light in 1800 by
an engineer and antiquarian named Colonel Colin
Mackenzie. An employee of the English East India
Company, he prepared the first survey map of the
site. Much of the initial information he received was
based on the memories of priests of the Virupaksha
temple and the shrine of Pampadevi. Subsequently,
from 1856, photographers began to record the
monuments which enabled scholars to study them.
As early as 1836 epigraphists began collecting
several dozen inscriptions found at this and other
temples at Hampi. In an effort to reconstruct the
history of the city and the empire, historians collated
information from these sources with accounts of
foreign travellers and other literature written in
Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit.

According to tradition and epigraphic evidence two
brothers, Harihara and Bukka, founded the
Vijayanagara Empire in 1336. This empire included
within its fluctuating frontiers peoples who spoke
different languages and followed different religious
traditions.
On their northern frontier, the Vijayanagara kings
competed with contemporary rulers – including the
Sultans of the Deccan and the Gajapati rulers of
Orissa – for control of the fertile river valleys and
the resources generated by lucrative overseas trade.
At the same time, interaction between these states
led to sharing of ideas, especially in the field of
architecture. The rulers of Vijayanagara borrowed
concepts and building techniques which they then
developed further.

Some of the areas that were incorporated within
the empire had witnessed the development of
powerful states such as those of the Cholas in Tamil
Nadu and the Hoysalas in Karnataka. Ruling elites
in these areas had extended patronage to elaborate
temples such as the Brihadishvara temple at
Thanjavur and the Chennakeshava temple at Belur.
The rulers of Vijayanagara, who called themselves
rayas, built on these traditions and carried them,
as we will see, literally to new heights.
2.1 Kings and traders
As warfare during these times depended upon
effective cavalry, the import of horses from Arabia
and Central Asia was very important for rival
kingdoms. This trade was initially controlled by Arab
traders. Local communities of merchants known as
kudirai chettis or horse merchants also participated
in these exchanges. From 1498 other actors appeared
on the scene. These were the Portuguese, who arrived
on the west coast of the subcontinent and attempted
to establish trading and military stations. Their
superior military technology, especially the use of
muskets, enabled them to become important players
in the tangled politics of the period.
In fact, Vijayanagara was also noted for its
markets dealing in spices, textiles and precious
stones. Trade was often regarded as a status symbol
for such cities, which boasted of a wealthy population
that demanded high-value exotic goods, especially
precious stones and jewellery. The revenue derived

2.2 The apogee and decline of the empire
Within the polity, claimants to power included
members of the ruling lineage as well as military
commanders. The first dynasty, known as the
Sangama dynasty, exercised control till 1485.
They were supplanted by the Saluvas, military
commanders, who remained in power till 1503
when they were replaced by the Tuluvas.
Krishnadeva Raya belonged to the Tuluva dynasty.
Krishnadeva Raya’s rule was characterised by
expansion and consolidation. This was the time
when the land between the Tungabhadra and
Krishna rivers (the Raichur doab) was acquired
(1512), the rulers of Orissa were subdued (1514) and
severe defeats were inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur
(1520). Although the kingdom remained in a constant
state of military preparedness, it flourished under
conditions of unparalleled peace and prosperity.
Krishnadeva Raya is credited with building some
fine temples and adding impressive gopurams to
many important south Indian temples. He also
founded a suburban township near Vijayanagara
called Nagalapuram after his mother. Some of the
most detailed descriptions of Vijayanagara come from
his time or just after.
Strain began to show within the imperial structure
following Krishnadeva Raya’s death in 1529. His
successors were troubled by rebellious nayakas or
military chiefs. By 1542 control at the centre had
shifted to another ruling lineage, that of the Aravidu,
which remained in power till the end of the
seventeenth century. During this period, as indeed
earlier, the military ambitions of the rulers
of Vijayanagara as well as those of the Deccan
Sultanates resulted in shifting alignments.
Eventually this led to an alliance of the Sultanates
against Vijayanagara. In 1565 Rama Raya, the chief
minister of Vijayanagara, led the army into battle
at Rakshasi-Tangadi (also known as Talikota), where
his forces were routed by the combined armies
of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar and Golconda. The victorious
armies sacked the city of Vijayanagara. The city was
totally abandoned within a few years. Now the focus
of the empire shifted to the east where the Aravidu

dynasty ruled from Penukonda and later from
Chandragiri (near Tirupati).
Although the armies of the Sultans were responsible
for the destruction of the city of Vijayanagara, relations
between the Sultans and the rayas were not always
or inevitably hostile, in spite of religious differences.
Krishnadeva Raya, for example, supported some
claimants to power in the Sultanates and took pride
in the title “establisher of the Yavana kingdom”.
Similarly, the Sultan of Bijapur intervened to resolve
succession disputes in Vijayanagara following the
death of Krishnadeva Raya. In fact the Vijayanagara
kings were keen to ensure the stability of the
Sultanates and vice versa. It was the adventurous
policy of Rama Raya who tried to play off one Sultan
against another that led the Sultans to combine
together and decisively defeat him.

2.3 The rayas and the nayakas
Among those who exercised power in the empire were
military chiefs who usually controlled forts and had
armed supporters. These chiefs often moved from
one area to another, and in many cases were
accompanied by peasants looking for fertile land on
which to settle. These chiefs were known as nayakas
and they usually spoke Telugu or Kannada. Many
nayakas submitted to the authority of the kings of
Vijayanagara but they often rebelled and had to be
subdued by military action.
The amara-nayaka system was a major political
innovation of the Vijayanagara Empire. It is likely
that many features of this system were derived from
the iqta system of the Delhi Sultanate.
The amara-nayakas were military commanders
who were given territories to govern by the raya.
They collected taxes and other dues from peasants,
craftspersons and traders in the area. They retained
part of the revenue for personal use and for
maintaining a stipulated contingent of horses
and elephants. These contingents provided the
Vijayanagara kings with an effective fighting force
with which they brought the entire southern
peninsula under their control. Some of the revenue
was also used for the maintenance of temples and
irrigation works.
The amara-nayakas sent tribute to the king
annually and personally appeared in the royal court
with gifts to express their loyalty. Kings occasionally
asserted their control over them by transferring them
from one place to another. However, during the course
of the seventeenth century, many of these nayakas
established independent kingdoms. This hastened
the collapse of the central imperial structure.

3.1 Water resources
The most striking feature about the location of
Vijayanagara is the natural basin formed by the
river Tungabhadra which flows in a north-easterly
direction. The surrounding landscape is characterised
by stunning granite hills that seem to form a girdle
around the city. A number of streams flow down to
the river from these rocky outcrops.
In almost all cases embankments were built along
these streams to create reservoirs of varying sizes.
As this is one of the most arid zones of the peninsula,
elaborate arrangements had to be made to store
rainwater and conduct it to the city. The most
important such tank was built in the early years
of the fifteenth century and is now called
Kamalapuram tank. Water from this tank not only
irrigated fields nearby but was also conducted
through a channel to the “royal centre”.
One of the most prominent waterworks to be seen
among the ruins is the Hiriya canal. This canal drew
water from a dam across the Tungabhadra and
irrigated the cultivated valley that separated the
“sacred centre” from the “urban core”. This was
apparently built by kings of the Sangama dynasty.
3.2 Fortifications and roads
Before we examine the different parts of the city in
detail let us look at what enclosed them all – the
great fortress walls. Abdur Razzaq, an ambassador
sent by the ruler of Persia to Calicut (present-day
Kozhikode) in the fifteenth century, was greatly
impressed by the fortifications, and mentioned
seven lines of forts. These encircled not only the
city but also its agricultural hinterland and forests.
The outermost wall linked the hills surrounding
the city. The massive masonry construction was
slightly tapered.  No mortar or cementing agent was
employed anywhere in the construction. The stone
blocks were wedge shaped, which held them in
place, and the inner portion of the walls was of
earth packed with rubble. Square or rectangular
bastions projected outwards.
What was most significant about this fortification
is that it enclosed agricultural tracts. Abdur Razzaq
noted that “ between the first, second and the third
walls there are cultivated fields, gardens and houses”.
And Paes observed: “From this first circuit until you

enter the city there is a great distance, in which are
fields in which they sow rice and have many gardens
and much water, in which water comes from two
lakes.” These statements have been corroborated by
present-day archaeologists, who have also found
evidence of an agricultural tract between the sacred
centre and the urban core. This tract was serviced
by an elaborate canal system drawing water from
the Tungabhadra.
Why do you think agricultural tracts were
incorporated within the fortified area? Often, the
objective of medieval sieges was to starve the
defenders into submission. These sieges could last
for several months and sometimes even years.
Normally rulers tried to be prepared for such
situations by building large granaries within
fortified areas. The rulers of Vijayanagara adopted
a more expensive and elaborate strategy of protecting
the agricultural belt itself.
A second line of fortification went round the
inner core of the urban complex, and a third line
surrounded the royal centre, within which each set
of major buildings was surrounded by its own
high walls.
The fort was entered through well-guarded gates,
which linked the city to the major roads. Gateways
were distinctive architectural features that often
defined the structures to which they regulated
access. The arch on the gateway leading into the
fortified settlement as well as the dome over the
gate (Fig. 7.6) are regarded as typical features of the
architecture introduced by the Turkish Sultans. Art
historians refer to this style as Indo-Islamic, as it
grew continually through interaction with local
building practices in different regions.
Archaeologists have studied roads within the city
and those leading out from it. These have been
identified by tracing paths through gateways, as well
as by finds of pavements. Roads generally wound
around through the valleys, avoiding rocky terrain.
Some of the most important roads extended from
temple gateways, and were lined by bazaars.
3.3 The urban core
Moving along the roads leading into the urban core,
there is relatively little archaeological evidence of
the houses of ordinary people. Archaeologists have

found fine Chinese porcelain in some areas,
including in the north-eastern corner of the urban
core and suggest that these areas may have been
occupied by rich traders. This was also the Muslim
residential quarter. Tombs and mosques located
here have distinctive functions, yet their architecture
resembles that of the mandapas found in the temples
of Hampi.
This is how the sixteenth-century Portuguese
traveller Barbosa described the houses of ordinary
people, which have not survived: “The other houses
of the people are thatched, but nonetheless well built
and arranged according to occupations, in long
streets with many open places.”
Field surveys indicate that the entire area was
dotted with numerous shrines and small temples,
pointing to the prevalence of a variety of cults,
perhaps supported by different communities. The
surveys also indicate that wells, rainwater tanks as
well as temple tanks may have served as sources of
water to the ordinary town dwellers.

The royal centre was located in the south-western
part of the settlement. Although designated as a royal
centre, it included over 60 temples. Clearly, the
patronage of temples and cults was important for
rulers who were trying to establish and legitimise
their authority through association with the
divinities housed in the shrines.
About thirty building complexes have been
identified as palaces. These are relatively large
structures that do not seem to have been associated

with ritual functions. One difference between
these structures and temples is that the latter
were constructed entirely of masonry, while the
superstructure of the secular buildings was made
of perishable materials.
4.1 The mahanavami dibba
Some of the more distinctive structures in the area
have been assigned names based on the form of
the buildings as well as their functions. The “king’s
palace” is the largest of the enclosures but has not
yielded definitive evidence of being a royal residence.
It has two of the most impressive platforms, usually
called the “audience hall” and the “mahanavami
dibba”. The entire complex is surrounded by high
double walls with a street running between them.
The audience hall is a high platform with slots for
wooden pillars at close and regular intervals. It had
a staircase going up to the second floor, which rested
on these pillars. The pillars being closely spaced,
would have left little free space and thus it is not
clear what the hall was used for.
Located on one of the highest points in the city,
the “mahanavami dibba” is a massive platform rising
from a base of about 11,000 sq. ft to a height of
40 ft. There is evidence that it supported a wooden
structure. The base of the platform is covered with
relief carvings (Fig. 7.12).
Rituals associated with the structure probably
coincided with Mahanavami (literally, the great ninth
day) of the ten-day Hindu festival during the autumn
months of September and October, known variously
as Dusehra (northern India), Durga Puja (in Bengal)

and Navaratri or Mahanavami (in peninsular India).
The Vijayanagara kings displayed their prestige, power
and suzerainty on this occasion.
The ceremonies performed on the occasion included
worship of the image, worship of the state horse, and
the sacrifice of buffaloes and other animals. Dances,
wrestling matches, and processions of caparisoned
horses, elephants and chariots and soldiers, as well
as ritual presentations before the king and his
guests by the chief nayakas and subordinate kings
marked the occasion. These ceremonies were imbued
with deep symbolic meanings. On the last day of the
festival the king inspected his army and the armies
of the nayakas in a grand ceremony in an open field.
On this occasion the nayakas brought rich gifts for
the king as well as the stipulated tribute.
Was the “mahanavami dibba” that stands today
the centre of this elaborate ritual? Scholars have
pointed out that the space surrounding the structure
does not seem to have been adequate for elaborate
processions of armed men, women, and large
numbers of animals. Like some of the other
structures in the royal centre, it remains an enigma.
4.2 Other buildings in the royal centre
One of the most beautiful buildings in the royal
centre is the Lotus Mahal, so named by British
travellers in the nineteenth century. While the name
is certainly romantic, historians are not quite sure

what the building was used for. One suggestion,
found in a map drawn by Mackenzie, is that it
may have been a council chamber, a place where
the king met his advisers.
While most temples were located in the sacred
centre, there were several in the royal centre as well.

One of the most spectacular of these is one known as
the Hazara Rama temple. This was probably meant
to be used only by the king and his family. The images
in the central shrine are missing; however, sculpted
panels on the walls survive. These include scenes
from the Ramayana sculpted on the inner walls of
the shrine.
While many of the structures at Vijayanagara
were destroyed when the city was sacked, traditions
of building palatial structures were continued by
the nayakas. Many of these buildings have survived.

5.1 Choosing a capital
We now move to the rocky northern end of the city
on the banks of the Tungabhadra. According to local
tradition, these hills sheltered the monkey kingdom
of Vali and Sugriva mentioned in the Ramayana.
Other traditions suggest that Pampadevi, the local
mother goddess, did penance in these hills in order
to marry Virupaksha, the guardian deity of the
kingdom, also recognised as a form of Shiva. To this
day this marriage is celebrated annually in the
Virupaksha temple. Among these hills are found
Jaina temples of the pre-Vijayanagara period as well.
In other words, this area was associated with several
sacred traditions.
Temple building in the region had a long history,
going back to dynasties such as the Pallavas,
Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Cholas. Rulers very often
encouraged temple building as a means of
associating themselves with the divine – often, the
deity was explicitly or implicitly identified with the
king. Temples also functioned as centres of learning.
Besides, rulers and others often granted land and
other resources for the maintenance of temples.
Consequently, temples developed as significant
religious, social, cultural and economic centres. From
the point of view of the rulers, constructing, repairing
and maintaining temples were important means
of winning support and recognition for their power,
wealth and piety.
It is likely that the very choice of the site of
Vijayanagara was inspired by the existence of the
shrines of Virupaksha and Pampadevi. In fact the
Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of
the god Virupaksha. All royal orders were signed
“Shri Virupaksha”, usually in the Kannada script.
Rulers also indicated their close links with the gods
by using the title “Hindu Suratrana”. This was a
Sanskritisation of the Arabic term Sultan, meaning
king, so it literally meant Hindu Sultan.
Even as they drew on earlier traditions, the rulers
of Vijayanagara innovated and developed these.
Royal portrait sculpture was now displayed in
temples, and the king’s visits to temples were treated
as important state occasions on which he was
accompanied by the important nayakas of the empire.

5.2. Gopurams and mandapas
In terms of temple architecture, by this period
certain new features were in evidence. These
included structures of immense scale that must have
been a mark of imperial authority, best exemplified
by the raya gopurams (Fig. 7.7) or royal gateways
that often dwarfed the towers on the central shrines,
and signalled the presence of the temple from a great

distance. They were also probably meant as
reminders of the power of kings, able to command
the resources, techniques and skills needed to
construct these towering gateways. Other distinctive
features include mandapas or pavilions and
long, pillared corridors that often ran around the
shrines within the temple complex. Let us look at
two temples more closely – the Virupaksha temple
and the Vitthala temple.
The Virupaksha temple was built over centuries.
While inscriptions suggest that the earliest
shrine dated to the ninth-tenth centuries, it was
substantially enlarged with the establishment
of the Vijayanagara Empire. The hall in front of
the main shrine was built by Krishnadeva Raya to
mark his accession. This was decorated with
delicately carved pillars. He is also credited with

the construction of the eastern gopuram. These
additions meant that the central shrine came to
occupy a relatively small part of the complex.
The halls in the temple were used for a variety of
purposes. Some were spaces in which the images of
gods were placed to witness special programmes of
music, dance, drama, etc. Others were used to
celebrate the marriages of deities, and yet others
were meant for the deities to swing in. Special images,
distinct from those kept in the small central shrine,
were used on these occasions.

Another shrine, the Vitthala temple, is also
interesting. Here, the principal deity was Vitthala, a
form of Vishnu generally worshipped in Maharashtra.
The introduction of the worship of the deity in
Karnataka is another indication of the ways in which
the rulers of Vijayanagara drew on different traditions
to create an imperial culture. As in the case of other
temples, this temple too has several halls and a
unique shrine designed as a chariot (Fig. 7.24).
A characteristic feature of the temple complexes
is the chariot streets that extended from the temple
gopuram in a straight line. These streets were paved
with stone slabs and lined with pillared pavilions in
which merchants set up their shops.
Just as the nayakas continued with and elaborated
on traditions of fortification, so they did with
traditions of temple building. In fact, some of the
most spectacular gopurams were also built by the
local nayakas.

How and why did the rulers of Vijayanagara adopt
and adapt earlier traditions of ritual architecture?

We have been examining a wealth of information on
Vijayanagara – photographs, plans, elevations of
structures and sculpture. How was all of this
produced? After the initial surveys by Mackenzie,
information was pieced together from travellers’
accounts and inscriptions. Through the twentieth
century, the site was preserved by the Archaeological
Survey of India and the Karnataka Department of
Archaeology and Museums. In 1976, Hampi was
recognised as a site of national importance. Then,
in the early 1980s, an important project was
launched to document the material remains at
Vijayanagara in detail, through extensive and
intensive surveys, using a variety of recording
techniques. Over nearly twenty years, dozens of

scholars from all over the
world worked to compile and
preserve this information.
Let us look at just one
part of this enormous
exercise – mapping – in
more detail. The first step
was to divide the entire
area into a set of 25
squares, each designated by
a letter of the alphabet. Then,
each of the small squares
was subdivided into a set
of even smaller squares. But
this was not all: each of
these smaller squares was
further subdivided into yet
smaller units.
As you can see, these
detailed
surveys
been extremely painstaking,
and have recovered and
documented
traces
thousands of structures –
from tiny shrines and
residences to elaborate
temples. They have also led
to the recovery of traces of
roads, paths, bazaars, etc.

The latter have been located
through finds of pillar bases
and platforms – all that remain
of thriving markets.
It is worth remembering
something that John M. Fritz,
George Michell and M.S. Nagaraja
Rao, who worked for years at the
site, wrote: “In our study of these
monuments of Vijayanagara we
have to imagine a whole series
of vanished wooden elements –
columns,
brackets,
beams,
ceilings, overhanging eaves, and
towers – decorated with plaster
and painted, perhaps brightly.”
Although wooden structures are
lost, and only stone structures
survive, the descriptions left by
travellers allow us to reconstruct
some aspects of the vibrant life of
the times.

Buildings that survive tell us about the way spaces
were organised and used, how they were built, with
what materials and techniques. For example, we
can assess the defence requirements and military
preparedness of a city by studying its fortifications.
Buildings also tell us about the spread of ideas and
cultural influences if we compare them with
buildings in other places. They convey ideas which
the builders or their patrons wished to project. They
are often suffused with symbols which are a product
of their cultural context. These we can understand
when we combine information from other sources
like literature, inscriptions and popular traditions.

Investigations of architectural features do not
tell us what ordinary men, women and children,
comprising the vast majority of the people who lived
in the city and its outskirts, thought about these
impressive buildings. Would they have had access
to any of the areas within the royal centre or the
sacred centre? Would they hurry past the sculpture,
or would they pause to see, reflect and try and
understand its complicated symbolism? And what
did the people who worked on these colossal
construction projects think of the enterprises to
which they had contributed their labour?
While rulers took all important decisions about the
buildings to be constructed, the site, the material to
be used and the style to be followed, who possessed
the specialised knowledge required for such
enormous enterprises? Who drew up the plans for
the buildings? Where did the masons, stonecutters,
sculptors who did the actual building come from?
Were they captured during war from neighbouring
regions? What kind of wages did they get? Who
supervised the building activity? How was building
material transported and where did it come from?
These are some of the questions that we cannot
answer by merely looking at the buildings or their
remains. Continuing research using other sources
might provide some further clues.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
about 85 per cent of the population of India lived in
its villages. Both peasants and landed elites were
involved in agricultural production and claimed
rights to a share of the produce. This created
relationships of cooperation, competition and
conflict among them. The sum of these agrarian
relationships made up rural society.
At the same time agencies from outside also
entered into the rural world. Most important among
these was the Mughal state, which derived the
bulk of its income from agricultural production.
Agents of the state – revenue assessors, collectors,
record keepers – sought to control rural society so
as to ensure that cultivation took place and the
state got its regular share of taxes from the
produce. Since many crops were grown for sale,
trade, money and markets entered the villages and
linked the agricultural areas with the towns.

The basic unit of agricultural society was the village,
inhabited by peasants who performed the manifold
seasonal tasks that made up agricultural production
throughout the year – tilling the soil, sowing seeds,
harvesting the crop when it was ripe. Further, they
contributed their labour to the production of
agro-based goods such as sugar and oil.
But rural India was not characterised by settled
peasant production alone. Several kinds of areas
such as large tracts of dry land or hilly regions were
not cultivable in the same way as the more fertile

expanses of land. In addition, forest areas made up
a substantial proportion of territory. We need to keep
this varied topography in mind when discussing
agrarian society.
1.1 Looking for sources
Our understanding of the workings of rural society does
not come from those who worked the land, as peasants
did not write about themselves. Our major source for
the agrarian history of the sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries are chronicles and documents
from the Mughal court (see also Chapter 9).
One of the most important chronicles was the
Ain-i Akbari (in short the Ain, see also Section 8)
authored by Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl. This
text meticulously recorded the arrangements made
by the state to ensure cultivation, to enable the
collection of revenue by the agencies of the state
and to regulate the relationship between the state
and rural magnates, the zamindars.
The central purpose of the Ain was to present a
vision of Akbar’s empire where social harmony was
provided by a strong ruling class. Any revolt or assertion
of autonomous power against the Mughal state was,
in the eyes of the author of the Ain, predestined to fail.
In other words, whatever we learn from the Ain about
peasants remains a view from the top.
Fortunately, however, the account of the Ain can
be supplemented by descriptions contained in sources
emanating from regions away from the Mughal
capital. These include detailed revenue records from
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan dating from
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Further,
the extensive records of the East India Company (see
also Chapter 10) provide us with useful descriptions
of agrarian relations in eastern India. All these
sources record instances of conflicts between
peasants, zamindars and the state. In the process
they give us an insight into peasants’ perception of
and their expectations of fairness from the state.
1.2 Peasants and their lands
The term which Indo-Persian sources of the Mughal
period most frequently used to denote a peasant was
raiyat (plural, riaya) or muzarian. In addition, we
also encounter the terms kisan or asami. Sources of
the seventeenth century refer to two kinds of
peasants – khud-kashta and pahi-kashta. The former

2015-16(20/01/2015)

were residents of the village in which they held their
lands. The latter were non-resident cultivators who
belonged to some other village, but cultivated lands
elsewhere on a contractual basis. People became
pahi-kashta either out of choice – for example, when
terms of revenue in a distant village were more
favourable – or out of compulsion – for example,
forced by economic distress after a famine.
Seldom did the average peasant of north India
possess more than a pair of bullocks and two
ploughs; most possessed even less. In Gujarat
peasants possessing about six acres of land were
considered to be affluent; in Bengal, on the other
hand, five acres was the upper limit of an average
peasant farm ; 10 acres would make one a rich asami.
Cultivation was based on the principle of individual
ownership. Peasant lands were bought and sold in
the same way as the lands of other property owners.
This nineteenth-century description of peasant
holdings in the Delhi-Agra region would apply equally
to the seventeenth century:
The cultivating peasants (asamis), who plough
up the fields, mark the limits of each field, for
identification and demarcation, with borders of
(raised) earth, brick and thorn so that thousands
of such fields may be counted in a village.
1.3 Irrigation and technology
The abundance of land, available labour and the
mobility of peasants were three factors that
accounted for the constant expansion of agriculture.
Since the primary purpose of agriculture is to feed
people, basic staples such as rice, wheat or millets
were the most frequently cultivated crops. Areas
which received 40 inches or more of rainfall a year
were generally rice-producing zones, followed by
wheat and millets, corresponding to a descending
scale of precipitation.
Monsoons remained the backbone of Indian
agriculture, as they are even today. But there were
crops which required additional water. Artificial
systems of irrigation had to be devised for this.

Irrigation projects received state support as well.
For example, in northern India the state undertook
digging of new canals (nahr, nala) and also repaired
old ones like the shahnahr in the Punjab during Shah
Jahan’s reign.
Though agriculture was labour intensive, peasants
did use technologies that often harnessed cattle
energy. One example was the wooden plough, which
was light and easily assembled with an iron tip or
coulter. It therefore did not make deep furrows, which
preserved the moisture better during the intensely
hot months. A drill, pulled by a pair of giant oxen,
was used to plant seeds, but broadcasting of
seed was the most prevalent method. Hoeing and
weeding were done simultaneously using a narrow
iron blade with a small wooden handle.
1.4 An abundance of crops
Agriculture was organised around two major
seasonal cycles, the kharif (autumn) and the rabi
(spring). This would mean that most regions,  except
those terrains that were the most arid or
inhospitable, produced a minimum of two crops a
year (do-fasla), whereas some, where rainfall or
irrigation assured a continuous supply of water, even
gave three crops. This ensured an enormous variety
of produce. For instance, we are told in the Ain that
the Mughal provinces of Agra produced 39 varieties
of crops and Delhi produced 43 over the two seasons.
Bengal produced 50 varieties of rice alone.
However, the focus on the cultivation of basic
staples did not mean that agriculture in medieval
India was only for subsistence. We often come across
the term jins-i kamil (literally, perfect crops) in our
sources. The Mughal state also encouraged peasants
to cultivate such crops as they brought in more
revenue. Crops such as cotton and sugarcane were
jins-i kamil par excellence. Cotton was grown over a
great swathe of territory spread over central India
and the Deccan plateau, whereas Bengal was famous
for its sugar. Such cash crops would also include
various sorts of oilseeds (for example, mustard) and
lentils. This shows how subsistence and commercial
production were closely intertwined in an average
peasant’s holding.
During the seventeenth century several new crops
from different parts of the world reached the Indian

subcontinent. Maize (makka), for example, was
introduced into India via Africa and Spain and by
the seventeenth century it was being listed as one

tomatoes, potatoes and chillies were introduced from
the New World at this time, as were fruits like the
pineapple and the papaya.

The above account makes it clear that agricultural
production involved the intensive participation and
initiative of the peasantry. How did this affect the
structure of agrarian relations in Mughal society?
To find out, let us look at the social groups involved
in agricultural expansion, and at their relationships
and conflicts.
We have seen that peasants held their lands in
individual ownership. At the same time they belonged
to a collective village community as far as many
aspects of their social existence were concerned.
There were three constituents of this community –
the cultivators, the panchayat, and the village
headman (muqaddam or mandal).
2.1 Caste and the rural milieu
Deep inequities on the basis of caste and other caste-
like distinctions meant that the cultivators were a
highly heterogeneous group. Among those who tilled
the land, there was a sizeable number who worked
as menials or agricultural
labourers (majur).
Despite the abundance of
cultivable land, certain caste
groups were assigned menial
tasks and thus relegated to
poverty. Though there was
no census at  that  time, the
little data that we have
suggest that such groups
comprised a large section of
the village population, had
the least resources and were
constrained by their position
in the caste hierarchy, much
like the Dalits of modern
India. Such distinctions had
begun permeating into other

communities too. In Muslim communities menials like
the halalkhoran (scavengers) were housed outside the
boundaries of the village; similarly the mallahzadas
(literally, sons of boatmen) in Bihar were comparable
to slaves.
There was a direct correlation between caste,
poverty and social status at the lower strata of
society. Such correlations were not so marked at
intermediate levels. In a manual from seventeenth-
century Marwar, Rajputs are mentioned as peasants,
sharing the same space with Jats, who were accorded
a lower status in the caste hierarchy. The Gauravas,
who cultivated land around Vrindavan (Uttar
Pradesh), sought Rajput status in the seventeenth
century. Castes such as the Ahirs, Gujars and Malis
rose in the hierarchy because of the profitability of
cattle rearing and horticulture. In the eastern
regions, intermediate pastoral and fishing castes
like the Sadgops and Kaivartas acquired the status
of peasants.
2.2 Panchayats and headmen
The village panchayat was an assembly of elders,
usually important people of the village with hereditary
rights over their property. In mixed-caste villages,
the panchayat was usually a heterogeneous body. An
oligarchy, the panchayat represented various castes
and communities in the village, though the village
menial-cum-agricultural worker was unlikely to be
represented there. The decisions made by these
panchayats were binding on the members.
The panchayat was headed by a headman known
as muqaddam or mandal. Some sources suggest that
the headman was chosen through the consensus of
the village elders, and that this choice had to be
ratified by the zamindar. Headmen held office as long
as they enjoyed the confidence of the village elders,
failing which they could be dismissed by them. The
chief function of the headman was to supervise the
preparation of village accounts, assisted by the
accountant or patwari of the panchayat.

natural calamities (like
floods), were also met from
these funds. Often these
funds were also deployed in
construction of a bund or
digging
canal
which
peasants usually could not
afford to do on their own.
One important function of
the panchayat was to ensure
that caste boundaries among
the various communities
inhabiting the village were
upheld. In eastern India all
marriages were held in the
presence of the mandal. In other words one of the
duties of the village headman was to oversee the
conduct of the members of the village community
“chiefly to prevent any offence against their caste”.
Panchayats also had the authority to levy fines
and inflict more serious forms of punishment like
expulsion from the community. The latter was a
drastic step and was in most cases meted out for a
limited period. It meant that a person forced to leave
the village became an outcaste and lost his right
to practise his profession. Such a measure was
intended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms.
In addition to the village panchayat each caste
or jati in the village had its own jati panchayat.
These panchayats wielded considerable power
in rural society. In Rajasthan jati panchayats
arbitrated civil disputes between members of
different castes. They mediated in contested claims
on land, decided whether marriages were performed
according to the norms laid down by a particular
caste group, determined who had ritual precedence
in village functions, and so on. In most cases,
except in matters of criminal justice, the state
respected the decisions of jati panchayats.
Archival records from western India – notably
Rajasthan and Maharashtra – contain petitions
presented to the panchayat complaining about
extortionate taxation or the demand for unpaid
labour (begar) imposed by the “superior” castes or
officials of the state. These petitions were usually
made by villagers, from the lowest rungs of rural
society. Often petitions were made collectively as

well, by a caste group or a community protesting
against what they considered were morally
illegitimate demands on the part of elite groups.
These included excessive tax demands which,
especially in times of drought or other disasters,
endangered the peasants’ subsistence. In the eyes
of the petitioners the right to the basic minimum for
survival was sanctioned by custom. They regarded
the village panchayat as the court of appeal that
would ensure that the state carried out its moral
obligations and guaranteed justice.
The decision of the panchayat in
conflicts between “lower-caste”
peasants and state officials or the
local zamindar could vary from
case to case. In cases of excessive
revenue demands, the panchayat
often suggested compromise. In
cases where reconciliation failed,
peasants took recourse to more
drastic forms of resistance, such as
deserting the village. The relatively
easy availability of uncultivated land
and the competition over labour
resources made this an effective
weapon in the hands of cultivators.
2.3 Village artisans
Another interesting aspect of
the village was the elaborate
relationship of exchange between
different
producers.
Marathi
documents and village surveys
made in the early years of British
rule have revealed the existence of
substantial numbers of artisans,
sometimes as high as 25 per cent of
the total households in the villages.
At times, however, the distinction
between artisans and peasants in
village society was a fluid one, as
many groups performed the tasks
of both. Cultivators and their
families would also participate in
craft production – such as dyeing,
textile printing, baking and firing
of pottery, making and repairing
Fig. 8.5

depicting textile production
Describe the activities that

agricultural implements. Phases in the agricultural
calendar when there was a relative lull in activity,
as between sowing and weeding or between weeding
and harvesting, were a time when cultivators could
engage in artisanal production.
Village artisans – potters, blacksmiths, carpenters,
barbers, even goldsmiths – provided specialised
services in return for which they were compensated
by villagers by a variety of means. The most common
way of doing so was by giving them a share of the
harvest, or an allotment of land, perhaps cultivable
wastes, which was likely to be decided by the
panchayat. In Maharashtra such lands became the
artisans’ miras or watan – their hereditary holding.
Another variant of this was a system where
artisans and individual peasant households entered
into a mutually negotiated system of remuneration,
most of the time goods for services. For example,
eighteenth-century records tell us of zamindars in
Bengal who remunerated blacksmiths, carpenters,
even goldsmiths for their work by paying them “a
small daily allowance and diet money”. This later
came to be described as the jajmani system,
though the term was not in vogue in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Such evidence is
interesting because it indicates the intricate ways
in which exchange networks operated at the
micro-level of the village. Cash remuneration was
not entirely unknown either.
2.4  A “little republic”?
How does one understand the significance of the
village community? Some British officials in the
nineteenth century saw the village as a “little
republic” made up of fraternal partners sharing
resources and labour in a collective. However, this
was not a sign of rural egalitarianism. There was
individual ownership of assets and deep inequities
based on caste and gender distinctions. A group
of powerful individuals decided the affairs of the
village, exploited the weaker sections and had the
authority to dispense justice.
More importantly, a cash nexus had already
developed through trade between villages and towns.
In the Mughal heartland too, revenue was assessed
and collected in cash. Artisans producing for the
export market (for example, weavers) received their

advances or wages in cash, as did producers of

described in this section were similar to or
different from present-day gram panchayats?

As you may have observed in many different societies,
the production process often involves men and
women performing certain specified roles. In the
contexts that we are exploring, women and men had
to work shoulder to shoulder in the fields. Men
tilled and ploughed, while women sowed, weeded,
threshed and winnowed the harvest. With the growth
of nucleated villages and expansion in individuated
peasant farming, which characterised medieval
Indian agriculture, the basis of production was the
labour and resources of the entire household.
Naturally, a gendered segregation between the home
(for women) and the world (for men) was not possible
in this context. Nonetheless biases related to women’s
biological functions did continue. Menstruating
women, for instance, were not allowed to touch the
plough or the potter’s wheel in western India, or
enter the groves where betel-leaves (paan) were
grown in Bengal.
Artisanal tasks such as spinning yarn, sifting and
kneading clay for pottery, and embroidery were among
the many aspects of production dependent on female
labour. The more commercialised the product, the
greater the demand on women’s labour to produce it.
In fact, peasant and artisan women worked not only
in the fields, but even went to the houses of their
employers or to the markets if necessary.
Women were considered an important resource in
agrarian society also because they were child bearers
in a society dependent on labour. At the same time,
high mortality rates among women – owing to
malnutrition, frequent pregnancies, death during
childbirth – often meant a shortage of wives. This
led to the emergence of social customs in peasant
and artisan communities that were distinct from

those prevalent among elite groups. Marriages in
many rural communities required the payment of
bride-price rather than dowry to the bride’s family.
Remarriage was considered legitimate both among
divorced and widowed women.
The importance attached to women as a
reproductive force also meant that the fear of losing
control over them was great. According to established
social norms, the household was headed by a male.
Thus women were kept under strict control by the
male members of the family and the community.
They could inflict draconian punishments if they
suspected infidelity on the part of women.
Documents from Western India – Rajasthan, Gujarat
and Maharashtra – record petitions sent by women to
the village panchayat, seeking redress and justice.
Wives protested against the infidelity of their
husbands or the neglect of the wife and children by
the male head of the household, the grihasthi. While
male infidelity was not always punished, the state
and “superior” caste groups did intervene when it came
to ensuring that the family was adequately provided
for. In most cases when women petitioned to the
panchayat, their names were excluded from the

Amongst the landed gentry, women had the right
to inherit property. Instances from the Punjab show
that women, including widows, actively participated
in the rural land market as sellers of property inherited
by them. Hindu and Muslim women inherited
zamindaris which they were free to sell or mortgage.
Women zamindars were known in eighteenth-century
Bengal. In fact, one of the biggest and most famous of
the eighteenth-century zamindaris, that of Rajshahi,
had a woman at the helm.

4.1 Beyond settled villages
There was more to rural India than sedentary
agriculture. Apart from the intensively cultivated
provinces in northern and north-western India,
huge swathes of forests – dense forest (jangal) or
scrubland (kharbandi) – existed all over eastern
India, central India, northern India (including the
Terai on the Indo-Nepal border), Jharkhand, and in
peninsular India down the Western Ghats and the
Deccan plateau. Though it is nearly impossible to
set an all-India average of the forest cover for this
period, informed conjectures based on contemporary
sources suggest an average of 40 per cent.
Forest
dwellers
termed
jangli
contemporary texts. Being jangli, however, did
not mean an absence of “civilisation”,
as popular usage of the term today
seems to connote. Rather, the term
described those whose livelihood
came from the gathering of forest
produce, hunting and shifting
agriculture. These activities were
largely season specific. Among the
Bhils, for example, spring was reserved
for collecting forest produce, summer
for fishing, the monsoon months
for cultivation, and autumn and
winter for hunting. Such a sequence
presumed and perpetuated mobility,
which was a distinctive feature of
tribes inhabiting these forests.
For the state, the forest was a
subversive place – a place of refuge
(mawas) for troublemakers. Once
again, we turn to Babur who says that
jungles provided a good defence “behind
which the people of the pargana
become stubbornly rebellious and
pay no taxes”.
4.2 Inroads into forests
External forces entered the forest in
different ways. For instance, the state
required elephants for the army. So
the peshkash levied from forest people
often included a supply of elephants.

Describe what you see

symbolic element that helps

between the hunt and

2015-16(20/01/2015)
In the Mughal political ideology, the hunt
symbolised the overwhelming concern of the state
to ensure justice to all its subjects, rich and poor.
Regular hunting expeditions, so court historians tell
us, enabled the emperor to travel across the extensive
territories of his empire and personally attend to the
grievances of its inhabitants. The hunt was a subject
frequently painted by court artists. The painter
resorted to the device of inserting a small scene
somewhere in the picture that functioned as a symbol
of a harmonious reign.

The spread of commercial agriculture was an
important external factor that impinged on the lives
of those who lived in the forests. Forest products –
like honey, beeswax and gum lac – were in great
demand. Some, such as gum lac, became major items
of overseas export from India in the seventeenth
century. Elephants were also captured and sold.
Trade involved an exchange of commodities through
barter as well. Some tribes, like the Lohanis in the
Punjab, were engaged in overland trade, between
India and Afghanistan, and in the town-country
trade in the Punjab itself.
Social factors too wrought changes in the lives of
forest dwellers. Like the “big men” of the village
community, tribes also had their chieftains. Many
tribal chiefs had become zamindars, some even
became kings. For this they required to build up an
army. They recruited people from their lineage
groups or demanded that their fraternity provide
military service. Tribes in the Sind region had armies
comprising 6,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry. In
Assam, the Ahom kings had their paiks, people who
were obliged to render military service in exchange
for land. The capture of wild elephants was declared
a royal monopoly by the Ahom kings.

Though the transition from a tribal to a
monarchical system had started much earlier, the
process seems to have become fully developed only
by the sixteenth century. This can be seen from
the Ain’s observations on the existence of tribal
kingdoms in the north-east. War was a common
occurrence. For instance, the Koch kings fought
and subjugated a number of neighbouring tribes in
a long sequence of wars through the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.
New cultural influences also began to penetrate
into forested zones. Some historians have indeed
suggested that sufi saints (pirs) played a major role
in the slow acceptance of Islam among agricultural
communities emerging in newly colonised places
(see also Chapter 6).

Our story of agrarian relations in Mughal India will
not be complete without referring to a class of
people in the countryside that lived off agriculture
but did not participate directly in the processes of
agricultural production. These were the zamindars
who were landed proprietors who also enjoyed certain
social and economic privileges by virtue of their
superior status in rural society. Caste was one factor
that accounted for the elevated status of zamindars;
another factor was that they performed certain
services (khidmat) for the state.
The zamindars held extensive personal lands
termed milkiyat, meaning property. Milkiyat lands
were cultivated for the private use of zamindars,
often with the help of hired or servile labour. The
zamindars could sell, bequeath or mortgage these
lands at will.
Zamindars also derived their power from the fact
that they could often collect revenue on behalf of
the state, a service for which they were compensated
financially. Control over military resources was
another source of power. Most zamindars had
fortresses (qilachas) as well as an armed contingent
comprising units of cavalry, artillery and infantry.
Thus if we visualise social relations in the
Mughal countryside as a pyramid, zamindars clearly
constituted its very narrow apex. Abu’l Fazl’s account
indicates that an “upper -caste”, Brahmana-Rajput

combine had already established firm control
over rural society. It also reflects a fairly large
representation from the so-called intermediate castes,
as we saw earlier, as well as a liberal sprinkling of
Muslim zamindaris.
Contemporary documents give an impression that
conquest may have been the source of the origin of
some zamindaris. The dispossession of weaker people
by a powerful military chieftain was quite often a
way of expanding a zamindari. It is, however, unlikely
that the state would have allowed such a show of
aggression by a zamindar unless he had been
confirmed by an imperial order (sanad).
More important were the slow processes of
zamindari consolidation, which are also documented
in sources. These involved colonisation of new lands,
by transfer of rights, by order of the state and by
purchase. These were the processes which perhaps
permitted people belonging to the relatively “lower”
castes to enter the rank of zamindars as zamindaris
were bought and sold quite briskly in this period.
A combination of factors also allowed the
consolidation of clan- or lineage-based zamindaris.
For example, the Rajputs and Jats adopted these
strategies to consolidate their control over vast
swathes of territory in northern India. Likewise,
peasant-pastoralists (like the Sadgops) carved out
powerful zamindaris in areas of central and south-
western Bengal.
Zamindars spearheaded the colonisation of
agricultural land, and helped in settling cultivators
by providing them with the means of cultivation,
including cash loans. The buying and selling of
zamindaris accelerated the process of monetisation
in the countryside. In addition, zamindars sold the
produce from their milkiyat lands. There is evidence
to show that zamindars often established markets (haats)
to which peasants also came to sell their produce.
Although there can be little doubt that zamindars
were an exploitative class, their relationship with the
peasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism
and patronage. Two aspects reinforce this view. First,
the bhakti saints, who eloquently condemned
caste-based and other forms of oppression (see also
Chapter 6), did not portray the zamindars (or,
interestingly, the moneylender) as exploiters or
oppressors of the peasantry. Usually it was the

century, zamindars often received the support of the
peasantry in their struggle against the state.

Revenue from the land was the economic mainstay
of the Mughal Empire. It was therefore vital for the
state to create an administrative apparatus to ensure
control over agricultural production, and to fix and
collect revenue from across the length and breadth
of the rapidly expanding empire. This apparatus
included the office (daftar) of the diwan who was
responsible for supervising the fiscal system of the
empire. Thus revenue officials and record keepers
penetrated the agricultural domain and became a
decisive agent in shaping agrarian relations.
The Mughal state tried to first acquire specific
information about the extent of the agricultural
lands in the empire and what these lands produced
before fixing the burden of taxes on people. The
land revenue arrangements consisted of two
stages – first, assessment and then actual collection.
The jama was the amount assessed, as opposed to
hasil, the amount collected. In his list of duties of
the amil-guzar or revenue collector, Akbar decreed
that while he should strive to make cultivators pay
in cash, the option of payment in kind was also to
be kept open. While fixing revenue, the attempt of
the state was to maximise its claims. The scope of
actually realising these claims was, however,
sometimes thwarted by local conditions.
Both cultivated and cultivable lands were measured
in each province. The Ain compiled the aggregates of
such lands during Akbar’s rule. Efforts to measure
lands continued under subsequent emperors. For
instance, in 1665, Aurangzeb expressly instructed his
revenue officials to prepare annual records of the
number of cultivators in each village (Source 7). Yet
not all areas were measured successfully. As we have
seen, forests covered huge areas of the subcontinent
and thus remained unmeasured.

The Mughal Empire was among the large territorial
empires in Asia that had managed to consolidate power
and resources during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. These empires were the Ming (China),
Safavid (Iran) and Ottoman (Turkey). The political
stability achieved by all these empires helped create
vibrant networks of overland trade from China to the
Mediterranean Sea. Voyages of discovery and the
opening up of the New World resulted in a massive
expansion of Asia’s (particularly India’s) trade with
Europe. This resulted in a greater geographical
diversity of India’s overseas trade as well as an

expansion in the commodity composition of this trade.
An expanding trade brought in huge amounts of silver
bullion into Asia to pay for goods procured from India,
and a large part of that bullion gravitated towards
India. This was good for India as it did not have
natural resources of silver. As a result, the period
between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries was
also marked by a remarkable stability in the
availability of metal currency, particularly the silver
rupya in India. This facilitated an unprecedented
expansion of minting of coins and the circulation of
money in the economy as well as the ability of the
Mughal state to extract taxes and revenue in cash.
The testimony of an Italian traveller, Giovanni
Careri, who passed through India c. 1690, provides
a graphic account about the way silver travelled
across the globe to reach India. It also gives us an idea
of the phenomenal amounts of cash and commodity
transactions in seventeenth-century India.

The Ain-i Akbari was the culmination of a large
historical, administrative project of classification
undertaken by Abu’l Fazl at the order of Emperor
Akbar. It was completed in 1598, the forty-second
regnal year of the emperor, after having gone through
five revisions. The Ain was part of a larger project
of history writing commissioned by Akbar. This
history, known as the Akbar Nama, comprised three
books. The first two provided a historical narrative.
We will look at these parts more closely in Chapter
9. The Ain-i Akbari, the third book, was organised
as a compendium of imperial regulations and a
gazetteer of the empire.
The Ain gives detailed accounts of the organisation
of the court, administration and army, the sources
of revenue and the physical layout of the provinces
of Akbar’s empire and the literary, cultural and
religious traditions of the people. Along with a
description of the various departments of Akbar’s
government and elaborate descriptions of the

various provinces (subas) of the empire, the Ain
gives us intricate quantitative information of
those provinces.
Collecting and compiling this information
systematically was an important imperial exercise.
It informed the emperor about the varied and diverse
customs and practices prevailing across his
extensive territories. The Ain is therefore a mine of
information for us about the Mughal Empire during
Akbar’s reign. It is important, however, to keep in
mind that this is a view of the regions from the
centre, a view of society from its apex.
The Ain is made up of five books (daftars), of which
the first three books describe the administration.
The first book, called manzil-abadi, concerns the
imperial household and its maintenance. The second
book, sipah-abadi, covers the military and civil
administration and the establishment of servants.
This book includes notices and short biographical
sketches of imperial officials (mansabdars), learned
men, poets and artists.
The third book, mulk-abadi, is the one which deals
with the fiscal side of the empire and provides rich
quantitative information on revenue rates, followed
by the “Account of the Twelve Provinces”. This section
has detailed statistical information, which includes
the geographic, topographic and economic profile of
all subas and their administrative and fiscal
divisions (sarkars, parganas and mahals), total
measured area, and assessed revenue ( jama ).
After setting out details at the suba level, the Ain
goes on to give a detailed picture of the sarkars below
the suba. This it does in the form of tables, which
have eight columns giving the following information:
(1) parganat/mahal; (2) qila (forts); (3) arazi and
zamin-i paimuda (measured area); (4) naqdi, revenue
assessed in cash; (5) suyurghal, grants of revenue  in
charity; (6) zamindars; columns 7 and 8 contain
details of the castes of these zamindars, and their
troops including their horsemen (sawar), foot-soldiers
(piyada) and elephants (fil ). The mulk-abadi gives a
fascinating, detailed and highly complex view of
agrarian society in northern India. The fourth and
fifth books (daftars) deal with the religious, literary
and cultural traditions of the people of India and also
contain a collection of Akbar’s “auspicious sayings”.

Although the Ain was officially sponsored to record
detailed information to facilitate Emperor Akbar
govern his empire, it was much more than a
reproduction of official papers. That the manuscript
was revised five times by the author would suggest
a high degree of caution on the part of Abu’l Fazl
and a search for authenticity. For instance, oral
testimonies were cross-checked and verified before
being incorporated as “facts” in the chronicle. In
the quantitative sections, all numeric data were
reproduced in words so as to minimise the chances
of subsequent transcriptional errors.
Historians who have carefully studied the Ain point
out that it is not without its problems. Numerous
errors in totalling have been detected. These are
ascribed to simple slips of arithmetic or of
transcription by Abu’l Fazl’s assistants. These are
generally minor and do not detract from the overall
quantitative veracity of the manuals.
Another limitation of the Ain is the somewhat
skewed nature of the quantitative data.  Data were
not collected uniformly from all provinces. For
instance, while for many subas detailed information
was compiled about the caste composition of the
zamindars, such information is not available for
Bengal and Orissa. Further, while the fiscal data
from the subas is remarkable for its richness, some
equally vital parameters such as prices and wages
from these same areas are not as well documented.
The detailed list of prices and wages that the Ain
does provide is mainly derived from data pertaining
to areas in or around the imperial capital of Agra,
and is therefore of limited relevance for the rest of
the country.
These limitations notwithstanding, the Ain remains
an extraordinary document of its times. By providing
fascinating glimpses into the structure and
organisation of the Mughal Empire and by giving us
quantitative information about its products and
people, Abu’l Fazl achieved a major breakthrough
in the tradition of medieval chroniclers who wrote
mostly about remarkable political events – wars,
conquests, political machinations, and dynastic
turmoil. Information about the country, its people

and its products was mentioned only incidentally
and as embellishments to the essentially political
thrust of the narrative.
The Ain completely departed from this tradition as
it recorded information about the empire and the people
of India, and thus constitutes a benchmark for
studying India at the turn of the seventeenth century.
The value of the Ain’s quantitative evidence is
uncontested where the study of agrarian relations
is concerned. But it is the information it contains on
people, their professions and trades and on the
imperial establishment and the grandees of the empire
which enables historians to reconstruct the social
fabric of India at that time.

THEME
The rulers of the Mughal Empire saw themselves
as appointed by Divine Will to rule over a large
and heterogeneous populace. Although this
grand vision was often circumscribed by actual
political circumstances, it remained
important. One way of transmitting
this vision was through the
writing of dynastic histories. The
Mughal kings commissioned court
historians to write accounts. These
accounts recorded the events of the
emperor’s time. In addition, their
writers collected vast amounts of
information from the regions of the
subcontinent to help the rulers
govern their domain.
Modern historians writing in
English have termed this genre
of texts chronicles, as they
present a continuous chronological
record  of events. Chronicles are
an indispensable source for any
scholar wishing to write a history
of the Mughals. At one level
they were a repository of factual
information about the institutions
of the Mughal state, painstakingly
collected
classified
individuals closely connected with the court. At
the same time these texts were intended as
conveyors of meanings that the Mughal rulers
sought to impose on their domain. They therefore
give us a glimpse into how imperial ideologies
were created and disseminated. This chapter will
look at the workings of this rich and fascinating
dimension of the Mughal Empire.

1. The Mughals and Their Empire
The name Mughal derives from Mongol. Though today
the term evokes the grandeur of an empire, it was
not the name the rulers of the dynasty chose for
themselves. They referred to themselves as Timurids,
as descendants of the Turkish ruler Timur on the
paternal side. Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was
related to Ghenghiz Khan from his mother’s side.
He spoke Turkish and referred derisively to the
Mongols as barbaric hordes.
During the sixteenth century, Europeans used the
term Mughal to describe the Indian rulers of this
branch of the family. Over the past centuries the
word has been frequently used – even the name
Mowgli, the young hero of Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle
Book, is derived from it.
The empire was carved out of a number of regional
states of India through conquests and political
alliances between the Mughals and local chieftains.
The founder of the empire, Zahiruddin Babur, was
driven from his Central Asian homeland, Farghana,
by the warring Uzbeks. He first established himself
at Kabul and then in 1526 pushed further into
the Indian subcontinent in search of territories and
resources to satisfy the needs of the members of
his clan.
His successor, Nasiruddin Humayun (1530-40,
1555-56) expanded the frontiers of the empire, but
lost it to the Afghan leader Sher Shah Sur, who drove
him into exile. Humayun took refuge in the court of
the Safavid ruler of Iran. In 1555 Humayun defeated
the Surs, but died a year later.
Many consider Jalaluddin Akbar (1556-1605) the
greatest of all the Mughal emperors, for he not only
expanded but also consolidated his empire, making
it the largest, strongest and richest kingdom of
his time. Akbar succeeded in extending the frontiers
of the empire to the Hindukush mountains, and
checked the expansionist designs of the Uzbeks of
Turan (Central Asia) and the Safavids of Iran.
Akbar had three fairly able successors in Jahangir
(1605-27), Shah Jahan (1628-58) and Aurangzeb
(1658-1707), much as their characters varied. Under
them the territorial expansion continued, though at
a much reduced pace. The three rulers maintained and
consolidated the various instruments of governance.

THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY – PART II
During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the institutions of an imperial structure were created.
These included effective methods of administration
and taxation. The visible centre of Mughal power was
the court. Here political alliances and relationships
were forged, status and hierarchies defined. The
political system devised by the Mughals was based
on a combination of military power and conscious
policy to accommodate the different traditions they
encountered in the subcontinent.
After 1707, following the death of Aurangzeb, the
power of the dynasty diminished. In place of the vast
apparatus of empire controlled from Delhi, Agra or
Lahore – the different capital cities – regional powers
acquired greater autonomy. Yet symbolically the
prestige of the Mughal ruler did not lose its aura. In
1857 the last scion of this dynasty, Bahadur Shah
Zafar II, was overthrown by the British.
2. The Production of Chronicles
Chronicles commissioned by the Mughal emperors
are an important source for studying the empire and
its court. They were written in order to project a
vision of an enlightened kingdom to all those who
came under its umbrella. At the same time they were
meant to convey to those who resisted the rule of
the Mughals that all resistance was destined to fail.
Also, the rulers wanted to ensure that there was an
account of their rule for posterity.
The authors of Mughal chronicles were invariably
courtiers. The histories they wrote focused on events
centred on the ruler, his family, the court and nobles,
wars and administrative arrangements. Their titles,
such as the Akbar Nama, Shahjahan Nama, Alamgir
Nama, that is, the story of Akbar, Shah Jahan and
Alamgir (a title of the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb),
suggest that in the eyes of their authors the history
of the empire and the court was  synonymous with
that of the emperor.
2.1 From Turkish to Persian
Mughal court chronicles were written in Persian.
Under the Sultans of Delhi it flourished as a
language of the court and of literary writings,
alongside north Indian languages, especially Hindavi
and its regional variants. As the Mughals were
Chaghtai Turks by origin, Turkish was their mother

tongue. Their first ruler Babur wrote poetry and his
memoirs in this language.
It was Akbar who consciously set out to make
Persian the leading language of the Mughal court.
Cultural and intellectual contacts with Iran, as well
as a regular stream of Iranian and Central Asian
migrants seeking positions at the Mughal court,
might have motivated the emperor to adopt the
language. Persian was elevated to a language of
empire, conferring power and prestige on those who
had a command of it. It was spoken by the king, the
royal household and the elite at court. Further, it
became the language of administration at all levels
so that accountants, clerks and other functionaries
also learnt it.
Even when Persian was not directly used, its
vocabulary and idiom heavily influenced the language
of official records in Rajasthani and Marathi and
even Tamil. Since the people using Persian in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries came from
many different regions of the subcontinent and
spoke other Indian languages, Persian too became
Indianised by absorbing local idioms. A new
language, Urdu, sprang from the interaction of
Persian with Hindavi.
Mughal chronicles such as the Akbar Nama were
written in Persian, others, like Babur’s memoirs,
were translated from the Turkish into the Persian
Babur Nama. Translations of Sanskrit texts such as
the Mahabharata and the Ramayana into Persian
were commissioned by the Mughal emperors. The
Mahabharata was translated as the Razmnama
(Book of Wars).
2.2 The making of manuscripts
All books in Mughal India were manuscripts, that
is, they were handwritten. The centre of manuscript
production was the imperial kitabkhana. Although
kitabkhana can be translated as library, it was a
scriptorium, that is, a place where the emperor’s
collection of manuscripts was kept and new
manuscripts were produced.
The creation of a manuscript involved a number
of people performing a variety of tasks. Paper makers
were needed to prepare the folios of the manuscript,
scribes or calligraphers to copy the text, gilders to
illuminate the pages, painters to illustrate scenes
The flight of the
written word
In Abu’l Fazl’s words:
The written word may
embody the wisdom of
bygone ages and may
become
means
intellectual progress. The
spoken word goes to the
heart of those who are
present to hear it. The written
word gives wisdom to those
who are near and far. If it was
not for the written word, the
spoken word would soon
die, and no keepsake would
be left us from those who are
passed away. Superficial
observers see in the letter a
dark figure, but the deep-
sighted see in it a lamp of
wisdom (chirag-i shinasai ).
The written word looks black,
notwithstanding the thousand
rays within it, or it is a light
with a mole on it that wards
off the evil eye. A letter
(khat ) is the portrait of
wisdom; a rough sketch from
the realm of ideas; a dark
light ushering in day; a
black cloud pregnant with
knowledge; speaking though
dumb;
stationary
travelling; stretched on the
sheet, and yet soaring
upwards.

from the text, bookbinders to gather the individual
folios and set them within ornamental covers. The
finished manuscript was seen as a precious object,
a work of intellectual wealth and beauty. It
exemplified the power of its patron, the Mughal
emperor, to bring such beauty into being.
At the same time some of the people involved in
the actual production of the manuscript also got
recognition in the form of titles and awards. Of these,
calligraphers and painters held a high social
standing while others, such as paper makers or
bookbinders, have remained anonymous artisans.
Calligraphy, the art of handwriting, was considered
a skill of great importance. It was practised using
different styles. Akbar’s favourite was the nastaliq, a
fluid style with long horizontal strokes. It is written
using a piece of trimmed reed with a tip of five to 10
mm called qalam, dipped in carbon ink (siyahi). The
nib of the qalam is usually split in the middle to
facilitate the absorption of ink.

In what ways do you think the production of books
today is similar to or different from the ways in
which Mughal chronicles were produced?
3. The Painted Image
As we read in the previous section, painters too were
involved in the production of Mughal manuscripts.
Chronicles narrating the events of a Mughal emperor’s
reign contained, alongside the written text, images
that described an event in visual form. When scenes
or themes in a book were to be given visual expression,
the scribe left blank spaces on nearby pages;
paintings, executed separately by artists, were
inserted to accompany what was described in words.
These paintings were miniatures, and could therefore
be passed around for viewing and mounting on the
pages of manuscripts.
Paintings served not only to enhance the beauty of
a book, but were believed to possess special powers
of communicating ideas about the kingdom and the
power of kings in ways that the written medium could
not. The historian Abu’l Fazl described painting as
a “magical art”: in his view it had the power to make
inanimate objects look as if they possessed life.

The production of paintings portraying the
emperor, his court and the people who were part of
it, was a source of constant tension between rulers
and representatives of the Muslim orthodoxy, the
ulama. The latter did not fail to invoke the Islamic
prohibition of the portrayal of human beings
enshrined in the Qur’an as well as the hadis, which
described an incident from the life of the Prophet
Muhammad. Here the Prophet is cited as having
forbidden the depiction of living beings in a
naturalistic manner as it would suggest that the
artist was seeking to appropriate the power of
creation. This was a function that was believed to
belong exclusively to God.

In praise of taswir
Abu’l Fazl held the art of painting
in high esteem:
Drawing the likeness of
anything is called taswir. His
Majesty from his earliest youth,
has shown a great predilection
for this art, and gives it every
encouragement, as he looks
upon it as a means both of study
and amusement. A very large
number of painters have been
set to work. Each week, several
supervisors and clerks of the
imperial workshop submit
before the emperor the work
done by each artist, and His
Majesty gives a reward and
increases the monthly salaries
of the artists according to the
excellence displayed. … Most
excellent painters are now to
be found, and masterpieces,
worthy of a Bihzad, may be
placed at the side of the
wonderful works of the
European painters who have
attained worldwide fame. The
minuteness in detail, the
general finish and the boldness
of execution now observed in
pictures are incomparable;
even inanimate objects look as
if they have life. More than a
hundred painters have become
famous masters of the art. This
is especially true of the Hindu
artists. Their pictures surpass
our conception of things. Few,
indeed, in the whole world are
found equal to them.

consider the art of
painting important?

legitimise this art?

Yet interpretations of the shari‘a changed with
time. The body of Islamic tradition was interpreted
in different ways by various social groups. Frequently
each group put forward an understanding of tradition
that would best suit their political needs. Muslim
rulers in many Asian regions during centuries of
empire building regularly commissioned artists to
paint their portraits and scenes of life in their
kingdoms. The Safavid kings of Iran, for example,
patronised the finest artists, who were trained in
workshops set up at court. The names of painters –
such as that of Bihzad – contributed to spreading
the cultural fame of the Safavid court far and wide.
Artists from Iran also made their way to Mughal
India. Some were brought to the Mughal court, as in
the case of Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus Samad, who
were made to accompany Emperor Humayun to
Delhi. Others migrated in search of opportunities to
win patronage and prestige. A conflict between the
emperor and the spokesmen of orthodox Muslim
opinion on the question of visual representations of
living beings was a source of tension at the Mughal
court. Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl cites the
emperor as saying: “There are many that hate
painting, but such men I dislike. It appears to me
that an artist has a unique way of recognising God
when he must come to feel that he cannot bestow
life on his work ...”
4. The Akbar Nama and the
Badshah Nama
Among the important illustrated Mughal chronicles
the Akbar Nama and Badshah Nama (The Chronicle
of a King) are the most well known. Each
manuscript contained an average of 150 full- or
double-page paintings of battles, sieges, hunts,
building construction, court scenes, etc.
The author of the Akbar Nama, Abu’l Fazl grew up
in the Mughal capital of Agra. He was widely read in
Arabic, Persian, Greek philosophy and Sufism.
Moreover, he was a forceful debater and independent
thinker who consistently opposed the views of the
conservative ulama. These qualities impressed Akbar,
who found Abu’l Fazl ideally suited as an adviser
and a spokesperson for his policies. One major

objective of the emperor was to free the state from
the control of religious orthodoxy. In his role as court
historian, Abu’l Fazl both shaped and articulated
the ideas associated with the reign of Akbar.
Beginning in 1589, Abu’l Fazl worked on the Akbar
Nama for thirteen years, repeatedly revising the draft.
The chronicle is based on a range of sources, including
actual records of events (waqai), official documents
and oral testimonies of knowledgeable persons.
The Akbar Nama is divided into three books of
which the first two are chronicles. The third book is
the Ain-i Akbari. The first volume contains the history
of mankind from Adam to one celestial cycle of Akbar’s
life (30 years). The second volume closes in the forty-
sixth regnal year (1601) of Akbar. The very next year
Abu’l Fazl fell victim to a conspiracy hatched by
Prince Salim, and was murdered by his accomplice,
Bir Singh Bundela.
The Akbar Nama was written to provide a detailed
description of Akbar’s reign in the traditional
diachronic sense of recording politically significant
events across time, as well as in the more novel sense
of giving a synchronic picture of all aspects of Akbar’s
empire – geographic, social, administrative and
cultural – without reference to chronology. In the
Ain-i Akbari the Mughal Empire is presented as having
a diverse population consisting of Hindus, Jainas,
Buddhists and Muslims and a composite culture.
Abu’l Fazl wrote in a language that was ornate
and which attached importance to diction and
rhythm, as texts were often read aloud. This Indo-
Persian style was patronised at court, and there
were a large number of writers who wanted to write
like Abu’l Fazl.
A pupil of Abu’l Fazl, Abdul Hamid Lahori is
known as the author of the Badshah Nama. Emperor
Shah Jahan, hearing of his talents, commissioned
him to write a history of his reign modelled on the
Akbar Nama. The Badshah Nama is this official
history in three volumes (daftars) of ten lunar years
each. Lahori wrote the first and second daftars
comprising the first two decades of the emperor’s
rule (1627-47); these volumes were later revised by
Sadullah Khan, Shah Jahan’s wazir. Infirmities of
old age prevented Lahori from proceeding with the
third decade which was then chronicled by the
historian Waris.
A diachronic account traces
developments over time,
whereas a synchronic account
depicts one or several situations
at one particular moment or
point of time.
Travels of the
Badshah Nama
Gifting of precious manuscripts
was an established diplomatic
custom under the Mughals.
In emulation of this, the
Nawab of Awadh gifted the
illustrated Badshah Nama to
King George III in 1799. Since
then it has been preserved in
the English Royal Collections,
now at Windsor Castle.
In 1994, conservation work
required the bound manuscript
to be taken apart. This made
it possible to exhibit the
paintings, and in 1997 for the
first time, the Badshah Nama
paintings were shown in
exhibitions in New Delhi,
London and Washington.

During the colonial period, British administrators
began to study Indian history and to create an
archive of knowledge about the subcontinent to
help them better understand the people and the
cultures of the empire they sought to rule. The
Asiatic Society of Bengal, founded by Sir William
Jones in 1784, undertook the editing, printing and
translation of many Indian manuscripts.
Edited versions of the Akbar Nama and Badshah
Nama were first published by the Asiatic Society
in the nineteenth century. In the early twentieth
century the Akbar Nama was translated into English
by Henry Beveridge after years of hard labour. Only
excerpts of the Badshah Nama have been translated
into English to date; the text in its entirety still
awaits translation.

5. The Ideal Kingdom
5.1 A divine light
Court chroniclers drew upon many sources to show
that the power of the Mughal kings came directly
from God. One of the legends they narrated was that
of the Mongol queen Alanqua, who was impregnated
by a ray of sunshine while resting in her tent. The
offspring she bore carried this Divine Light and
passed it on from generation to generation.
Abu’l Fazl placed Mughal kingship as the highest
station in the hierarchy of objects receiving light
emanating from God (farr-i izadi ). Here he was
inspired by a famous Iranian sufi, Shihabuddin
Suhrawardi (d. 1191) who first developed this idea.
According to this idea, there was a hierarchy in
which the Divine Light was transmitted to the king
who then became the source of spiritual guidance
for his subjects.
Paintings that accompanied the narrative of the
chronicles transmitted these ideas in a way that
The transmission of

The origins of Suhrawardi’s
philosophy went back to
Plato’s Republic, where God is
represented by the symbol of
the sun. Suhrawardi’s writings
were universally read in the
Islamic world. They were
studied by Shaikh Mubarak,
who transmitted their ideas to
his sons, Faizi and Abu’l Fazl,
who were trained under him.

left a lasting impression on the minds of viewers.
Mughal artists, from the seventeenth century
onwards, began to portray emperors wearing the halo,
which they saw on European paintings of Christ and
the Virgin Mary to symbolise the light of God.
5.2 A unifying force
Mughal chronicles present the empire as comprising
many different ethnic and religious communities –
Hindus, Jainas, Zoroastrians and Muslims. As the
source of all peace and stability the emperor stood
above all religious and ethnic groups, mediated
among them, and ensured that justice and peace
prevailed. Abu’l Fazl describes the ideal of sulh-i kul
(absolute peace) as the cornerstone of enlightened
rule. In sulh-i kul all religions and schools of thought
had freedom of expression but on condition that they
did not undermine the authority of the state or fight
among themselves.
The ideal of sulh-i kul was implemented through
state policies – the nobility under the Mughals was
a composite one comprising Iranis, Turanis, Afghans,
Rajputs, Deccanis – all of whom were given positions
and awards purely on the basis of their service and

dressed in resplendent clothes and jewels, holding

Akbar is dressed in white, associated in sufi
traditions with the enlightened soul. He proffers
a globe, symbolic of dynastic authority.
In the Mughal empire there was no law laying
down which of the emperor’s sons would succeed
to the throne. This meant that every dynastic
change was accompanied and decided by a
fratricidal war. Towards the end of Akbar’s reign,
Prince Salim revolted against his father, seized
power and assumed the title of Jahangir.

relationship between father and son?

loyalty to the king. Further,
Akbar abolished the tax on
pilgrimage in 1563 and jizya
in 1564 as the two were based
on religious discrimination.
Instructions were sent to
officers of the empire to
follow the precept of sulh-i kul
in administration.
All Mughal emperors gave
grants
support
building and maintenance of
places of worship. Even when
temples were destroyed
during war, grants were later
issued for their repair – as
we know from the reigns of
Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb.
However, during the reign of
the latter, the jizya was re-
imposed on non-Muslim
subjects.
5.3 Just sovereignty as
social contract
Abu’l Fazl defined sovereignty
as a social contract: the
emperor protects the four
essences of his subjects,
namely, life (jan), property
(mal), honour (namus) and
faith (din), and in return
demands obedience and a
share of resources. Only just
sovereigns were thought
to be able to honour the
contract with power and
Divine guidance.

A number of symbols were created for visual
representation of the idea of justice which came to
stand for the highest virtue of Mughal monarchy.
One of the favourite symbols used by artists was
the motif of the lion and the lamb (or goat) peacefully
nestling next to each other. This was meant to signify
a realm where both the strong and the weak could
exist in harmony. Court scenes from the illustrated
Badshah Nama place such motifs in a niche directly
below the emperor’s throne (see Fig. 9.6).

that this is not a real person, but

mode of personification in art
and literature is termed allegory.
The Chain of Justice is shown
descending from heaven.
This is how Jahangir described
the Chain of Justice in
his memoirs:
After my accession, the first
order that I gave was for the
fastening up of the Chain
of Justice, so that if those
engaged in the administration
of justice should delay or
practise hypocrisy in the
matter of those seeking justice,
the oppressed might come to
this chain and shake it so
that its noise might attract
attention. The chain was made
of pure gold, 30 gaz in length

6. Capitals and Courts
6.1 Capital cities
The heart of the Mughal Empire was its capital city,
where the court assembled. The capital cities of the
Mughals frequently shifted during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Babur took over the Lodi
capital of Agra, though during the four years of his
reign the court was frequently on the move. During
the 1560s Akbar had the fort of Agra constructed
with red sandstone quarried from the adjoining regions.
In the 1570s he decided to build a new capital,
Fatehpur Sikri. One of the reasons prompting
this may have been that Sikri was located on the
direct road to Ajmer, where the dargah of Shaikh
Muinuddin Chishti had become an important
pilgrimage centre. The Mughal emperors entered
into a close relationship with sufis of the Chishti
silsila. Akbar commissioned the
construction of a white marble tomb
for Shaikh Salim Chishti next to the
majestic Friday mosque at Sikri.
The enormous arched gateway
(Buland Darwaza) was meant to
remind visitors of the Mughal victory
in Gujarat. In 1585 the capital was
transferred to Lahore to bring the
north-west under greater control
and Akbar closely watched the
frontier for thirteen years.
Shah Jahan pursued sound fiscal
policies and accumulated enough
money to indulge his passion for
building.
Building

seen in the case of earlier rulers,  was
the most visible and tangible sign
of dynastic power, wealth and
prestige. In the case of Muslim rulers
it was also considered an act of piety.
In 1648 the court, army and
household moved from Agra to the
newly completed imperial capital,
Shahjahanabad. It was a new
addition to the old residential city of
Delhi, with the Red Fort, the Jama
Masjid, a tree-lined esplanade with

bazaars (Chandni Chowk) and spacious homes for
the nobility. Shah Jahan’s new city was appropriate
to a more formal vision of a grand monarchy.
6.2 The Mughal court
The physical arrangement of the court, focused
on the sovereign, mirrored his status as the heart
of society. Its centrepiece was therefore the throne,
the takht, which gave physical form to the function
of the sovereign as axis mundi. The canopy, a
symbol of kingship in India for a millennium, was
believed to separate the radiance of the sun from
that of the sovereign.
Chronicles lay down with great precision the rules
defining status amongst the Mughal elites. In court,
status was determined by spatial proximity to the
king. The place accorded to a courtier by the ruler
was a sign of his importance in the eyes of the
emperor. Once the emperor sat on the throne, no
one was permitted to move from his position or to
leave without permission. Social control in court
society was exercised through carefully defining in

Kornish was a form of
ceremonial salutation in which
the courtier placed the palm of
his right hand against his
forehead and bent his head. It

hand of humility, presenting it

KINGS AND CHRONICLES
Darbar-i Akbari
Abu’l Fazl gives a vivid account of Akbar’s darbar:
Whenever His Majesty (Akbar) holds court (darbar)
a large drum is beaten, the sounds of which are
accompanied by Divine praise. In this manner, people
of all classes receive notice. His Majesty’s sons and
grandchildren, the grandees of the Court, and all
other men who have admittance, attend to make the
kornish, and remain standing in their proper places.
Learned men of renown and skilful mechanics pay
their respects; and the officers of justice present their
reports. His Majesty, with his usual insights, gives
orders, and settles everything in a satisfactory
manner. During the whole time, skilful gladiators and
wrestlers from all countries hold themselves in
readiness, and singers, male and female, are in
waiting. Clever jugglers and funny tumblers also are
anxious to exhibit their dexterity and agility.

Shab-i barat is the full moon
night on the 14 Shaban, the
eighth month of the hijri
calendar, and is celebrated with
prayers and fireworks in the
subcontinent.  It is the night
when the destinies of the
Muslims for the coming year
are said to be determined and
sins forgiven.
full detail the forms of address, courtesies and
speech which were acceptable in court. The slightest
infringement of etiquette was noticed and punished
on the spot.
The forms of salutation to the ruler indicated the
person’s status in the hierarchy: deeper prostration
represented higher status. The highest form of
submission was sijda or complete prostration. Under
Shah Jahan these rituals were replaced with chahar
taslim and zaminbos (kissing the ground).
The protocols governing diplomatic envoys at the
Mughal court were equally explicit. An ambassador
presented to the Mughal emperor was expected to
offer an acceptable form of greeting – either by bowing
deeply or kissing the ground, or else to follow the
Persian custom of clasping one’s hands in front of
the chest. Thomas Roe, the English envoy of James I,
simply bowed before Jahangir according to
European custom, and further shocked the court by
demanding a chair.
The emperor began his day at sunrise with
personal religious devotions or prayers, and then
appeared on a small balcony, the jharoka, facing the
east. Below, a crowd of people (soldiers, merchants,
craftspersons, peasants, women with sick children)
waited for a view, darshan, of the emperor. Jharoka
darshan was introduced by Akbar with the objective
of broadening the acceptance of the imperial
authority as part of popular faith.
Chahar taslim is a mode of
salutation which begins with
placing the back of the right
hand on the ground, and
raising it gently till the person
stands erect, when he puts the
palm of his hand upon the
crown of his head.  It is done
four (chahar) times. Taslim
literally means submission.
The jewelled throne
This is how Shah Jahan’s jewelled throne (takht-i murassa) in the hall of public audience in
the Agra palace is described in the Badshah Nama:
This gorgeous structure has a canopy supported by twelve-sided pillars and measures
five cubits in height from the flight of steps to the overhanging dome. On His Majesty’s
coronation, he had commanded that 86 lakh worth of gems and precious stones, and
one lakh tolas of gold worth another 14 lakh, should be used in decorating it. … The
throne was completed in the course of seven years, and among the precious stones used
upon it was a ruby worth one lakh of rupees that Shah Abbas Safavi had sent to the late
emperor Jahangir.  And on this ruby were inscribed the names of the great emperor
Timur Sahib-i qiran, Mirza Shahrukh, Mirza Ulugh Beg, and Shah Abbas as well as the
names of the emperors Akbar, Jahangir, and that of His Majesty himself.

After spending an hour at the jharoka, the emperor
walked to the public hall of audience (diwan-i am) to
conduct the primary business of his government.
State officials presented reports and made requests.
Two hours later, the emperor was in the diwan-i khas
to hold private audiences and discuss confidential
matters. High ministers of state placed their petitions
before him and tax officials presented their accounts.
Occasionally, the emperor viewed the works of highly
reputed artists or building plans of architects (mimar).
On special occasions such as the anniversary of
accession to the throne, Id, Shab-i barat and Holi,
the court was full of life. Perfumed candles set in
rich holders and palace walls festooned with
colourful hangings made a tremendous impression
on visitors. The Mughal kings celebrated three major

Dara Shukoh’s wedding
Weddings were celebrated lavishly in the imperial
household. In 1633 the wedding of Dara Shukoh
and Nadira, the daughter of Prince Parwez, was
arranged by Princess Jahanara and Sati un Nisa
Khanum, the chief maid of the late empress,
Mumtaz Mahal. An exhibition of the wedding gifts
was arranged in the diwan-i am. In the afternoon
the emperor and the ladies of the harem paid a
visit to it, and in the evening nobles were allowed
access. The bride’s mother similarly arranged her
presents in the same hall and Shah Jahan went to

ceremony was performed in the  diwan-i khas.

The total cost of the wedding was Rs 32 lakh, of which Rs six lakh
was contributed by the imperial treasury, Rs 16 lakh by Jahanara
(including the amount earlier set aside by Mumtaz Mahal) and the

various commodities which were then distributed in charity.
6.3 Titles and gifts
Grand titles were adopted by the Mughal emperors at the
time of coronation or after a victory over an enemy. High-
sounding and rhythmic, they created an atmosphere of
awe in the audience when announced by ushers (naqib).
Mughal coins carried the full title of the reigning emperor
with regal protocol.
The granting of titles to men of merit was an important
aspect of Mughal polity. A man’s ascent in the court
hierarchy could be traced through the titles he held. The
title Asaf Khan for one of the highest ministers originated
with Asaf, the legendary minister of the prophet king
Sulaiman (Solomon). The title Mirza Raja was accorded by
Aurangzeb to his two highest-ranking nobles, Jai Singh and
Jaswant Singh. Titles could be earned or paid for. Mir Khan
offered Rs one lakh to Aurangzeb for the letter alif, that is
A, to be added to his name to make it Amir Khan.
Other awards included the robe of honour (khilat), a
garment once worn by the emperor and imbued with his
benediction. One gift, the sarapa (“head to foot”), consisted
of a tunic, a turban and a sash (patka). Jewelled ornaments
were often given as gifts by the emperor. The lotus blossom
set with jewels (padma murassa) was given only in
exceptional circumstances.
A courtier never approached the emperor empty handed:
he offered either a small sum of money (nazr) or a large
amount (peshkash). In diplomatic relations, gifts
were regarded as a sign of honour and respect.
Ambassadors performed the important function of
negotiating treaties and relationships between
competing political powers. In such a context gifts
had an important symbolic role. Thomas Roe was
disappointed when a ring he had presented to Asaf
Khan was returned to him for the reason that it was
worth merely 400 rupees.

7. The Imperial Household
The term “harem” is frequently used to refer to the
domestic world of the Mughals. It originates in the
Persian word haram, meaning a sacred place. The
Mughal household consisted of the emperor’s wives
and concubines, his near and distant relatives
(mother, step- and foster-mothers, sisters, daughters,
daughters-in-law, aunts, children, etc.), and female
servants and slaves. Polygamy was practised widely
in the Indian subcontinent, especially among the
ruling groups.
Both for the Rajput clans as well as the Mughals
marriage was a way of cementing political
relationships and forging alliances. The gift of
territory was often accompanied by the gift of a
daughter in marriage. This ensured a continuing
hierarchical relationship between ruling groups. It
was through the link of marriage and the
relationships that developed as a result that the
Mughals were able to form a vast kinship network
that linked them to important groups and helped to
hold a vast empire together.
In the Mughal household a distinction was
maintained between wives who came from royal
families (begams), and other wives (aghas) who were
not of noble birth. The begams, married after
receiving huge amounts of cash and valuables as
dower (mahr), naturally received a higher status
and greater attention from their husbands than did
aghas. The concubines (aghacha or the lesser agha)
occupied the lowest position in the hierarchy of
females intimately related to royalty. They all
received monthly allowances in cash, supplemented
with gifts according to their status. The lineage-
based family structure was not entirely static. The
agha and the aghacha could rise to the position
of a begam depending on the husband’s will, and
provided that he did not already have four wives.
Love and motherhood played important roles in
elevating such women to the status of legally
wedded wives.
Apart from wives, numerous male and female slaves
populated the Mughal household. The tasks they
performed varied from the most mundane to those
requiring skill, tact and intelligence. Slave eunuchs
(khwajasara) moved between the external and

internal life of the household as guards, servants,
and also as agents for women dabbling in commerce.
After Nur Jahan, Mughal queens and princesses
began to control significant financial resources. Shah
Jahan’s daughters Jahanara and Roshanara enjoyed
an annual income often equal to that of high imperial
mansabdars. Jahanara, in addition, received revenues
from the port city of Surat, which was a lucrative centre
of overseas trade.
Control over resources enabled important women
of the Mughal household to commission buildings and
gardens. Jahanara participated in many architectural
projects of Shah Jahan’s new capital,
Shahjahanabad (Delhi). Among these
was an imposing double-storeyed
caravanserai with a courtyard and
garden. The bazaar of Chandni Chowk,
the throbbing centre of Shahjahanabad,
was designed by Jahanara.
An interesting book giving us
a glimpse into the domestic world
of the Mughals is the Humayun
Nama written by Gulbadan Begum.
Gulbadan was the daughter of Babur,
Humayun’s sister and Akbar’s aunt.
Gulbadan could write fluently in
Turkish and Persian. When Akbar
commissioned Abu’l Fazl to write a
history of his reign, he requested his
aunt to record her memoirs of earlier
times under Babur and Humayun,
for Abu’l Fazl to draw upon.
What Gulbadan wrote was no
eulogy of the Mughal emperors.
Rather she described in great detail
the conflicts and tensions among the
princes and kings and the important
mediating role elderly women of the
family played in resolving some of
these conflicts.

8. The Imperial Officials
8.1 Recruitment and rank
Mughal chronicles, especially the Akbar Nama, have
bequeathed a vision of empire in which agency rests
almost solely with the emperor, while the rest of the
kingdom has been portrayed as following his orders.
Yet if we look more closely at the rich information
these histories provide about the apparatus of the
Mughal state, we may be able to understand the
ways in which the imperial organisation was
dependent on several different institutions to be able
to function effectively. One important pillar of the
Mughal state was its corps of officers, also referred
to by historians collectively as the nobility.
The nobility was recruited from diverse ethnic and
religious groups. This ensured that no faction was
large enough to challenge the authority of the state.
The officer corps of the Mughals was described as a
bouquet of flowers (guldasta) held together by loyalty
to the emperor. In Akbar’s imperial service, Turani
and Iranian nobles were present from the earliest
phase of carving out a political dominion. Many had
accompanied Humayun; others migrated later to the
Mughal court.
The Mughal nobility
This is how Chandrabhan Barahman described the Mughal nobility in his book
Char Chaman  (Four Gardens), written during the reign of Shah Jahan:
People from many races (Arabs, Iranians, Turks, Tajiks, Kurds, Tatars, Russians,
Abyssinians, and so on) and from many countries (Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Iraq,
Arabia, Iran, Khurasan, Turan) – in fact, different groups and classes of people
from all societies – have sought refuge in the imperial court, as well as different
groups from India, men with knowledge and skills as well as warriors, for
example, Bukharis and Bhakkaris, Saiyyads of genuine lineage, Shaikhzadas with
noble ancestry, Afghan tribes such as the Lodis, Rohillas, Yusufzai, and castes of
Rajputs, who were to be addressed as rana, raja, rao and rayan – i.e. Rathor,
Sisodia, Kachhwaha, Hada, Gaur, Chauhan, Panwar, Bhaduriya, Solanki,
Bundela, Shekhawat, and all the other Indian tribes, such as Ghakkar, Khokar,
Baluchi, and others who wielded the sword, and mansabs from 100 to 7000
zat, likewise landowners from the steppes and mountains, from the regions
of Karnataka, Bengal, Assam, Udaipur, Srinagar, Kumaon, Tibet and Kishtwar
and so on – whole tribes and groups of them have been privileged to kiss the
threshold of the imperial court (i.e. attend the court or find employment).

Two ruling groups of Indian origin entered the
imperial service from 1560 onwards: the Rajputs and
the Indian Muslims (Shaikhzadas). The first to join
was a Rajput chief, Raja Bharmal Kachhwaha of
Amber, to whose daughter Akbar got married.
Members of Hindu castes inclined towards education
and accountancy were also promoted, a famous
example being Akbar’s finance minister, Raja Todar
Mal, who belonged to the Khatri caste.
Iranians gained high offices under Jahangir, whose
politically influential queen, Nur Jahan (d. 1645),
was an Iranian. Aurangzeb appointed Rajputs to high
positions, and under him the Marathas accounted
for a sizeable number within the body of officers.
All holders of government offices held ranks
(mansabs) comprising two numerical designations:
zat which was an indicator of position in the
imperial hierarchy and the salary of the official
(mansabdar), and sawar which indicated the
number of horsemen he was required to maintain
in service. In the seventeenth century, mansabdars
of 1,000 zat or above ranked as nobles (umara,
which is the plural of amir).
The nobles participated in military campaigns with
their armies and also served as officers of the empire
in the provinces. Each military commander recruited,
equipped and trained the main striking arm of
the Mughal army, the cavalry. The troopers
maintained superior horses branded on the flank by
the imperial mark (dagh). The emperor personally
reviewed changes in rank, titles and official postings
for all except the lowest-ranked officers. Akbar,
who designed the mansab system, also established
spiritual relationships with a select band of his
nobility by treating them as his disciples (murid).
For members of the nobility, imperial service was
a way of acquiring power, wealth and the highest
possible reputation. A person wishing to join the
service petitioned through a noble, who presented a
tajwiz to the emperor. If the applicant was found
suitable a mansab was granted to him. The mir
bakhshi (paymaster general) stood in open court on
the right of the emperor and presented all candidates
for appointment or promotion, while his office
prepared orders bearing his seal and signature as
well as those of the emperor. There were two other
important ministers at the centre: the diwan-i ala

Nobles at court
The Jesuit priest Father Antonio
Monserrate, resident at the
court of Akbar, noticed:
In order to prevent the great
nobles becoming insolent
through the unchallenged
enjoyment of power, the
King summons them to
court and gives them
imperious commands, as
though they were his slaves.
The obedience to these
commands ill suits their
exalted rank and dignity.

(finance minister) and sadr-us sudur (minister of
grants or madad-i maash, and in charge of appointing
local judges or qazis). The three ministers
occasionally came together as an advisory body,
but were independent of each other. Akbar with
these and other advisers shaped the administrative,
fiscal and monetary institutions of the empire.
Nobles stationed at the court (tainat-i rakab) were
a reserve force to be deputed to a province or military
campaign. They were duty-bound to appear twice
daily, morning and evening, to express submission
to the emperor in the public audience hall. They
shared the responsibility for guarding the emperor
and his household round the clock.
8.2 Information and empire
The keeping of exact and detailed records was a major
concern of the Mughal administration. The mir
bakhshi supervised the corps of court writers (waqia
nawis) who recorded all applications and documents
presented to the court, and all imperial orders
(farman). In addition, agents (wakil ) of nobles and
regional rulers recorded the entire proceedings of the
court under the heading “News from the Exalted
Court” (Akhbarat-i Darbar-i Mualla) with the date
and time of the court session (pahar). The akhbarat
contained all kinds of information such as attendance
at the court, grant of offices and titles, diplomatic
missions, presents received, or the enquiries made
by the emperor about the health of an officer. This
information is valuable for writing the history of the
public and private lives of kings and nobles.
News reports and important official documents
travelled across the length and breadth of the regions
under Mughal rule by imperial post. Round-the-clock
relays of foot-runners (qasid or pathmar ) carried
papers rolled up in bamboo containers. The emperor
received reports from even distant provincial capitals
within a few days. Agents of nobles posted outside
the capital and Rajput princes and tributary rulers
all assiduously copied these announcements and sent
their contents by messenger back to their masters.
The empire was connected by a surprisingly rapid
information loop for public news.

8.3 Beyond the centre: provincial
administration
The division of functions established at the centre
was replicated in the provinces (subas) where the
ministers had their corresponding subordinates
(diwan, bakhshi and sadr). The head of the provincial
administration was the governor (subadar) who
reported directly to the emperor.
The sarkars, into which each suba was divided,
often overlapped with the jurisdiction of faujdars
(commandants) who were deployed with contingents
of heavy cavalry and musketeers in districts. The
local administration was looked after at the level
of the pargana (sub-district) by three semi-hereditary
officers, the qanungo (keeper of revenue records),
the chaudhuri (in charge of revenue collection) and
the qazi.
Each department of administration maintained
a large support staff of clerks, accountants,
auditors, messengers, and other functionaries who
were technically qualified officials, functioning in
accordance with standardised rules and procedures,
and generating copious written orders and records.
Persian was made the language of administration
throughout, but local languages were used for
village accounts.
The Mughal chroniclers usually portrayed the
emperor and his court as controlling the entire
administrative apparatus down to the village level.
Yet, as you have seen (Chapter 8), this could hardly
have been a process free of tension. The relationship
between local landed magnates, the zamindars, and
the representatives of the Mughal emperor was
sometimes marked by conflicts over authority and a
share of the resources. The zamindars often succeeded
in mobilising peasant support against the state.

9. Beyond the Frontiers
Writers of chronicles list many high-sounding titles
assumed by the Mughal emperors. These included
general titles such as Shahenshah (King of Kings)
or specific titles assumed by individual kings
upon ascending the throne, such as Jahangir
(World-Seizer), or Shah Jahan (King of the World).
The chroniclers often drew on these titles and their
meanings to reiterate the claims of the Mughal
emperors to uncontested territorial and political
control. Yet the same contemporary histories
provide accounts of diplomatic relationships and
conflicts with neighbouring political powers.
These reflect some tension
and political rivalry arising
from competing regional
interests.
9.1 The Safavids and
Qandahar
The political and diplomatic
relations
between
Mughal kings and the
neighbouring countries of
Iran and Turan hinged on
the control of the frontier
defined by the Hindukush
mountains that separated
Afghanistan
regions of Iran and Central
Asia. All conquerors who
sought
their
Indian
subcontinent had to cross
the Hindukush to have
access to north India. A
constant aim of Mughal
policy was to ward off
potential
danger
by controlling strategic
outposts – notably Kabul
and Qandahar.
Qandahar was a bone of
contention
between
Safavids and the Mughals.
The fortress-town had initially

Humayun, reconquered in 1595 by Akbar. While the
Safavid court retained diplomatic relations with the
Mughals, it continued to stake claims to Qandahar. In
1613 Jahangir sent a diplomatic envoy to the court of
Shah Abbas to plead the Mughal case for retaining
Qandahar, but the mission failed. In the winter of 1622
a Persian army besieged Qandahar. The ill-prepared
Mughal garrison was defeated and had to surrender the
fortress and the city to the Safavids.
9.2 The Ottomans: pilgrimage and trade
The relationship between the Mughals and the
Ottomans was marked by the concern to ensure
free movement for merchants and pilgrims in the
territories under Ottoman control. This was
especially true for the Hijaz, that part of Ottoman
Arabia where the important pilgrim centres of Mecca
and Medina were located. The Mughal emperor
usually combined religion and commerce by
exporting valuable merchandise to Aden and Mokha,
both Red Sea ports, and distributing the proceeds

traditional costumes. The figure of the
Shah is based upon portraits made by
Bishandas who accompanied the Mughal
embassy to Iran in 1613. This gave a sense
of authenticity to a scene which is
fictional, as the two rulers had never met.

of the sales in charity to the keepers of shrines
and religious men there. However, when Aurangzeb
discovered cases of misappropriation of funds
sent to Arabia, he favoured their distribution in
India which, he thought, “was as much a house of
God as Mecca”.
9.3 Jesuits at the Mughal court
Europe received knowledge of India through the
accounts of Jesuit missionaries, travellers,
merchants and diplomats. The Jesuit accounts are
the earliest impressions of the Mughal court ever
recorded by European writers.
Following the discovery of a direct sea route
to India at the end of the fifteenth century,
Portuguese merchants established a network of
trading stations in coastal cities. The Portuguese
king was also interested in the propagation of
Christianity with the help of the missionaries of
the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). The Christian
missions to India during the sixteenth century were
part of this process of trade and empire building.
Akbar was curious about Christianity and
dispatched an embassy to Goa to invite Jesuit
priests. The first Jesuit mission reached the Mughal
court at Fatehpur Sikri in 1580 and stayed for about
two years. The Jesuits spoke to Akbar about
Christianity and debated its virtues with the ulama.
Two more missions were sent to the Mughal court
at Lahore, in 1591 and 1595.
The Jesuit accounts are based on personal
observation and shed light on the character and
mind of the emperor. At public assemblies the Jesuits
were assigned places in close proximity to Akbar’s
throne. They accompanied him on his campaigns,
tutored his children, and were often companions of
his leisure hours. The Jesuit accounts corroborate
the information given in Persian chronicles about
state officials and the general conditions of life in
Mughal times.

10. Questioning Formal
Religion
The high respect shown by Akbar towards
the members of the Jesuit mission
impressed them deeply. They interpreted
the emperor’s open interest in the
doctrines of Christianity as a sign of
his acceptance of their faith. This can
be understood in the light of the
prevailing climate of religious intolerance
in  Western Europe. Monserrate remarked
that “the king cared little that in allowing
everyone to follow his religion he was
in reality violating all”.
Akbar’s quest for religious knowledge
led to interfaith debates in the ibadat
khana at Fatehpur Sikri between learned
Muslims, Hindus, Jainas, Parsis and
Christians. Akbar’s religious views
matured as he queried scholars of
different religions and sects and gathered
knowledge about their doctrines.
Increasingly, he moved away from the
orthodox Islamic ways of understanding
religions towards a self-conceived eclectic
form of divine worship focused on light
and the sun. We have seen that Akbar
and Abu’l Fazl created a philosophy of
light and used it to shape the image of
the king and ideology of the state. In this,
a divinely inspired individual has
supreme sovereignty over his people and
complete control over his enemies.

Hom in the haram
This is an excerpt from Abdul Qadir Badauni’s Muntakhab-ut Tawarikh.
A theologian and a courtier, Badauni was critical of his employer’s policies
and did not wish to make the contents of his book public.
From early youth, in compliment to his wives, the daughters of
Rajas of Hind, His Majesty had been performing hom in the haram,
which is a ceremony derived from fire-worship (atish-parasti ). But
on the New Year of the twenty-fifth regnal year (1578) he
prostrated publicly before the sun and the fire. In the evening the
whole Court had to rise up respectfully when the lamps and candles
were lighted.

THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY – PART II
These ideas were in harmony with the perspective
of the court chroniclers who give us a sense of the
processes by which the Mughal rulers could
effectively assimilate such a heterogeneous populace
within an imperial edifice. The name of the dynasty
continued to enjoy legitimacy in the subcontinent
for a century and a half, even after its geographical
extent and the political control it exercised had
diminished considerably.
