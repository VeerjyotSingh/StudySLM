FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) – 2005 initiated a new phase of development
of syllabi and textbooks for all stages of school education. Conscious effort has been
made to discourage rote learning and to diffuse sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. This is well in tune with the NPE  – 1986 and Learning Without Burden-
1993 that recommend child centred system of education. The textbooks for Classes
IX and XI were released in 2006 and for Classes X and XII in 2007. Overall the books
have been well received by students and teachers.
NCF–2005 notes that treating the prescribed textbooks as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. It further reiterates that the methods used for teaching and evaluation will
also determine how effective these textbooks proves for making children’s life at school
a happy experience, rather than source of stress or boredom. It calls for reform in
examination system currently prevailing in the country.
The position papers of the National Focus Groups on Teaching of Science,
Teaching of Mathematics and Examination Reform envisage that the mathematics
question papers, set in annual examinations conducted by the various Boards do not
really assess genuine understanding of the subjects. The quality of questions papers is
often not up to the mark. They usually seek mere information based on rote memorisation,
and fail to test higher-order skills like reasoning and analysis, let along lateral thinking,
creativity, and judgment. Good unconventional questions, challenging problems and
experiment-based problems rarely find a place in question papers. In order to address
to the issue, and also to provide additional learning material, the Department of Education
in Science and Mathematics (DESM) has made an attempt to develop resource book
of exemplar problems in different subjects at secondary and higher-secondary stages.
Each resource book contains different types of questions of varying difficulty level.
Some questions would require the students to apply simultaneously understanding of
more than one chapters/units. These problems are not meant to serve merely as question
bank for examinations but are primarily meant to improve the quality of teaching/
learning process in schools. It is expected that these problems would encourage teachers
to design quality questions on their own. Students and teachers should always keep in
mind that examination and assessment should test comprehension, information recall,

analytical thinking and problem-solving ability, creativity and speculative ability.
A team of experts and teachers with an understanding of the subject and a
proper role of examination worked hard to accomplish this task. The material was
discussed, edited and finally included in this source book.
NCERT will welcome suggestions from students, teachers and parents which
would help us to further improve the quality of material in subsequent editions.

PREFACE
The Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM), National
Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), initiated the
development of ‘Exemplar Problems’ in science and mathematics for secondary
and higher secondary stages after completing the preparation of textbooks based
on National Curriculum Framework–2005.
The main objective of the book on ‘Exemplar Problems in Mathematics’ is to
provide the teachers and students a large number of quality problems with varying
cognitive levels to facilitate teaching learning of concepts in mathematics that are
presented through the textbook for Class XI. It is envisaged that the problems included
in this volume would help the teachers to design tasks to assess effectiveness of their
teaching and to know about the achievement of their students besides facilitating
preparation of balanced question papers for unit and terminal tests. The feedback
based on the analysis of students’ responses may help the teachers in further improving
the quality of classroom instructions. In addition, the problems given in this book are
also expected to help the teachers to perceive the basic characteristics of good quality
questions and motivate them to frame similar questions on their own. Students can
benefit themselves by attempting the exercises given in the book for self assessment
and also in mastering the basic techniques of problem solving. Some of the questions
given in the book are expected to challenge the understanding of the concepts of
mathematics of the students and their ability to applying them in novel situations.
The problems included in this book were prepared through a series of workshops
organised by the DESM for their development and refinement involving practicing
teachers, subject experts from universities and institutes of higher learning, and the
members of the mathematics group of the DESM whose names appear separately.
We gratefully acknowledge their efforts and thank them for their valuable contribution
in our endeavour to provide good quality instructional material for the school system.
I express my gratitude to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director and Professor
G.R.avindra, Joint Director, NCERT for their valuable motivation and guidiance from
time to time. Special thanks are also due to Dr. V.P. Singh, Reader in Mathematics,
DESM for coordinating the programme, taking pains in editing and refinement of problems
and for making the manuscript pressworthy.
We look forward to feedback from students, teachers and parents for further
improvement of the contents of this book.

1.1 Overview
This chapter deals with the concept of a set, operations on sets.Concept of sets will be
useful in studying the relations and functions.
1.1.1 Set and their representations A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
There are two methods of representing a set
Roaster or tabular form
Set builder form
1.1.2 The empty set  A set which does not contain any element is called the empty
set or the void set or null set and is denoted by { } or φ.
1.1.3 Finite and infinite sets  A set which consists of a finite number of elements is
called a finite set otherwise, the set is called an infinite set.
1.1.4 Subsets  A set A is said to be a subset of set B if every element of A is also an
element of B. In symbols we write A ⊂ B if a ∈ A ⇒ a ∈ B.
We denote
set of real numbers by R
set of natural numbers by N
set of integers by Z
set of rational numbers by Q
set of irrational numbers by T
We observe that
N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R,
T ⊂ R, Q ⊄ T, N ⊄ T
1.1.5 Equal sets  Given two sets A and B, if every elements of A is also an element of
B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to
be equal. The two equal sets will have exactly the same elements.
1.1.6 Intervals as subsets of R  Let a, b ∈ R and a < b. Then
An open interval denoted by (a, b) is the set of real numbers {x : a < x < b}
A closed interval denoted by [a, b] is the set of real numbers {x : a ≤ x ≤ b)
Chapter 1

2    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
Intervals closed at one end and open at the other are given by
[a, b) = {x : a ≤ x < b}
(a, b] = {x : a < x ≤ b}
1.1.7 Power set  The collection of all subsets of a set A is called the power set of A.
It is denoted by P(A). If the number of elements in A = n , i.e., n(A) = n,  then the
number of elements in P(A) = 2n.
1.1.8 Universal set  This is a basic set; in a particular context whose elements and
subsets are relevant to that particular context. For example, for the set of vowels in
English alphabet, the universal set can be the set of all alphabets in English. Universal
set is denoted by U.
1.1.9 Venn diagrams  Venn Diagrams are the
diagrams which represent the relationship between
sets. For example, the set of natural numbers is a
subset of set of whole numbers which is a subset of
integers. We can represent this relationship through
Venn diagram in the following way.
1.1.10 Operations on sets
Union of Sets : The union of any two given sets A and B is the set C which consists
of all those elements which are either in A or in B. In symbols, we write
C = A ∪ B = {x | x ∈A or x ∈B}
Fig 1.1
Fig 1.2 (a)
Fig 1.2 (b)
Some properties of the operation of union.
A ∪ B = B ∪ A
(A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)
(iii)
A ∪ φ = A
A ∪ A = A
U ∪ A = U
Intersection of sets: The intersection of two sets A and B is the set which
consists of all those elements which belong to both A and B. Symbolically, we
write A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.

SETS    3
When A ∩ B = φ, then A and B are called disjoint sets.
Fig 1.3 (a)
Fig 1.3 (b)
Some properties of the operation of intersection
A  ∩ B = B ∩ A
(A  ∩ B) ∩ C = A  ∩ (B ∩ C)
(iii)
φ ∩ A = φ ; U ∩ A = A
A ∩ A = A
A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
Difference of sets  The difference of two sets A and B, denoted by A – B is defined
as set of elements which belong to A but not to B. We write
A – B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B}
also,
B – A = { x : x ∈ B and x ∉A}
Complement of a set  Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the
complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A.
Symbolically, we write
A′ = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A}. Also A′ = U – A
Some properties of complement of sets
Law of complements:
A ∪ A′ = U
A ∩ A′ = φ
De Morgan’s law
(A  ∪ B)′ = A′  ∩ B′
(A  ∩ B)′ = A′  ∪ B′
(iii)
(A′ )′ = A
U′ = φ and φ′ = U
1.1.11 Formulae to solve practical problems on union and intersection of two sets
Let A, B and C be any finite sets. Then
n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B) – n (A ∩ B)
If (A ∩ B) = φ, then n (A ∪ B) = n (A) + n (B)

4    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
n (A ∪ B ∪ C) = n (A) +  n (B) + n (C) – n (A ∩ B) – n (A ∩ C) – n (B ∩ C)
+ n (A ∩ B ∩ C)
1.2 Solved Examples
Short Answer Type
Example 1  Write the following sets in the roaster form.
A = {x | x is a positive integer less than 10 and 2x – 1 is an odd number}
C = {x : x2 + 7x – 8 = 0, x ∈ R}
Solution
2x – 1 is always an odd number for all positive integral values of x. In particular,
2x – 1 is an odd number for x = 1, 2, ... , 9. Thus, A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
x2 + 7x – 8 = 0    or   (x + 8) (x – 1) = 0 giving x = – 8 or x = 1
Thus,   C = {– 8, 1}
Example 2 State which of the following statements are true and which are false.
Justify your answer.
37 ∉ {x | x has exactly two positive factors}
28 ∈ {y | the sum of the all positive factors of y is 2y}
(iii)
7,747 ∈ {t | t is a multiple of 37}
Solution
False
Since, 37 has exactly two positive factors, 1 and 37, 37 belongs to the set.
Since, the sum of positive factors of 28
= 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28
= 56 = 2(28)
(iii)
False
7,747 is not a multiple of 37.
Example 3  If X and Y are subsets of the universal set U, then show that
Y ⊂ X ∪ Y
X ∩ Y ⊂ X
(iii)
X ⊂ Y ⇒ X ∩ Y = X
Solution
X ∪ Y = {x | x ∈ X or x ∈ Y}
x ∈ Y ⇒ x ∈ X ∪ Y
Hence,
Y ⊂ X ∪ Y

SETS    5
X ∩ Y = {x | x ∈ X and x ∈ Y}
x ∈ X ∩ Y ⇒ x ∈ X
Hence
X ∩ Y ⊂ X
(iii)
Note that
x ∈ X ∩ Y ⇒ x ∈ X
X ∩ Y ⊂ X
Also, since
X ⊂ Y,
x ∈ X ⇒ x ∈ Y ⇒ x ∈ X ∩ Y
so that
X ⊂ X ∩ Y
Hence the result  X = X ∩ Y follows.
Example 4 Given that N = {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}, then
Write the subset A of N, whose element are odd numbers.
Write the subset B of N, whose element are represented by x + 2, where x ∈ N.
Solution
A = {x | x ∈ N and x is odd}= {1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 99}
B = {y | y = x + 2, x ∈ N}
So,  for
1 ∈ N,  y = 1 + 2 = 3
2 ∈ N,  y = 2 + 2 = 4,
and so on. Therefore, B = {3, 4, 5, 6, ... , 100}
Example 5 Given that E = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. If n represents any member of E, then,
write the following sets containing all numbers represented by
n + 1
Solution Given E = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
Let A = {x | x = n + 1, n ∈ E}
Thus,  for
2 ∈ E, x = 3
4 ∈ E, x = 5,
and so on. Therefore, A = {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}.
Let B = {x | x = n2, n ∈ E}
So,  for
2 ∈ E, x = (2)2 = 4, 4 ∈ E, x = (4)2 = 16, 6 ∈ E, x = (6)2 = 36,
and so on. Hence, B = {4, 16, 36, 64, 100}
Example 6 Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. If n represent any member of X, express the
following as sets:

6    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
n ∈ X but 2n ∉ X
n + 5 = 8
(iii)
n is greater than 4.
Solution
For X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, it is the given that n ∈ X, but 2n ∉ X.
A = {x | x ∈ X and 2x ∉ X}
1 ∉ A
2.1 = 2 ∈ X
2 ∉ A
2.2 = 4 ∈ X
3 ∉ A
2.3 = 6 ∈ X
4 ∈ A
2.4 = 8 ∉ X
5 ∈ A
2.5 = 10 ∉ X
6 ∈ A
2.6 = 12 ∉ X
A = {4, 5, 6}
Let B = {x | x ∈ X and x + 5 = 8}
Here,
B = {3}
as x = 3 ∈ X and 3 + 5 = 8 and there is no other element belonging to X
such that x + 5 = 8.
(iii)
Let C = {x | x ∈ X, x > 4}
Therefore,
C = {5, 6}
Example 7  Draw the Venn diagrams to illustrate the followoing relationship among
sets E, M and U, where E is the set of students studying English in a school, M is the
set of students studying Mathematics in the same school, U is the set of all students in
that school.
All the students who study Mathematics study English, but some students who
study English do not study Mathematics.
There is no student who studies both Mathematics and English.
(iii)
Some of the students study Mathematics but do not study English, some study English
but do not study Mathematics, and some study both.
Not all students study Mathematics, but every students
studying English studies Mathematics.
Solution
Since all of the students who study mathematics study
English, but some students who study English do not
study Mathematics.
Therefore,
M ⊂ E ⊂ U
Thus the Venn Diagram is
Fig 1.4

SETS    7
Since there is no student who study both English and Mathematics
Hence,
E ∩ M = φ.
Fig 1.5
Fig 1.6
Fig 1.7
(iii)
Since there are some students who study both English and Mathematics, some
English only and some Mathematics only.
Thus, the Venn Diagram is
Since every student studying English studiesMathematics.
Hence,
E ⊂ M ⊂ U
Example 8  For all sets A, B and C

8    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
Solution No. consider the following sets A, B and C :
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {2, 3, 5}
C = {4, 5, 6}
(A ∩ B) ∪ C = ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 5}) ∪ {4, 5, 6}
= {2, 3} ∪ {4, 5, 6}
= {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
A ∩ (B ∪ C) = {1, 2, 3} ∩ [{2, 3, 5} ∪ {4, 5, 6}
= {1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
= {2, 3}
Therefore,
(A ∩ B) ∪ C ≠A ∩ (B ∪ C)
Example 9 Use the properties of sets to prove that for all the sets A and B
A – (A ∩ B) = A – B
Solution We have
A – (A ∩ B) = A ∩ (A ∩ B)′     (since A – B = A ∩ B′)
= A ∩ (A′ ∪ B′)     [by De Morgan’s law)
= (A ∩ A′) ∪ (A ∩ B′) [by distributive law]
= φ ∪ (A ∩ B′)
= A ∩ B′ = A – B
Long Answer Type
Example  10  For all sets A, B and C
Is (A – B) ∩ (C – B) = (A ∩ C) – B?
Justify your answer.
Solution Yes
Let x ∈ (A – B) ∩ (C – B)
x ∈ A – B and x ∈ C – B
(x ∈ A and x ∉ B) and (x ∈ C and x ∉ B)
(x ∈ A and x ∈ C) and x ∉ B
(x ∈ A ∩ C) and x ∉ B
x ∈ (A ∩ C) – B
(A – B) ∩ (C – B) ⊂ (A ∩ C) – B
... (1)
Now, conversely

SETS    9
y ∈ (A ∩ C) – B
y ∈ (A ∩ C) and y ∉ B
(y ∈ A and y ∈ C) and (y ∉ B)
(y ∈ A and y ∉ B) and (y ∈ C and y ∉ B)
y ∈ (A – B) and y ∈ (C – B)
y ∈ (A – B) ∩ (C – B)
(A ∩ C) – B ⊂ (A – B) ∩ (C – B)
... (2)
From (1) and (2), (A – B) ∩ (C – B) =  (A ∩ C) – B
Example 11  Let A, B and C be sets. Then show that
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
Solution  We first show that A ∪ (B ∩ C) ⊂ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
Let x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C). Then
x ∈ A
x ∈ B ∩ C
x ∈ A
(x ∈ B and x ∈ C)
(x ∈ A or x ∈ B) and (x ∈ A or x ∈ C)
(x ∈ A ∪ B) and
(x ∈ A ∪ C)
x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
Thus,
A ∪ (B ∩ C) ⊂ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
... (1)
Now we will show that (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) ⊂ (A ∪ C)
x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
x ∈ A ∪ B and x ∈ A ∪ C
(x ∈ A or x ∈ B) and (x ∈ A or x ∈ C)
x ∈ A or (x ∈ B and x ∈ C)
x ∈ A or (x ∈ B ∩ C)
x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C)
Thus,
(A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C) ⊂ A ∪ (B ∩ C)
... (2)
So, from (1) and (2), we have
A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
Example 12  Let P be the set of prime numbers and let S = {t | 2t – 1 is a prime}.
Prove that S ⊂ P.
Solution  Now the equivalent contrapositive statement of x ∈ S ⇒ x ∈ P is x ∉ P ⇒
x ∉ S.

10    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
Now, we will prove the above contrapositive statement by contradiction method
x ∉ P
x is a composite number
Let us now assume that x ∈ S
2x – 1 = m
(where m is a prime number)
2x  = m + 1
Which is not true for all composite number, say for x = 4 because
24 = 16 which can not be equal to the sum of any prime number m and 1.
Thus, we arrive at a contradiction
x ∉ S.
Thus,
when x ∉ P, we arrive at x ∉ S
S ⊂ P.
Example 13  From 50 students taking examinations in Mathematics, Physics and
Chemistry, each of the student has passed in at least one of the subject, 37 passed
Mathematics, 24 Physics and 43 Chemistry. At most 19 passed Mathematics and
Physics, at most 29 Mathematics and Chemistry and at most 20 Physics and Chemistry.
What is the largest possible number that could have passed all three examination?
Solution  Let M be the set of students passing in Mathematics
P be the set of students passing in Physics
C be the set of students passing in Chemistry
n(M ∪ P ∪ C) = 50, n(M) = 37, n(P) = 24, n(C) = 43
n(M ∩ P) ≤ 19, n(M ∩ C) ≤ 29, n(P ∩ C) ≤ 20  (Given)
n(M ∪ P ∪ C) = n(M) + n(P) + n(C) – n(M ∩ P) – n(M ∩ C)
– n(P ∩ C) + n(M ∩ P ∩ C) ≤ 50
37 + 24 + 43 – 19 – 29 – 20 + n(M ∩ P ∩ C) ≤ 50
n(M ∩ P ∩ C) ≤ 50 – 36
n(M ∩ P ∩ C) ≤ 14
Thus, the largest possible number that could have passed all the three examinations is 14.

SETS    11
Example 14  Each set X r contains 5 elements and each set Yr contains 2 elements
. If each element of S belong to exactly 10 of the X r’s and to
exactly 4 of the Yr’s, then n is
Solution The correct answer is (B)
Since,
n(Xr) = 5,
, we get n(S) = 100
But each element of S belong to exactly 10 of the Xr’s
are the number of distinct elements in S.
Also each element of S belong to exactly 4 of the Yr’ s and each Yr contain 2 elements.
If S has n number of Yr in it. Then
n  = 10
which gives
n = 20
Example 15  Two finite sets have m and n elements respectively. The total number of
subsets of first set is 56 more than the total number of subsets of the second set. The
values of m and n respectively are.
Solution  The correct answer is (C).
Since, let A and B be such sets, i.e., n (A) = m,
n (B) = n
n (P(A)) = 2m, n (P(B)) = 2n
n (P(A)) – n (P(B)) = 56, i.e., 2m – 2n = 56
2n (2 m – n – 1) = 23 7

2.1 Overview
This chapter deals with linking pair of elements from two sets and then introduce
relations between the two elements in the pair. Practically in every day of our lives, we
pair the members of two sets of numbers. For example, each hour of the day is paired
with the local temperature reading by T.V. Station's weatherman, a teacher often pairs
each set of score with the number of students receiving that score to see more clearly
how well the class has understood the lesson. Finally, we shall learn about special
relations called functions.
2.1.1 Cartesian products of sets
Definition : Given two non-empty sets A and B, the set of all ordered pairs (x, y),
where x ∈ A and y ∈ B is called Cartesian product of A and B; symbolically, we write
A × B = {(x, y) |  x ∈ A and y ∈ B}
A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}, then
A × B = {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)}
B × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}
Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are
equal and the second elements are also equal, i.e. (x, y) = (u, v) if and only if x =
u, y = v.
If  n(A) = p and n (B) = q, then n (A × B) = p × q.
(iii)
A × A × A = {(a, b, c) : a, b, c ∈ A}. Here (a, b, c) is called an ordered triplet.
2.1.2 Relations  A Relation R from a non-empty set A to a non empty set B is a
subset of the Cartesian product set A × B. The subset is derived by describing a
relationship between the first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in
A × B.
The set of all first elements in a relation R, is called the domain of the relation R,
and the set of all second elements called images, is called the range of  R.
For example, the set R = {(1, 2), (– 2, 3), ( 1
2 , 3)} is a relation; the domain of
R = {1, – 2, 1
2 } and the range of R = {2, 3}.

A relation may be represented either by the Roster form or by the set builder
form, or by an arrow diagram which is a visual representation of a relation.
If n (A) = p, n (B) = q; then the n (A × B) = pq and the total number of possible
relations from the set A to set B = 2pq.
2.1.3 Functions  A relation f from a set A to a set B is said to be function if every
element of set A has one and only one image in set B.
In other words, a function f is a relation such that no two pairs in the relation
has the same first element.
The notation f : X → Y means that f is a function from X to Y. X is called the domain
of f and Y is called the co-domain of f. Given an element x ∈ X, there is a unique element
y in Y that is related to x. The unique element y to which f relates x is denoted by f (x) and
is called f of  x, or the value of  f at x, or the image of x under f.
The set of all values of  f (x)  taken together is called the range of f or image of X
under f. Symbolically.
range of  f = { y ∈ Y |  y = f (x), for some x in X}
Definition : A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range, is called
a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called
a real function.
2.1.4  Some specific types of functions
Identity function:
The function  f : R → R defined by y = f (x) = x for each x ∈ R is called the
identity function.
Domain of f = R
Range of f = R
Constant function: The function f : R → R defined by y = f (x) = C, x ∈ R,
where C is a constant ∈ R, is a constant function.
Domain of f = R
Range of f = {C}
(iii)
Polynomial function: A real valued function f : R → R defined by y = f (x) = a0
+ a1x + ...+ anxn, where n ∈ N, and a0, a1, a2...an ∈ R, for each x ∈ R, is called
Polynomial functions.
Rational function: These are the real functions of the type
, where
f (x) and g (x) are polynomial functions of x defined in a domain, where g(x) ≠ 0. For

rational function.
The Modulus function: The real function f : R → R defined by f (x) = x =
∀x ∈ R is called the modulus function.
Domain of  f = R
Range of  f = R+  ∪ {0}
Signum function: The real function
f : R → R defined by
is called the signum function. Domain of  f = R, Range of  f = {1, 0, – 1}
(vii)
Greatest integer function: The real function f : R → R defined by
f (x) = [x], x ∈R assumes the value of the greatest integer less than or equal to x, is
called the greatest integer function.
f (x) = [x] = – 1 for – 1 ≤ x  < 0
f (x) = [x] = 0  for  0 ≤ x  < 1
[x] = 1  for 1 ≤  x  <  2
[x] = 2  for 2 ≤  x  <  3 and so on
2.1.5  Algebra of real functions
Addition of two real functions
Let f : X → R and g : X → R be any two real functions, where X ∈ R.
Then we define ( f + g) : X → R by ( f + g) (x) = f (x) + g (x), for all x ∈ X.
Subtraction of a real function from another
Let f : X → R and g : X → R be any two real functions, where X ⊆ R.
Then, we define (f – g) : X → R by (f – g) (x) = f (x) – g (x), for all x ∈ X.
(iii)
Multiplication by a Scalar
Let  f : X → R be a real function and α be any scalar belonging to R. Then the

A × B

(iii)
Is A × B = B × A ?
Is n (A × B) = n (B × A) ?
Solution Since A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {5, 7, 9}. Therefore,
A × B = {(1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 7),
(2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9)}

(7, 3), (7, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)}

n (B × A) = n (B) × n (A) = 4 × 3 = 12
Hence

Example 2 Find x and y if:
(4x + 3, y) = (3x + 5, – 2)
(x – y, x + y) = (6, 10)
Solution
Since (4x + 3, y) = (3x + 5, – 2), so
4x + 3 = 3x + 5
x = 2
y = – 2
x – y = 6
x + y = 10
2x = 16
x = 8
8 – y = 6
y = 2
Example 3 If A = {2, 4, 6, 9} and B = {4, 6, 18, 27, 54}, a ∈ A, b ∈ B, find the set of
ordered pairs such that 'a' is factor of 'b' and a < b.
Solution Since
A = {2, 4, 6, 9}
B = {4, 6, 18, 27, 54},
we have to find a set of ordered pairs (a, b) such that a is factor of b and a < b.
Since 2 is a factor of 4 and 2 < 4.
So (2, 4) is one such ordered pair.
Similarly, (2, 6), (2, 18), (2, 54) are other such ordered pairs. Thus the required set
of ordered pairs is
{(2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 18), (2, 54), (6, 18), (6, 54,), (9, 18), (9, 27), (9, 54)}.
Example 4 Find the domain and range of the relation R given by
R = {(x, y) : y =

Solution When x = 1, y = 7 ∈ N, so (1, 7) ∈ R. Again for,

Example 5 Is the following relation a function? Justify your answer
R1 = {(2, 3), (
2 , 0), (2, 7), (– 4, 6)}
R2 = {(x, |x|) | x is a real number}
Solution
Since (2, 3) and (2, 7) ∈ R1
R1 (2) = 3     and     R1 (2) = 7
So R1 (2) does not have a unique image. Thus R1 is not a function.
(iii)
R2 = {(x, |x |) / x ∈R}
For every x ∈ R there will be unique image as |x| ∈ R.
Therefore R2 is a function.
Example 6 Find the domain for which the functions
f (x) = 2x2 – 1 and g (x) = 1 – 3x are equal.
Solution
f (x) = g (x)
2x2 – 1 = 1 – 3x
2x2 + 3x – 2 = 0
2x2 + 4x – x – 2 = 0
2x (x + 2) – 1 (x + 2) = 0
(2x – 1) (x + 2) = 0
Thus domain for which the function f (x) = g (x) is 1 ,–2

Now h (x) ≠ 0 ⇒ x2 + 3x + 2 ≠ 0 ⇒ (x + 1) (x + 2) ≠ 0 and hence domain of the
given function is R – {– 1, – 2}.
f (x) = [x] + x,i.e.,  f (x) = h (x) + g (x)
where
h (x) = [x] and g (x) = x

3.1 Overview
3.1.1 The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘trigon’ and ‘metron’
which means measuring the sides of a triangle. An angle is the amount of rotation of a
revolving line with respect to a fixed line. If the rotation is in clockwise direction the
angle is negative and it is positive if the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.
Usually we follow two types of conventions for measuring angles, i.e., (i) Sexagesimal
system (ii) Circular system.
In sexagesimal system, the unit of measurement is degree. If the rotation from the
initial to terminal side is 1 th
of a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of
1°. The classifications in this system are as follows:
1° = 60′
1′ = 60″
In circular system of measurement, the unit of measurement is radian. One radian is
the angle subtended, at the centre of a circle, by an arc equal in length to the radius of the
circle. The length s of an arc PQ of a circle of radius r is given by s = rθ, where θ is the
angle subtended by the arc PQ at the centre of the circle measured in terms of radians.
3.1.2  Relation between degree and radian
The circumference of a circle always bears a constant ratio to its diameter. This constant
ratio is a number denoted by π which is taken approximately as 22
7  for all practical
purpose. The relationship between degree and radian measurements is
as follows:
2 right angle = 180° = π radians
1 radian = 180°
π  = 57°16′ (approx)
1° = 180
π  radian = 0.01746 radians (approx)

Trigonometric ratios are defined for acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right
angled triangle. The extension of trigonometric ratios to any angle in terms of radian

Trigonometric functions of an angle of 18°
Let θ = 18°. Then 2θ = 90° – 3θ
Therefore,
sin 2θ = sin (90° – 3θ) = cos 3θ
sin 2θ = 4cos3 θ – 3cos θ
Since,
cos θ ≠0, we get
2sin θ = 4cos2 θ – 3 = 1 – 4sin2 θ     or     4sin2 θ + 2sin θ – 1 = 0.
Hence,
sin θ =
Since,
θ = 18°, sin θ > 0, therefore, sin 18° =
Also,
cos18° =
sin 18
Now, we can easily find cos 36° and sin 36° as follows:
cos 36° = 1 – 2sin2 18° =

unknown angles for which the functions are defined. The solutions of a trigonometric
equations for which 0 ≤ θ < 2 π are called principal solutions. The expression
involving integer n which gives all solutions of a trigonometric equation is called the
general solution.
General Solution of Trigonometric Equations
If sin θ = sin α for some angle α, then
θ = nπ + (–1)nα for n ∈ Z, gives general solution of the given equation
If cos θ = cos α for some angle α, then
θ = 2 nπ ± α, n ∈ Z, gives general solution of the given equation
(iii)
If tan θ = tan α or cot θ = cot α, then
θ = nπ + α, n ∈ Z, gives general solution for both equations
The general value of θ satisfying any of the equations sin2 θ = sin2 α, cos2θ =
cos2 α and
tan2 θ = tan2 α is given by θ = nπ ± α
The general value of θ satisfying equations sin θ = sin α and cos θ = cos α
simultaneously is given by θ = 2nπ + α, n ∈ Z.
To find the solution of an equation of the form a cosθ + b sinθ = c, we put
a = r cosα and b = r sinα, so that r2 = a2 + b2 and tan α = b
Thus we find
a cosθ + b sinθ = c changed into the form r (cos θ cos α + sin θ sin α) = c
r cos (θ – α) = c and hence cos (θ – α) = c
r . This gives the solution of  the given
equation.
Maximum and Minimum values of the expression  Acos θ + B sin θ are
respectively, where A and B are constants.

4.1 Overview
Mathematical induction is one of the techniques which can be used to prove variety
of mathematical statements which are formulated in terms of n, where n is a
positive integer.
4.1.1  The principle of mathematical induction
Let P(n) be a given statement involving the natural  number n such that
The statement is true for n = 1, i.e., P(1) is true (or true for any fixed natural
number) and
If the statement is true for n = k (where k is a particular but arbitrary natural
number), then the statement is also true for n = k + 1, i.e, truth of P(k) implies
the truth of P(k + 1). Then P(n) is true for all natural numbers n.

2.3 + 1 = 7 < 8 = 23
Assume that P(n) is true for some natural number k, i.e., 2k + 1 < 2k
To prove P(k + 1) is true, we have to show that 2(k + 1) + 1 < 2k+1. Now, we have
2(k + 1) + 1 = 2 k + 3
= 2k + 1 + 2 < 2k + 2 < 2k . 2 = 2k + 1.

Write the first four terms of the sequence.
Use the Principle of Mathematical Induction to show that the terms of the sequence

a2 = 5a2–1 = 5a1 = 5.2 = 10
a3 = 5a3–1 = 5a2 = 5.10 = 50
a4 = 5a4–1 = 5a3 = 5.50 = 250
Let P(n) be the statement, i.e.,

Example 7  The distributive law from algebra says that for all real numbers c, a1 and
a2, we have c (a1 + a2) = ca1 + ca2.
Use this law and mathematical induction to prove that, for all natural numbers, n ≥ 2,
if c, a1, a2, ...,an are any real numbers, then
c (a1 + a2 + ... + an) = ca1 + ca 2 + ... + ca n
Solution Let P(n) be the given statement, i.e.,
P(n) : c (a1 + a2 + ... + an) = ca 1 + ca2 + ... ca n for all natural numbers n ≥ 2, for c, a1,
a2, ... an ∈ R.
We observe that    P(2) is true since
c(a1 + a2) = ca1 + ca 2
(by distributive law)
Assume that P(n) is true for some natural number k, where k > 2, i.e.,
P(k) : c (a1 + a2 + ... + ak) = ca1 + ca 2 + ... + cak
Now to prove P(k + 1) is true, we have
P(k + 1) : c (a1 + a2 + ... + ak + ak + 1)
= c ((a1 + a2 + ... + ak) + ak + 1)
= c (a1 + a2 + ... + ak) + cak + 1
(by distributive law)
= ca1 + ca2 + ... + ca k + cak + 1
Thus P(k + 1) is true, whenever P (k) is true.
Hence, by the principle of Mathematical Induction, P(n) is true for all natural

Thus P (k + 1) is true whenever P (k) is true.
Hence, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction P(n) is true for all natural number n.
Example 9  Prove by the Principle of Mathematical Induction that
1 × 1! + 2 × 2! + 3 × 3! + ... + n × n! = (n + 1)! – 1 for all natural numbers n.
Solution  Let P(n) be the given statement, that is,
P(n) : 1 × 1! + 2 × 2! + 3 × 3! + ... + n × n! = (n + 1)! – 1 for all natural numbers n.
Note that P (1) is true, since
P (1) : 1 × 1! = 1 = 2 – 1 =  2!  – 1.
Assume that P(n) is true for some natural number k, i.e.,
P(k) : 1 × 1! + 2 × 2! + 3 × 3! + ... + k × k! = (k + 1)! – 1
To prove P (k + 1) is true, we have
P (k + 1) : 1 × 1! + 2 × 2! + 3 × 3! + ... + k × k! + (k + 1) × (k + 1)!
= (k + 1)! – 1 +  (k + 1)! × (k + 1)
= (k + 1 + 1)  (k + 1)! – 1
= (k + 2) (k + 1)! – 1 =  ((k + 2)!  – 1
Thus P (k + 1) is true, whenever P (k) is true. Therefore, by the Principle of Mathematical
Induction, P (n) is true for all natural number n.

Assume that P(k) is true for some natural number k, i.e.

So P(k + 1) is true, whenever P(k) is true in the case when k is odd.

for all natural numbers.

5.1 Overview
We know that the square of a real number is always non-negative e.g. (4)2 = 16 and
(– 4)2 = 16. Therefore, square root of 16 is ± 4. What about the square root of a
negative number? It is clear that a negative number can not have a real square root. So
we need to extend the system of real numbers to a system in which we can find out the
square roots of negative numbers. Euler (1707 - 1783) was the first mathematician to
introduce the symbol i (iota) for positive square root of – 1 i.e., i =
5.1.1  Imaginary numbers
Square root of a negative number is called an imaginary number., for example,

To compute in for n > 4, we divide n by 4 and write it in the form n = 4m + r, where m is
quotient and r is remainder (0 ≤ r ≤ 4)
Hence
in = i4m+r = (i4)m . (i)r = (1)m (i)r = ir
For example,
(i)39 = i 4 × 9 + 3 = (i4)9 . (i)3 = i3 = – i

5.1.3 Complex numbers
A number which can be written in the form a + ib, where a, b are real numbers
and i =
− is called a complex number.
If z = a + ib is the complex number, then a and b are called real and imaginary
parts, respectively, of the complex number and written as Re (z) = a, Im (z) = b.
Order relations “greater than” and “less than” are not defined for complex
numbers.
If the imaginary part of a complex number is zero, then the complex number is
known as purely real number and if real part is zero, then it is called
purely imaginary number, for example, 2 is a purely real number because its
imaginary part is zero and 3i is a purely imaginary number because its real part
is zero.
5.1.4 Algebra of complex numbers
Two complex numbers z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id are said to be equal if
a = c and b = d.
Let z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id be two complex numbers then
z1 + z2 = (a + c) + i (b + d).
5.1.5 Addition of complex numbers satisfies the following properties
As the sum of two complex numbers is again a complex number, the set of
complex numbers is closed with respect to addition.
Addition of complex numbers is commutative, i.e., z1 + z2 =  z2 + z1
Addition of complex numbers is associative, i.e., (z1 + z2) + z3 =  z1 + (z2 + z3)
For any complex number z = x + i y, there exist 0, i.e., (0 + 0i) complex number
such that z + 0 = 0 + z = z, known as identity element for addition.
For any complex number z = x + iy, there always exists a number – z = – a – ib
such that z + (– z) = (– z) + z = 0 and is known as the additive inverse of z.
5.1.6 Multiplication of complex numbers
Let z1 = a + ib and z2 = c + id, be two complex numbers. Then
z1 . z2 = (a + ib) (c + id) = (ac – bd) + i (ad + bc)
As the product of two complex numbers is a complex number, the set of complex
numbers is closed with respect to multiplication.
Multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, i.e., z1.z2 = z2.z1
Multiplication of complex numbers is associative, i.e., (z1.z2) . z3 = z1 . (z2.z3)

5.1.8 Conjugate of a complex number
Let z = a + ib be a complex number. Then a complex number obtained by changing the
sign of imaginary part of the complex number is called the conjugate of z and it is denoted
by z , i.e., z = a – ib.
Note that additive inverse of z is – a – ib but conjugate of z is a – ib.
We have :
z + z  = 2 Re (z) , z – z = 2 i Im(z)
z = z , if z is purely real.
z + z  = 0 ⇔  z is purely imaginary

A complex number z = a + ib can be represented by a unique point P (a, b) in the
cartesian plane referred to a pair of rectangular axes. The complex number 0 + 0i
represent the origin 0 ( 0, 0). A purely real number a,  i.e., (a + 0i) is represented by the
point (a, 0) on x - axis. Therefore,  x-axis is called real axis. A purely imaginary number

ib, i.e., (0 + ib) is represented by the point (0, b) on y-axis. Therefore, y-axis is called
imaginary axis.
Similarly, the representation of complex numbers as points in the plane is known as
Argand diagram. The plane representing complex numbers as points is called complex
plane or Argand plane or Gaussian plane.
If two complex numbers z1 and z2 be represented by the points P and Q in the complex
plane, then
z  = PQ
5.2.1 Polar form of a complex number
Let P be a point representing a non-zero complex number z = a + ib in the
Argand plane. If OP makes an angle θ with the positive direction of x-axis,
then z = r (cosθ + isinθ) is called the polar form of the complex number, where
r = z =
b  and tanθ = b
a . Here θ is called argument or amplitude of z and we
write it as arg (z) = θ.
The unique value of θ such that – π ≤ θ ≤ π is called the principal argument.
arg (z1 . z2) = arg (z1) + arg (z2)
= arg (z1) – arg (z2)
5.2.2  Solution of a quadratic equation
The equations ax 2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b and c are numbers (real or complex, a ≠ 0)
is called the general quadratic equation in variable x. The values of the variable satisfying
the given equation are called roots of the equation.
The quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 with real coefficients has two roots given
by – + D
, where D = b2 – 4ac, called the discriminant of  the equation.
$ Notes
When D = 0, roots of the quadratic equation are real and equal. When D > 0,
roots are real and unequal.
Further, if a, b, c ∈ Q and D is a perfect square, then the roots of the equation
are rational and unequal, and if a, b, c ∈Q and D is not a perfect square, then
the roots are irrational and occur in pair.

Multiplication of a non-zero complex number by i rotates it through a right

the complex plane.
(vii)
If n is a positive integer, then the value of in  + (i)n+1 + (i)n+2  +  (i)n+3 is 0.
Solution
True. Let z = 2 + 3i be complex number represented by OP. Then iz = –3 + 2i,
represented by OQ, where if OP is rotated in the anticlockwise direction through
a right angle, it coincides with OQ.
False.  Because cosθ + isinθ = 0 ⇒ cosθ = 0 and sinθ = 0. But there is no
value of θ for which cosθ and sinθ both are zero.
(iii)
False, because x + iy = x – iy ⇒ y = 0 ⇒ number lies on x-axis.
True, arg (z) = arg (1 + i
3 ) + arg (1 + i) + arg (cosθ + isinθ)
False, because
(x + 1)2 + y2 < (x – 1)2 + y2
which gives 4x < 0.
False, because if  z1, z2 and z 3 are in A.P., then
⇒ z2 is the midpoint
of z1 and z3, which implies that the points  z1, z2, z3 are collinear.
(vii)
True, because in + (i)n+1 + (i)n+2 + (i)n+3

6.1 Overview
6.1.1 A statement involving the symbols ‘>’, ‘<’, ‘ ≥’, ‘≤’ is called an inequality. For
example 5 > 3, x ≤ 4, x + y ≥ 9.
Inequalities which do not involve variables are called numerical inequalities. For
example 3 < 8, 5 ≥ 2.
Inequalities which involve variables are called literal inequalities. For example,
x > 3, y ≤ 5, x – y ≥ 0.
(iii)
An inequality may contain more than one variable and it can be linear, quadratic or
cubic etc. For eaxmple, 3x – 2 < 0 is a linear inequality in one variable, 2x + 3y ≥ 4
is a linear inequality in two variables and x2 + 3x + 2 < 0 is a quadratic inequality
in one variable.
Inequalities involving the symbol ‘>’ or ‘<’ are called strict inequalities. For
example, 3x – y > 5, x < 3.
Inequalities involving the symbol ‘≥’ or ‘≤’ are called slack inequalities. For
example, 3x – y ≥ 5, x ≤ 5.
6.1.2  Solution of an inequality
The value(s) of the variable(s) which makes the inequality a true statement is
called its solutions. The set of all solutions of an inequality is called the solution
set of the inequality. For example, x – 1 ≥ 0, has infinite number of solutions as
all real values greater than or equal to one make it a true statement. The inequality
x2 + 1 < 0 has no solution in R as no real value of x makes it a true statement.
To solve an inequality we can
Add (or subtract) the same quantity to (from) both sides without changing the
sign of inequality.
Multiply (or divide) both sides by the same positive quantity without changing the
sign of inequality. However, if both sides of inequality are multiplied (or divided)
by the same negative quantity the sign of inequality is reversed, i.e., ‘>’ changes
into ‘<’ and vice versa.
Chapter 6
LINEAR INEQUALITIES

6.1.3 Representation of solution of linear inequality in one variable on a
number line
To represent the solution of a linear inequality in one variable on a number line, we use
the following conventions:
If the inequality involves ‘≥’ or ‘≤’, we draw filled circle (•) on the number line
to indicate that the number corresponding to the filled circle is included in the
solution set.
If the inequality involves ‘>’ or ‘<’, we draw an open circle (O) on the number
line to indicate that the number corresponding to the open circle is excluded from
the solution set.
6.1.4  Graphical representation of the solution of a linear inequality
To represent the solution of a linear inequality in one or two variables graphically
in a plane, we proceed as follows:
If the inequality involves ‘≥’ or ‘≤’, we draw the graph of the line as a thick
line to indicate that the points on this line are included in the solution set.
If the inequality involves ‘>’ or ‘<’, we draw the graph of the line as dotted
line to indicate that the points on the line are excluded from the solution set.
Solution of a linear inequality in one variable can be represented on number line
as well as in the plane but the solution of a linear inequality in two variables of the
type ax + by > c, ax + by ≥ c, ax + by < c or ax + by ≤ c (a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0) can be
represented in the plane only.
Two or more inequalities taken together comprise a system of inequalities and
the solutions of the system of inequalities are the solutions common to all the
inequalities comprising the system.
6.1.5  Two important results
If a, b ∈ R and b ≠ 0, then
ab > 0 or  a
b  >  0 ⇒ a and b are of the same sign.
ab < 0 or  a
b  <  0 ⇒ a and b are of opposite sign.
If a is any positive real number, i.e., a > 0, then
| x| < a ⇔ – a < x < a
| x| ≤ a ⇔ – a ≤ x ≤ a
| x| > a  ⇔    x <  – a  or  x  >  a
| x| ≥  a  ⇔ x ≤  – a  or  x  ≥  a

(Subtracting x from both sides)
x < 6

(x ≤ 1 or  x ≥ 3)   and   (– 1 ≤  x ≤ 5)
x ∈  (– ∞, 1] ∪ [3, ∞)   and   x ∈ [ –1, 5]
Combining the solutions of two inequalities, we have
x ∈ [–1, 1] ∪ [3, 5]
Example 5  The cost and revenue functions of a product are given by
C(x) = 20 x + 4000 and R(x) = 60x + 2000, respectively, where x is the number of items
produced and sold. How many items must be sold to realise some profit?
Solution  We have,
profit = Revenue – Cost
= (60x + 2000) – (20x + 4000)
= 40x – 2000
To earn some profit, 40x – 2000 > 0
x > 50
Hence, the manufacturer must sell more than 50 items to realise some profit.
Example 6  Solve for x,
Solution On LHS of the given inequality, we have two terms both containing modulus.
By equating the expression within the modulus to zero, we get x = – 1, 0 as critical points.
These critical points divide  the real line in three parts as (– ∞, – 1), [–1, 0), [0, ∞).

Note that the common solution of (1) and (2) is null set. Hence, the given system of
inequalities has no solution.
Example 9  Find the linear inequalities for which the shaded region in the given figure
is the solution set.
Solution
Consider 2x + 3y = 3. We observe that
the shaded region and the origin lie on
opposite side of this line and (0, 0)
satisfies 2x + 3y ≤ 3. Therefore, we
must have 2x + 3y ≥ 3 as linear
inequality corresponding to the line
2x + 3y = 3.
Consider 3x + 4y = 18. We observe
that the shaded region and the origin
lie on the same side of this line and
(0, 0) satisfies 3x + 4y ≤ 18. Therefore,
3x + 4y ≤ 18 is the linear inequality
corresponding to the line 3x + 4y = 18.
(iii)
Consider –7x + 4y = 14. It is clear from the figure that the shaded region
and the origin lie on the same side of this line and (0, 0) satisfies the inequality
– 7x + 4y ≤ 14. Therefore, –7x + 4y ≤ 14 is the inequality corresponding to the
line –7x + 4y = 14.
Consider x – 6y = 3. It may be noted that the shaded portion and origin lie on the
same side of this line and (0, 0) satisfies x – 6y ≤ 3. Therefore, x – 6y ≤ 3 is the
inequality corresponding to the line x – 6y = 3.
Also the shaded region lies in the first quadrant only. Therefore, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0.
Hence, in view of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) above, the linear inequalities
corresponding to the given solution set are :
2x + 3y ≥ 3,3x + 4y ≤ 18 –7x + 4y ≤14, x – 6y ≤ 3, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0.

7.1 Overview
The study of permutations and combinations is concerned with determining the number
of different ways of arranging and selecting objects out of a given number of objects,
without actually listing them. There are some basic counting techniques which will be
useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging or selecting objects.
The two basic counting principles are given below:
Fundamental principle of counting
7.1.1  Multiplication principle (Fundamental Principle of Counting)
Suppose an event E can occur in m different ways and associated with each way of
occurring of E, another event F can occur in n different ways, then the total number of
occurrence of the two events in the given order is m × n .
7.1.2  Addition principle
If an event E can occur in m ways and another event F can occur in n ways, and
suppose that both can not occur together, then E or F can occur in m + n ways.
7.1.3  Permutations  A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a definite order.
7.1.4  Permutation of n different objects  The number of permutations of n objects
taken all at a time, denoted by the symbol nPn, is given by
... (1)
where n  = n(n – 1) (n – 2) ... 3.2.1, read as factorial n, or n factorial.
The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time, where 0 < r ≤ n,
denoted by nPr, is given by
nPr =
We assume that 0

7.1.5  When repetition of objects is allowed  The number of permutations of n things
taken all at a time, when repetion of objects is allowed is nn.
The number of permutations of n objects, taken r at a time, when repetition of
objects is allowed, is nr.
7.1.6  Permutations when the objects are not distinct   The number of permutations
of n objects of which p1 are of one kind, p2 are of second kind, ..., pk are of kth kind and
the rest if any, are of different kinds is
7.1.7  Combinations  On many occasions we are not interested in arranging but only
in selecting r objects from given n objects. A combination is a selection of some or all
of a number of different objects where the order of selection is immaterial. The number
of selections of r objects from the given n objects is denoted by nCr , and is given by
Remarks
Use permutations if a problem calls for the number of arrangements of objects
and different orders are to be counted.
Use combinations if a problem calls for the number of ways of selecting objects
and the order of selection is not to be counted.
7.1.8  Some important results
Let n and r be positive integers such that r ≤ n. Then
nCr = nCn – r
nCr + nCr – 1 = n + 1Cr
(iii)
n n – 1Cr – 1  = (n – r + 1) n Cr – 1

The first of these can be done in 27 ways and second can be performed in
14 ways. By the fundamental principle of counting, the required number of ways is
27 × 14 = 378.
Example 2
How many numbers are there between 99 and 1000 having 7  in the units place?
How many numbers are there between 99 and 1000 having atleast one of their
digits 7?
Solution
First note that all these numbers have three digits. 7 is in the unit’s place. The
middle digit can be any one of the 10 digits from 0 to 9. The digit in hundred’s
place can be any one of the 9 digits from 1 to 9. Therefore, by the fundamental
principle of counting, there are 10 × 9 = 90 numbers between 99 and 1000 having
7 in the unit’s place.
Total number of 3 digit numbers having atleast one of their digits as 7 = (Total
numbers of three digit numbers) – (Total number of 3 digit numbers in which 7
does not appear at all).
= (9 × 10 × 10) – (8 × 9 × 9)
= 900 – 648 = 252.
Example 3  In how many ways can this diagram be coloured subject to the following
two conditions?
Each of the smaller triangle is to be painted with one of three colours: red, blue or
green.
No two adjacent regions have the same colour.
Solution  These conditions are satisfied exactly when we do as follows: First paint the
central triangle in any one of the three colours. Next paint the remaining 3 triangles,
with any one of the remaining two colours.
By the fundamental principle of counting, this can be done in 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24 ways.

Example 4  In how many ways can 5 children be arranged in a line such that (i) two
particular children of them are always together (ii) two particular children of them are
never together.
Solution
We consider the arrangements by taking 2 particular children together as one
and hence the remaining 4 can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. Again two particular
children taken together can be arranged in two ways. Therefore, there are
24 × 2 = 48 total ways of arrangement.
Among the 5! = 120 permutations of 5 children, there are 48 in which two children
are together. In the remaining 120 – 48 = 72 permutations, two particular children
are never together.
Example 5  If all permutations of the letters of the word AGAIN are arranged in the
order as in a dictionary. What is the 49th word?
Solution  Starting with letter A, and arranging the other four letters, there are 4! = 24
words. These are the first 24 words. Then starting with G, and arranging A, A, I and N
in different ways, there are
2!1!1! =
words. Next the 37th word starts with I.
There are again 12 words starting with I. This accounts up to the 48th word.
The 49th word is NAAGI.
Example 6 In how many ways 3 mathematics books, 4 history books, 3 chemistry
books and 2 biology books can be arranged on a shelf so that all books of the same
subjects are together.
Solution  First we take books of a particular subject as one unit. Thus there are
4 units which can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. Now in each of arrangements,
mathematics books can be arranged in 3! ways, history books in 4! ways,
chemistry books in 3! ways and biology books in 2! ways. Thus the total number
of ways = 4! × 3! × 4! × 3! × 2! = 41472.
Example 7  A student has to answer 10 questions, choosing atleast 4 from each of
Parts A and B. If there are 6 questions in Part A and 7 in Part B, in how many ways
can the student choose 10 questions?
Solution  The possibilities are:
4 from Part A and 6 from Part B
5 from Part A and 5 from Part B
6 from Part A and 4 from Part B.

Solution  Let the men take their seats first. They can be seated in mPm ways as shown
in the following figure
From the above figure, we observe, that there are (m + 1) places for n women.
It is given that m > n and no two women can sit together. Therefore, n women can
take their seats (m + 1)Pn ways and hence the total number of ways so that no two
women sit together is
(mPm) × (m + 1Pn) =
Example 9  Three married couples are to be seated in a row having six seats in a
cinema hall. If spouses are to be seated next to each other, in how many ways can they
be seated? Find also the number of ways of their seating if all the ladies sit together.
Solution  Let us denote married couples by S 1, S2, S3,  where each couple is considered
to be a single unit as shown in the following figure:
Then the number of ways in which spouces can be seated next to each other is
3! = 6 ways.
Again each couple can be seated in 2! ways. Thus the total number of seating
arrangement so that spouces sit next to each other = 3! × 2! × 2! × 2! = 48.
Again, if three ladies sit together, then necessarily three men must sit together.
Thus, ladies and men can be arranged altogether among themselves in 2! ways.
Therefore, the total number of ways where ladies sit together is 3! × 3! × 2! = 144.

Example 10  In a small village, there are 87 families, of which 52 families have atmost
2 children. In a rural development programme 20 families are to be chosen for assistance,
of which atleast 18 families must have at most 2 children. In how many ways can the
choice be made?
Solution  It is given that out of 87 families, 52 families have at most 2 children so other
35 families are of other type. According to the question, for rural development
programme, 20 families are to be chosen for assistance, of which at least 18 families
must have atmost 2 children. Thus, the following are the number of possible choices:
52C18 × 35C2 (18 families having atmost 2 children and 2 selected from other type
of families)
52C19 × 35C1 (19 families having at most 2 children and 1 selected from other type
of families)
52C 20
(All selected 20 families having atmost 2 children)
Hence, the total number of possible choices is
52C18 × 35C2 + 52C19 × 35C1 + 52C20
Example 11  A boy has 3 library tickets and 8 books of his interest in the library. Of
these 8, he does not want to borrow Mathematics Part II, unless Mathematics Part I is
also borrowed. In how many ways can he choose the three books to be borrowed?
Solution  Let us make the following cases:
Case (i) Boy borrows Mathematics Part II, then he borrows Mathematics Part I also.
So the number of possible choices is 6C1 = 6.
Case (ii) Boy does not borrow Mathematics Part II, then the number of possible
choices is 7C3 = 35.
Hence, the total number of possible choices is 35 + 6 = 41.
Example 12  Find the number of permutations of n different things taken r at a time
such that two specific things occur together.
Solution  A bundle of 2 specific things can be put in r places in (r – 1) ways (Why?)
and 2 things in the bundle can be arranged themselves into 2  ways. Now (n – 2)
things will be arranged in (r – 2) places in n –2Pr –2 ways.

Objective Type Questions
Choose the correct answer out of four options given against each of the following
Examples (M.C.Q.).
Example 13  There are four bus routes between A and B; and three bus routes
between B and C. A man can travel round-trip in number of ways by bus from A to C
via B. If he does not want to use a bus route more than once, in how many ways can
he make round trip?
Solution  (A) is the correct answer. In the following figure:
there are 4 bus routes from A to B and 3 routes from B to C. Therefore, there are
4 × 3 = 12 ways to go from A to C. It is round trip so the man will travel back from C
to A via B. It is restricted that man can not use same bus routes from C to B and B to
A more than once. Thus, there are 2 × 3 = 6 routes for return journey. Therefore, the
required number of ways = 12 × 6 = 72.
Example 14  In how many ways a committee consisting of 3 men and 2 women, can
be chosen from 7 men and 5 women?
Solution  (B) is the correct choice. Out of 7 men, 3 men can be chosen in 7C 3
ways and out of 5 women, 2 women can be chosen in 5C 2 ways. Hence, the
committee can be chosen in 7C3 × 5C2 = 350 ways.
Example 15  All the letters of the word ‘EAMCOT’ are arranged in different possible
ways. The number of such arrangements in which no two vowels are adjacent to each
other is
Solution  (B) is the correct choice. We note that there are 3 consonants and 3
vowels E, A and O. Since no two vowels have to be together, the possible choice for
vowels are the places marked as ‘X’. X M X C X T X, these volwels can be arranged
in 4P3 ways 3 consonents can be arranged in 3 ways. Hence, the required number of
ways = 3! × 4P3 = 144.

Solution  (A) is correct choice. Number of 5 letters words (with the condition that a
letter can be repeated) = 105. Again number of words using 5 different letters is 10P5.
Therefore, required number of letters
= Total number of words – Total number of words in which no letter is repeated
= 105 –  10P5 = 69760.
Example 17  The number of signals that can be sent by 6 flags of different colours
taking one or more at a time is
Solution  The correct answer is B.
Number of signals using one flag = 6P1 = 6
Number of signals using two flags = 6P2 = 30
Number of signals using three flags = 6P3 = 120
Number of signals using four flags = 6P4 = 360
Number of signals using five flags = 6P5 = 720
Number of signals using all six flags = 6P6 = 720
Therefore, the total number of signals using one or more flags at a time is
6 + 30 + 120 + 360 + 720 + 720 = 1956 (Using addition principle).
Example 18  In an examination there are three multiple choice questions and each
question has 4 choices. Number of ways in which a student can fail to get all answer
correct is
Solution  The correct choice is (D). There are three multiple choice question, each
has four possible answers. Therefore, the total number of possible answers will be
4 × 4 × 4 = 64. Out of these possible answer only one will be correct and hence the
number of ways in which a student can fail to get correct answer is 64 – 1 = 63.
Example 19  The straight lines l1, l2 and l3 are parallel and lie in the same plane. A
total numbers of m points are taken on l1; n points on l2, k points on l3. The maximum
number of triangles formed with vertices at these points are
(m + n + k)C3
(m + n + k)C3 – mC3 – nC3 – kC3
mC3 + nC3 + kC3
mC3 × nC3 × kC3
Solution  (B) is the correct answer. Here the total number of points are (m + n + k)
which must give (m + n + k)C3 number of triangles but m points on l1 taking 3 points at a
time gives mC3 combinations which  produce no triangle. Similarly, nC3 and kC3

8.1 Overview:
8.1.1  An expression consisting of two terms, connected by + or – sign is called a
binomial expression. For example, x + a, 2x – 3y,
, etc., are all binomial
expressions.
8.1.2  Binomial theorem
If a and b are real numbers and n is a positive integer, then
(a + b)n =nC0 an + nC1 an – 1 b1 + nC2 an – 2 b2 + ...
... + nCr an – r br + ... + nCn bn, where nCr =
for 0 ≤ r ≤ n
The general term or (r + 1)th term in the expansion is given by
Tr + 1 = nCr an–r br
8.1.3  Some important observations
The total number of terms in the binomial expansion of (a + b)n is n + 1, i.e. one
more than the exponent n.
In the expansion, the first term is raised to the power of the binomial and in each
subsequent terms the power of a reduces by one with simultaneous increase in
the power of b by one, till power of b becomes equal to the power of binomial,
i.e., the power of a is n in the first term, (n – 1) in the second term and so on
ending with zero in the last term. At the same time power of b is 0 in the first
term, 1 in the second term and 2 in the third term and so on, ending with n in the
last term.
In any term the sum of the indices (exponents) of ‘a’ and ‘b’ is equal to n (i.e.,
the power of the binomial).
The coefficients in the expansion follow a certain pattern known as pascal’s
triangle.

Index of Binomial
Coefficient of various terms
Each coefficient of any row is obtained by adding two coefficients in the preceding
row, one on the immediate left and the other on the immediate right and each row is
bounded by 1 on both sides.
The (r + 1)th term or general term is given by
Tr + 1 =
nCr an – r br
8.1.4  Some particular cases
If n is a positive integer, then
(a + b)n = nC0 an b0 + nC1 an b1 + nC2 an – 2  b2 + ... + nCr an – r br + ... +
nCn a0 bn
... (1)
In particular
Replacing b by – b in (i), we get
(a – b)n = nC0 an b0 – nC1 an – 1 b1 + nC2 an – 2 b2 + ... + (–1)r nCr an – r br + ... +
(–1)n nCn a0 bn
... (2)
Adding (1) and (2), we get
(a + b)n + (a – b)n = 2 [nC0 an b0 + nC2 an – 2 b2 + nC4 an – 4 b4 + ... ]
= 2 [terms at odd places]
Subtracting (2) from (1), we get
(a + b)n – (a – b)n = 2 [nC1 an – 1 b1 + nC3 an – 3 b3 + ... ]
= 2 [sum of terms at even places]
Replacing a by 1 and b by x in (1), we get

BINOMIAL THEOREM    131

(1 – x)n = nC0 x0 – nC1 x + nC2 x2  ... + nCn–1  (–1)n–1 xn-1  + nCn  (–1)n  xn
i.e.,
(1 – x)n =
8.1.5 The pth term from the end
The pth  term from the end in the expansion of (a + b)n is (n – p + 2)th term from the
beginning.
8.1.6  Middle terms
The middle term depends upon the value of n.
If n is even: then the total number of terms in the expansion of (a + b)n is n + 1
(odd). Hence, there is only one middle term, i.e.,
term is the middle
term.
If n is odd: then the total number of terms in the expansion of (a + b)n is n + 1
(even). So there are two middle terms i.e.,
are two
middle terms.
8.1.7  Binomial coefficient
In the Binomial expression, we have
(a + b)n =nC0 an + nC1 an – 1 b + nC2 an – 2 b2 + ... + nCn bn
... (1)
The coefficients nC0, nC1, nC2, ... , nCn are known as binomial or combinatorial
coefficients.
Putting a = b = 1 in (1), we get
nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + ... + nCn = 2n
Thus the sum of all the binomial coefficients is equal to 2n.
Again, putting a = 1 and b = –1 in (i), we get
nC0 + nC2 + nC4 + ... = nC1 + nC3 + nC5 + ...
Thus, the sum of all the odd binomial coefficients is equal to the sum of all the even
binomial coefficients and each is equal to
nC0 + nC2 + nC4 + ... = nC1 + nC3 + nC5 + ... = 2n – 1

9.1 Overview
By a sequence, we mean an arrangement of numbers in a definite order according
to some rule. We denote the terms of a sequence by a1, a2, a3, ... , etc., the subscript
denotes the position of the term.
In view of the above a sequence in the set X can be regarded as a mapping or a
function f : N → X defined by
f (n) = tn ∀ n ∈ N.
Domain of f is a set of natural numbers or some subset of it denoting the position of
term. If its range denoting the value of terms is a subset of R real numbers then it is
called a real sequence.
A sequence is either finite or infinite depending upon the number of terms in a sequence.
We should not expect that its terms will be necessarily given by a specific formula.
However, we expect a theoretical scheme or rule for generating the terms.
Let a1, a2, a3, ... , be the sequence, then, the expression a1 + a2 + a3 + ... is called the
series associated with given sequence. The series is finite or infinite according as the
given sequence is finite or infinite.
Remark  When the series is used, it refers to the indicated sum not to the sum itself.
Sequence following certain patterns are more often called progressions. In
progressions, we note that each term except the first progresses in a definite manner.
9.1.1   Arithmetic progression (A.P.) is a sequence in which each term except the
first is obtained by adding a fixed number (positive or negative) to the preceding term.
Thus any sequence a1, a2, a3 ... an, ... is called an arithmetic progression if
an + 1= an + d, n ∈ N, where d is called the common difference of the A.P., usually we
denote the first term of an A.P by a and the last term by l
The general term or the nth term of the A.P. is given by
a + (n – 1) d
The nth term from the last is given by
l – (n – 1) d

9.1.2 A Geometric progression (G.P.)  is a sequence in which each term except the

Example 4  At the end of each year the value of a certain machine has depreciated by
20% of its value at the beginning of that year. If its initial value was Rs 1250, find the
value at the end of 5 years.
Solution After each year the value of the machine is 80% of its value the previous
year so at the end of 5 years the machine will depreciate as many times as 5.
Hence, we have to find the 6th term of the G.P. whose first term a1 is 1250 and common
ratio r is .8.
Hence, value at the end 5 years = t6 = a1 r5 = 1250 (.8)5 = 409.6
Example 5 Find the sum of first 24 terms of the A.P. a1, a2, a3, ... if it is known that
a1 + a5 + a10 + a15 + a20 + a24 = 225.
Solution  We know that in an A.P., the sum of the terms equidistant from the beginning
and end is always the same and is equal to the sum of first and last term.
Therefore
d = b – a
i.e.,
a1 + a24 = a5 + a20 = a10 + a15
It is given that (a1 + a24) + (a5 + a20) + (a10 + a15) = 225
⇒ (a1 + a24) + (a1 + a24) + (a1 + a24) =225
3 (a1 + a24) = 225
a1 + a24 = 75
We know that S n =

Thus,

SEQUENCE AND SERIES    153
(a – d) a (a + d) = 224
a (a2 – d2) = 224

Now, since the largest number is 7 times the smallest, i.e., a + d = 7 (a – d)
Therefore,
d = 3
Substituting this value of d in (1), we get
⎠ = 224
a = 8
d = 3
Hence, the three numbers are 2, 8, 14.
Example 7  Show that (x2 + xy + y2), (z2 + xz + x2) and (y2 + yz + z2) are consecutive
terms of an A.P., if x, y and z are in A.P.
Solution The terms (x2 + xy + y2), (z2 + xz + x2) and (y2 + yz + z2) will be in A.P. if
(z2 + xz + x2) – (x2 + xy + y2) = (y2 + yz + z2) – (z2 + xz + x2)
i.e.,
z2 + xz – xy – y2  = y2 + yz – xz – x2
i.e.,
x2 + z2 + 2xz – y2  = y2 + yz + xy
i.e.,
(x + z)2 – y2  = y (x + y + z)
i.e.,
x + z – y = y
i.e.,
x + z = 2y
which is true, since x, y, z are in A.P. Hence x2 + xy + y2, z2 + xz + x2, y2 + yz + z2 are
in A.P.

Example 13  Find the natural number a for which
= 16(2n – 1), where
the function f satisfies f (x + y) = f (x) . f (y) for all natural numbers x, y and further
f (1) = 2.
Solution Given that
f (x + y) = f (x) . f (y) and f (1) = 2
Therefore,
f (2) = f (1 + 1) =  f (1) . f (1) = 22
f (3) = f (1 + 2) =  f (1) . f (2) = 23
f (4) = f (1 + 3) =  f (1) . f (3) = 24
and so on. Continuing the process, we obtain
f (k) = 2k and f (a) = 2a
Hence
= f (a)
= 2a (21 + 22 + 23 + ... + 2n)
... (1)
But, we are given
f a k
= 16 (2n – 1)
2a + 1 (2n – 1) = 16 (2n – 1)
2a+1 = 24  ⇒  a + 1 = 4

10.1 Overview
10.1.1  Slope of a line
If θ is the angle made by a line with positive direction of x-axis in anticlockwise direction,
then the value of tan θ is called the slope of the line and is denoted by m.
The slope of a line passing through points P(x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) is given by
10.1.2  Angle between two lines  The angle θ between the two lines having slopes m1 and
m2 is given by
If we take the acute angle between two lines, then tan θ =
If the lines are parallel, then m1 = m2.
If the lines are perpendicular, then m1m2 = – 1.
10.1.3  Collinearity of three points  If three points P (h, k), Q (x1, y1) and R (x2,y2)
are such that slope of PQ = slope of QR, i.e.,
(h – x1) (y2 – y1) = (k – y1) (x2 – x1) then they are said to be collinear.
10.1.4  Various forms of the equation of a line
If a line is at a distance a and parallel to x-axis, then the equation of the line is
y = ± a.
If a line is parallel to y-axis at a distance b from y-axis then its equation is
x = ± b

Slope intercept form : The equation of the line making an intercept c on  y-axis and
having slope m is given by
y = mx + c
Note that the value of c will be positive or negative as the intercept is made on
the positive or negative side of the y-axis, respectively.

passing through the origin and therefore has zero intercepts on the axes.

Normal Form : The normal form of the equation Ax + By + C = 0 is
x cos ω+ y sin ω = p where,
ω = ±

Example 3  Prove that every straight line has an equation of the form Ax + By + C = 0,
where A, B and C are constants.
Proof  Given a straight line, either it cuts the y-axis, or is parallel to or coincident with
it. We know that the equation of a line which cuts the y-axis (i.e., it has y-intercept) can
be put in the form y = mx + b; further, if the line is parallel to or coincident with the y-
axis, its equation is of the form x = x1, where x = 0 in the case of coincidence. Both of
these equations are of the form given in the problem and hence the proof.
Example 4  Find the equation of the straight line passing through (1, 2) and perpendicular
to the line x + y + 7 = 0.
Solution  Let m be the slope of the line whose equation is to be found out which is
perpendicular to the line x + y + 7 = 0. The slope of the given line y = (– 1) x – 7 is – 1.
Therefore, using the condition of perpendicularity of lines, we have m × (– 1) = – 1
or m = 1 (Why?)
Hence, the required equation of the line is y – 1 = (1) (x – 2) or y – 1 = x – 2 ⇒ x –
y – 1 = 0.
Example 5  Find the distance between the lines 3x + 4y = 9 and 6x + 8y = 15.
Solution  The equations of lines 3x + 4y = 9 and 6x + 8y = 15 may be rewritten as
3x + 4y – 9 = 0       and       3x + 4y
Since, the slope of these lines are same and hence they are parallel to each other.
Therefore, the distance between them is given by
Example 6  Show that the locus of the mid-point of the distance between the axes of

(D) y – x – 2 = 0.
Solution  (B) is the correct answer. Let the slope of the line be m. Then, its equation
passing through (1, 2) is given by

Therefore, we have

Solution  (A) is the correct choice. Let the line make intercept ‘a’ on x-axis. Then, it
makes intercept ‘2a’ on y-axis. Therefore, the equation of the line is given by

11.1.1 Sections of a cone  Let l be a fixed vertical line and m be another line intersecting
it at a fixed point V and inclined to it at an angle α (Fig. 11.1).
Fig. 11.1
Suppose we rotate the line m around the line l in such a way that the angle α remains
constant.  Then the surface generated is a double-napped right circular hollow cone
herein after referred as cone and extending indefinitely in both directions (Fig. 11.2).

The point V is called the vertex; the line l is the axis of the cone. The rotating line m is
called a generator of the cone.  The vertex separates the cone into two parts called
nappes.
If we take the intersection of a plane with a cone, the section so obtained is called a
conic section. Thus, conic sections are the curves obtained by intersecting a right
circular cone by a plane.
We obtain different kinds of conic sections depending on the position of the intersecting
plane with respect to the cone and the angle made by it with the vertical axis of the
cone. Let β be the angle made by the intersecting plane with the vertical axis of the
cone (Fig.11.3).
The intersection of the plane with the cone can take place either at the vertex of the
cone or at any other part of the nappe either below or above the vertex.
When the plane cuts the nappe (other than the vertex) of the cone, we have the
following situations:
When β = 90o,  the section is a circle.
When α < β <  90o, the section is an ellipse.
When β = α; the section is a parabola.
(In each of the above three situations, the plane cuts entirely across one nappe
of the cone).
When 0 ≤ β < α; the plane cuts through both the nappes and the curves of
intersection is a hyperbola.
Indeed these curves are important tools for present day exploration of outer space and
also for research into the behaviour of atomic particles.
We take conic sections as plane curves. For this purpose, it is convenient to use equivalent
definition that refer only to the plane in which the curve lies, and refer to special points
and lines in this plane called foci and directrices. According to this approach, parabola,
ellipse and hyperbola are defined in terms of a fixed point (called focus) and fixed line
(called directrix) in the plane.
If S is the focus and l is the directrix, then the set of all points in the plane whose
distance from S bears a constant ratio e called eccentricity to their distance from l is a
conic section.
As special case of ellipse, we obtain circle for which e = 0 and hence we study it
differently.
11.1.2  Circle  A circle is the set of all points in a plane which are at a fixed distance
from a fixed point in the plane. The fixed point is called the centre of the circle and the
distance from centre to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle.

Example 1  Find the centre and radius of the circle x2 + y2 – 2x + 4y = 8
Solution we write the given equation in the form (x2 – 2x) + ( y2 + 4y) = 8
Now, completing the squares, we get
(x2 – 2x + 1) + ( y2 + 4y + 4) = 8 + 1 + 4
(x – 1)2 + (y + 2)2 = 13
Comparing it with the standard form of the equation of the circle, we see that the
centre of the circle is (1, –2) and radius is 13 .
Example 2  If the equation of the parabola is x2 = – 8y, find coordinates of the focus,
the equation of the directrix and length of latus rectum.
Solution The given equation is of the form x2 = – 4ay where a is positive.
Therefore, the focus is on y-axis in the negative direction and parabola opens downwards.

Example 3 Given the ellipse with equation 9x2 + 25y2 = 225, find the major and minor
axes, eccentricity, foci and vertices.
Solution We put the equation in standard form by dividing by 225 and get
This shows that a = 5 and b = 3. Hence 9 = 25(1 – e2), so e =
5 . Since the denominator
of x2 is larger, the major axis is along x-axis, minor axis along y-axis, foci are (4, 0) and

Example 7  Find the equation of the circle which passes through the points (20, 3),
(19, 8) and (2, –9). Find its centre and radius.
Solution By substitution of coordinates in the general equation of the  circle given by

38g + 16 f + c =

Hence, the equation of the circle is
x2 + y2 – 14x – 6y – 111 =
(x – 7)2 + (y – 3)2 =
Therefore, the centre of the circle is (7, 3) and radius is 13.

Each of the examples from 11 to 16, has four possible options, out of which one is
correct. Choose the correct answer from the given four options (M.C.Q.)
Example 11  The equation of the circle in the first quadrant touching each coordinate
axis at a distance of one unit from the origin is:
x2 + y2 – 2x – 2y + 1= 0
x2 + y2 – 2x – 2y – 1 = 0
x2 + y2  – 2x – 2y = 0
x2 + y2 – 2x + 2y – 1 = 0
Solution The correct choice is (A), since the equation can be written as (x – 1)2 +
(y – 1)2 = 1 which represents a circle touching both the axes with its centre (1, 1) and
radius one unit.
Example 12  The equation of the circle having centre (1, –2) and passing through the

x2 + y2 + 2x – 4y – 20 = 0
x2 + y2 + 2x + 4y – 20 = 0

12.1.1 Coordinate axes and coordinate planes   Let X′OX, Y′OY, Z′OZ be three
mutually perpendicular lines that pass through a point O such that X′OX and Y′OY lies
in the plane of the paper and  line Z′OZ is perpendicular to the plane of paper. These
three lines are called rectangular axes ( lines X′OX, Y′OY and Z′OZ are called x-axis,
y-axis and z-axis). We call this coordinate system
a three dimensional space, or simply space.
The three axes taken together in pairs determine
xy, yz, zx-plane , i.e., three coordinate planes. Each
plane divide the space in two parts and the three
coordinate planes together divide the space into
eight regions (parts) called octant, namely (i)  OXYZ

(vi) OX′YZ′ (vii) OX′Y′Z (viii) OX′Y′Z′.

Let P be any point in the space, not in a coordinate
plane, and through P pass planes parallel to the
coordinate planes yz, zx and xy meeting the
coordinate axes in the points A, B, C respectively.

the plane through P parallel to the yz-plane intersects the x-axis at (x0, 0, 0);
the plane through P parallel to the xz-plane intersects the y-axis at (0, y0, 0);
the plane through P parallel to the xy-plane intersects the z-axis at (0, 0, z0).
The space coordinates (x0, y0, z0) are called the Cartesian coordinates of P or simply
the rectangular coordinates of P.
Moreover we can say,  the plane ADPF
( Fig.12.2) is perpendicular to the x-axis or x-
axis is perpendicular to the plane ADPF and
hence perpendicular to every line in the plane.
Therefore, PA is perpendicular to OX and OX
is perpendicular to PA. Thus A is the foot of
perpendicular drawn from P on x-axis and
distance of this foot A from O is x-coordinate
of  point  P.  Similarly, we call  B and C are the
feet of perpendiculars drawn from point P on
the y and z-axis and distances of these feet B
and C from O are the y and z coordinates of
the point P.
Hence the coordinates x, y z of a point P are the perpendicular distance of P from the
three coordinate planes yz, zx and xy, respectively.
12.1.3 Sign of coordinates of a point  The distance measured along or parallel to OX,
OY, OZ will be positive and distance moved along or parallel to OX′, OY′, OZ′  will be
negative. The three mutually perpendicular coordinate plane which in turn divide the
space into eight parts and each part is know as octant. The sign of the coordinates of
a point depend upon the octant in which it lies. In first octant all the coordinates are
positive and in seventh octant all coordinates are negative. In third octant x, y coordinates
are negative and z is positive. In fifth octant x, y are positive and z is negative. In fourth
octant x, z are positive and y is negative. In sixth octant x, z are negative y is positive.
In the second octant x is negative and y and z are positive.

Example 3  Let L, M, N be the feet of the perpendiculars drawn from a point P (3, 4, 5)
on the x, y and z-axes respectively. Find the coordinates of L, M and N.
Solution  Since L is the foot of perpendicular from P on the x-axis,  its y and z co-
ordinates are zero. The coordinates of L is (3, 0, 0). Similarly, the coordinates of M and
N are (0, 4, 0) and (0, 0, 5), respectively.
Example 4  Let L, M, N be the feet of the
perpendicular segments drawn from a point
P (3, 4, 5) on the xy, yz and zx-planes, respectively.
What are the coordinates of L, M and N?
Solution  Since L is the foot of perpendicular
segment from P on the xy-plane,  z-coordinate is
zero in the xy-plane. Hence, coordinates of  L is
(3, 4, 0). Similarly, we can find the coordinates of
of M (0, 4, 5) and N (3, 0, 5), Fig.12.6.
Example 5  Let L, M, N are the feet of the
perpendiculars drawn from the point P (3, 4, 5) on
the xy, yz and zx-planes, respectively. Find the
distance of these points  L, M, N from the
point P, Fig.12.7.
Solution  L is the foot of perpendicular drawn
from the point P (3, 4, 5) to the xy-plane.
Therefore, the coordinate of the point L is
(3, 4, 0). The distance between the point (3, 4,
5) and (3, 4, 0) is 5.  Similarly, we can find the
lengths of the foot of perpendiculars on yz and
zx-plane which are 3 and 4 units, respectively.
Example 6  Using distance formula show  that
the points P (2, 4, 6), Q (– 2, – 2, – 2) and

Example 7 Find the coordinates of a point equidistant from the four points O (0, 0, 0),
A (l, 0, 0), B (0, m, 0) and C (0, 0, n).
Solution  Let P (x, y, z) be the required point. Then OP = PA = PB = PC.
Now OP = PA ⇒OP2 = PA2  ⇒ x2 + y2 + z2 = (x – l)2 + (y  – 0)2 + (z – 0)2  ⇒ x  = 2
Similarly, OP = PB ⇒ y = 2
m  and OP = PC ⇒ z = 2
Hence, the coordinate of the required point are ( 2
l , 2
m , 2
Example 8 Find the point on x-axis which is equidistant from the point A (3, 2, 2) and
B (5, 5, 4).
Solution  The point on the x-axis is of  form P (x, 0, 0). Since the points A and B are
equidistant from P. Therefore PA2 = PB2, i.e.,
(x – 3)2 + ( 0 – 2)2 + (0 – 2)2 = (x – 5)2 + (0 – 5)2 + (0 – 4)2
⇒ 4x = 25 + 25 + 16 – 17 i.e., x =
Thus, the point P on the x - axis is (
4 , 0, 0) which is equidistant from A and B.
Example 9  Find the point on y-axis which is at a distance 10  from the point (1, 2, 3)
Solution  Let the point P be on y-axis. Therefore, it is of the form P (0, y, 0).
The point (1, 2, 3) is at a distance 10  from (0, y, 0). Therefore
(1 0)
⇒ y2 – 4y + 4 = 0  ⇒ (y – 2)2 = 0 ⇒ y = 2
Hence, the required point is (0, 2, 0).

Example 13  Find the ratio in which the line segment joining the points (2, 4, 5) and

Solution  Let the joint of P (2, 4, 5) and Q (3, 5, – 4) be divided by xz-plane in the ratio
k:1 at the point R(x, y, z). Therefore
Since the point R (x, y, z) lies on the xz-plane, the y-coordinate should be zero,i.e.,
= 0 ⇒ k =
Hence, the required ratio is – 4 : 5, i.e.; externally in the ratio 4 : 5.

(2, 0 3)  B (0, 3, 2) and C (0, 0, 1).
Solution  Since x-coordinate of every point in yz-plane is zero. Let P (0, y, z) be a point
on the yz-plane such that PA = PB = PC. Now
PA = PB ⇒ (0 – 2)2 + (y – 0)2 + (z – 3)2 = (0 – 0)2 + (y – 3)2 + (z – 2)2 , i.e. z – 3y = 0

13.1 Overview
13.1.1  Limits of a function
Let f be a function defined in a domain which we take to be an interval, say, I. We shall
study the concept of limit of f at a point ‘a’ in I.
We say
a f x
is the expected value of f at x = a given the values of f near to the
left of a. This value is called the left hand limit of f at a.
We say lim
a f x
is the expected value of f at x = a given the values of f near to the
right of a. This value is called the right hand limit of f at a.
If the right and left hand limits coincide, we call the common value as the limit of f  at
x = a and denote it by lim
a f x
Some properties of limits
Let f and g be two functions such that both lim
a f x
and lim ( )
a g x
exist. Then

f ′(x) =
... (1)
is called the derivative of  f  at x, provided the limit on the R.H.S. of (1) exists.
Algebra of derivative of functions  Since the very definition of derivatives involve
limits in a rather direct fashion, we expect the rules of derivatives to follow closely that
of limits as given below:
Let f and g be two functions such that their derivatives are defined in a common
domain. Then :
Derivative of the sum of two function is the sum of the derivatives of the functions.

14.1 Overview
If an object is either black or white, and if it is not black, then logic leads us to the
conclusion that it must be white. Observe that logical reasoning from the given hypotheses
can not reveal what “black” or “white” mean, or why an object can not be both.
Infact, logic is the study of general patterns of reasoning, without reference to particular
meaning or context.
14.1.1  Statements
A statement is a sentence which is either true or false, but not both simultaneously.
Note:  No sentence can be called a statement if
It is an exclamation
It is an order or request
(iii)
It is a question
It involves variable time such as ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’, ‘yesterday’ etc.
It involves variable places such as ‘here’, ‘there’, ‘everywhere’ etc.
It involves pronouns such as ‘she’, ‘he’, ‘they’ etc.
Example 1
The sentence
‘New Delhi is in India; is true. So it is a statement.
The sentence
“Every rectangle is a square” is false. So it is a statement.
(iii)
The sentence
“Close the door” can not be assigned true or false (Infact, it is a command). So
it can not be called a statement.
The sentence
Chapter 14
MATHEMATICAL REASONING
“How old are you?” can not be assigned true or false (In fact, it is a question).
So it is not a statement.
The truth or falsity of the sentence
“x is a natural number” depends on the value of x. So it is not considered as a
statement. However, in some books it is called an open statement.
Note: Truth and falisity of a statement is called its truth value.
14.1.2  Simple statements A statement is called simple if it can not be broken down
into two or more statements.
Example 2  The statements
“2 is an even number”,
“A square has all its sides equal” and
“ Chandigarh is the capital of Haryana” are all simple statements.
14.1.3  Compound statements  A compound statement is the one which is made up of
two or more simple statements.
Example 3 The statement
“11 is both an odd and prime number” can be broken into two statements
“11 is an odd number” and “11 is a prime number” so it is a compound statement.
Note: The simple statements which constitutes a compound statement are called
component statements.
14.1.4 Basic logical connectives  There are many ways of combining simple
statements to form new statements. The words which combine or change simple
statements to form new statements or compound statements are called Connectives.
The basic connectives (logical) conjunction corresponds to the English word ‘and’;
disjunction corresponds to the word ‘or’; and negation corresponds to the word
‘not’.
Throughout we use the symbol ‘∧’ to denote conjunction; ‘∨’ to denote disjunction and
the symbol ‘~’ to denote negation.
Note: Negation is called a connective although it does not combine two or more
statements. In fact, it only modifies a statement.
14.1.5  Conjunction  If two simple statements p and q are connected by the word
‘and’, then the resulting compound statement “p and q” is called a conjunction of p
and q and is written in symbolic form as “p ∧ q”.
MATHEMATICAL REASONING    247
248    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
Example 4  Form the conjunction of the following simple statements:
Dinesh is a boy.
Nagma is a girl.
Solution  The conjunction of the statement p and q is given by
p ∧ q :
Dinesh is a boy and Nagma is a girl.
Example 5  Translate the following statement into symbolic form
“Jack and Jill went up the hill.”
Solution  The given statement can be rewritten as
“Jack went up the hill and Jill went up the hill”
Let p : Jack went up the hill   and   q : Jill went up the hill.
Then the given statement in symbolic form is p ∧ q.
Regarding the truth value of the conjunction p ∧ q of two simple statements p and q,
we have
(D1) :
The statement p ∧ q has the truth value T (true) whenever both p and q
have the truth value T.
(D2) :
The statement p ∧ q has the truth value F (false) whenever either p or q
or both have the truth value F.
Example 6  Write the truth value of each of the following four statements:
Delhi is in India and 2 + 3 = 6.
Delhi is in India and 2 + 3 = 5.
(iii)
Delhi is in Nepal and 2 + 3 = 5.
Delhi is in Nepal and 2 + 3 = 6.
Solution  In view of (D1) and (D2) above, we observe that statement (i) has the truth
value F as the truth value of the statement “2 + 3 = 6” is F. Also, statement (ii) has the
truth value T as both the statement “Delhi is in India” and “2 + 3 = 5” has the truth
value T.
Similarly, the truth value of both the statements (iii) and (iv) is F.
14.1.6  Disjunction  If two simple statements p and q are connected by the word
‘or’, then the resulting compound statement “p or q” is called disjunction of p and q
and is written in symbolic form as “p ∨ q”.
Example 7  Form the disjunction of the following simple statements:
The sun shines.
It rains.
MATHEMATICAL REASONING    249
Solution  The disjunction of the statements p and q is given by
p ∨ q :
The sun shines or it rains.
Regarding the truth value of the disjunction p ∨ q of two simple statements p and q, we
(D3) :
The statement p ∨ q has the truth value F whenever both p and q have
the truth value F.
(D4) :
The statement p ∨ q has the truth value T whenever either p or q or both
have the truth value T.
Example 8  Write the truth value of each of the following statements:
India is in Asia or 2 + 2 = 4.
India is in Asia or 2 + 2 = 5.
(iii)
India is in Europe or 2 + 2 = 4.
India is in Europe or 2 + 2 = 5.
Solution In view of (D3) and (D4) above, we observe that only the last statement has
the truth value F as both the sub-statements “India is in Europe” and “2 + 2 = 5” have
the truth value F. The remaining statements (i) to (iii) have the truth value T as at least
one of the sub-statements of these statements has the truth value T.
14.1.7 Negation  An assertion that a statement fails or denial of a statement is called
the negation of the statement. The negation of a statement is generally formed by
introducing the word “not” at some proper place in the statement or by prefixing the
statement with “It is not the case that” or It is false that”.
The negation of a statement p in symbolic form is written as “~ p”.
Example 9  Write the negation of the statement
p : New Delhi is a city.
Solution  The negation of  p is given by
~ p : New Delhi is not a city
~ p : It is not the case that New Delhi is a city.
~ p : It is false that New Delhi is a city.
Regarding the truth value of the negation ~ p of a statement p, we have
(D5) :
~ p has truth value T whenever  p has truth value F.
(D6) :
~ p has truth value F whenever p has truth value T.

Example 10  Write the truth value of the negation of each of the following statements:
p : Every square is a rectangle.
q : The earth is a star.
(iii)
r : 2 + 3 < 4
Solution  In view of (D5) and (D6), we observe that the truth value of ~p is F as the truth
value of p is T. Similarly, the truth value of both ~q and ~r is T as the truth value of both
statements q and r is F.
14.1.8  Negation of compound statements
14.1.9  Negation of conjunction Recall that a conjunction p ∧ q consists of two
component statements  p and q both of which exist simultaneously. Therefore, the
negation of the conjunction would mean the negation of at least one of the two component
statements. Thus, we have
(D7) :
The negation of a conjunction p ∧ q is the disjunction of the negation of
p and the negation of q. Equivalently, we write
~ (p ∧ q) =  ~ p  ∨ ~ q
Example 11 Write the negation of each of the following conjunctions:
Paris is in France and London is in England.
2 + 3 = 5 and 8 < 10.
Solution
Write p : Paris is in France and q : London is in England.
Then, the conjunction in (a) is given by p ∧ q.
~ p : Paris is not in France, and
~ q : London is not in England.
Therefore, using (D7), negation of  p ∧ q is given by
~ ( p ∧ q) = Paris is not in France or London is not in England.
Write p : 2 + 3 = 5 and q : 8 < 10.
Then the conjunction in (b) is given by p ∧ q.
Now ~ p : 2 + 3 ≠ 5 and ~ q : 8 </ 10.
Then, using (D7), negation of p ∧ q is given by
– ( p ∧ q) = (2 + 3 ≠ 5 ) or (8 </ 10)
MATHEMATICAL REASONING    251
14.1.10  Negation of disjunction  Recall that a disjunction p ∨ q is consisting of two
component statements p and q which are such that either p or q or both exist. Therefore,
the negation of the disjunction would mean the negation of both p and q simultaneously.
Thus, in symbolic form, we have
(D8) : The negation of a disjunction p ∨ q is the conjunction of the negation of  p
and the negation of q. Equivalently, we write
~ (p ∨ q) =  ~  p ∧ ∼ q
Example 12  Write the negation of each of the following disjunction :
Ram is in Class X or Rahim is in Class XII.
7 is greater than 4 or 6 is less than 7.
Solution
p    : Ram is in Class X and q : Rahim is in Class XII.
Then the disjunction in (a) is given by p ∨ q.
~ p :
Ram is not in Class X.
~ q  :
Rahim is not in Class XII.
Then, using (D8), negation of  p ∨ q is given by
~ (p ∨ q) : Ram is not in Class X and Rahim is not in Class XII.
Write p : 7 is greater than 4, and q : 6 is less than 7.
Then, using (D8), negation of p ∨ q is given by
~ (p ∨ q) : 7 is not greater than 4 and 6 is not less than 7.
14.1.11  Negation of a negation As already remarked the negation is not a connective
but a modifier. It only modifies a given statement and applies only to a single simple
statement. Therefore, in view of (D5) and (D6), for a statement p, we have
(D9) : Negation of negation of a statement is the statement itself. Equivalently, we
write
~ ( ~ p) = p
14.1.12  The conditional statement  Recall that if p and q are any two statements,
then the compound statement “if p then q” formed by joining p and q by a connective
‘if then’ is called a conditional statement or an implication and is written in symbolic
form as p → q or p ⇒ q. Here, p is called hypothesis (or antecedent) and q is called
conclusion (or consequent) of the conditional statement (p ⇒ q):
Remark The conditional statement p ⇒ q can be expressed in several different ways.
Some of the common expressions are :
252    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
if p, then q
q if p
p only if q
p is sufficient for q
q is necessary for p.
Observe that the conditional statement p → q reflects the idea that whenever it is
known that p is true, it will have to follow that q is also true.
Example 13  Each of the following statements is also a conditional statement.
If 2 + 2 = 5, then Rekha will get an ice-cream.
If you eat your dinner, then you will get dessert.
(iii)
If John works hard, then it will rain today.
If ABC is a triangle, then ∠ A + ∠ B + ∠ C = 180°.
Example 14  Express in English, the statement p → q, where
p : it is raining today
q : 2 + 3 > 4
Solution  The required conditional statement is
“If it is raining today, then 2 + 3 > 4”
14.1.13 Contrapositive of a conditional statement The statement “(~ q) → (~ p)” is
called the contrapositive of the statement  p → q
Example 15  Write each of the following statements in its equivalent contrapositive
form:
If my car is in the repair shop, then I cannot go to the market.
If Karim cannot swim to the fort, then he cannot swim across the river.
Solution  (i) Let “p : my car is in the repair shop” and “q : I can not go to the market”.
Then, the given statement in symbolic form is p → q. Therefore, its contrapositive is
given by ~ q → ~ p.
Now ~ p : My car is not in the repair shop.
~ q : I can go to the market
Therefore, the contrapositive of the given statement is
“If I can go to the market, then my car is not in the repair shop”.
Proceeding on the lines of the solution of (i), the contrapositive of the statement
in (ii) is
“If Karim can swim across the river, then he can swim to the fort”.
MATHEMATICAL REASONING    253
14.1.14  Converse of a conditional statement  The conditional statement “q → p” is
called the converse of the conditional statement  “ p → q ”
Example 16  Write the converse of the following statements
If x < y, then x + 5 < y + 5
If ABC is an equilateral triangle, then ABC is an isosceles triangle
Solution (i) Let
p : x < y
q : x + 5 < y + 5
Therefore, the converse of the statement p → q is given by
“If x + 5 < y + 5, then x < y
Converse of the given statement is
“If ABC is an isosceles triangle, then ABC is an equilateral triangle.”
14.1.15 The biconditional statement  If two statements p and q are connected by
the connective ‘if and only if’ then the resulting compound statement “p if and only if q”
is called a biconditional of p and q and is written in symbolic form as  p ↔ q.
Example 17  Form the biconditional of the following statements:
p : One is less than seven
q : Two is less than eight
Solution  The biconditional of p and q is given by “One is less than seven, if and only
if two is less than eight”.
Example 18  Translate the following biconditional into symbolic form:
“ABC is an equilateral triangle if and only if it is equiangular”.
Solution  Let p : ABC is an equilateral triangle
q : ABC is an equiangular triangle.
Then, the given statement in symbolic form is given by  p ↔ q.
14.1.16  Quantifiers  Quantifieres are the phrases like ‘These exist’ and “for every”.
We come across many mathematical statement containing these phrases.
For example – Consider the following statements
p : For every prime number x,
x  is an irrational number.
q : There exists a triangle whose all sides are equal.
254    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
14.1.17  Validity of statements Validity of a statement means checking when the
statement is true and when it is not true. This depends upon which of the connectives,
quantifiers and implication is being used in the statement.
Validity of statement with ‘AND’
To show statement r : p ∧ q is true, show statement ‘p’ is true and statement ‘q’
is true.
Validity of statement with ‘OR’
To show statement r : p ∨ q is true, show either statement ‘p’ is true or statement
‘q’ is true.
(iii)
Validity of statement with “If-then”
To show statement r : “If p then q is true”, we can adopt the following methods:
(a) Direct method : Assume p is true and show q is true, i.e., p ⇒ q.
(b) Contrapositive method : Assume ~ q is true and show ~ p is true, i.e.,
~ q ⇒ ~ p.
(c) Contradiction method : Assume that p is true and q is false and obtain a
contradiction from assumption.
(d) By giving a counter example : To prove the given statement r is false we
give a counter example. Consider the follwoing statement.
“r : All prime numbers are odd”. Now the statement ‘r’ is false as 2 is a
prime number and it is an even number.
14.1.18 Validity of the statement with “If and only If”  To show the statement
r : p if and only if q is true, we proceed as follows:
Step 1 Show if p is true then q is true.
Step 2 Show if q is true then p is true.

truth value F as the first component statement namely “every rectangle is a square” is
false.
Further, in statements (i), (ii) and (v) atleast one component statement is true. Therefore,
these statements have truth value T.
Also, truth value of statement (iii) is T as both the component statements are true.
Example 5  Write negation of the statement

MATHEMATICAL REASONING    257
~ p : Threre exists a triangle which is not an equilateral triangles.
~ p : Not all triangles are equilateral triangles
~ q : 9 is not a multiple of 4.
~ r : It is false that the triangle has four sides.
~ r : A triangle has not four sides.
Example 7  Write the negation of the following statements :
Suresh lives in Bhopal or he lives in Mumbai.
x + y = y + x and 29 is a prime number.
Solution
p : Suresh lives in Bhopal
q : Suresh lives in Mumbai
Then the disjunction in (i) is given by p ∨ q.
~ p : Suresh does not live in Bhopal.
~ q : Suresh does not live in Mumbai.
Therefore, using (D8), negation of  p ∨ q is given by
~ ( p ∨ q ) : Suresh does not live in Bhopal and he does not live in Mumbai.
Let  p : x + y = y + x
q : 29 is a prime number.
Then the conjunction in (ii) is given by p ∧ q.
Now  ~ p : x + y ≠ y + x
~ q : 29 is not a prime number.
Therefore, using (D7), negation of  p ∧ q is given by,
~ ( p ∧ q) : x + y  ≠  y + x or 29 is not a prime number.

15.1 Overview
In earlier classes, you have studied measures of central tendency such as mean, mode,
median of ungrouped and grouped data. In addition to these measures, we often need
to calculate a second type of measure called a measure of dispersion  which meas-
ures the variation in the observations about the middle value– mean or median etc.
This chapter is concerned with some important measures of dispersion such as
mean deviation, variance, standard deviation etc., and finally analysis of frequency
distributions.
15.1.1  Measures of dispersion
RangeThe measure of dispersion which is easiest to understand and easiest to
calculate is the range. Range is defined as:
Range = Largest observation – Smallest observation
Mean Deviation
(i) Mean deviation for ungrouped data:
For n observation x1, x2, ..., xn, the mean deviation about their mean x  is
given by
M.D ( x ) =
Mean deviation about their median M is given by
M.D (M) =
(ii) Mean deviation for discrete frequency distribution

frequencies f1, f2, ... , fn, respectively. In this case

and median of the distribution.
Variance : Let x1, x2, ..., xn be n observations with x as the mean. The variance,
denoted by σ2, is given by
Standard Deviation: If σ2 is the variance, then σ, is called the standard deviation,

expressing the standard deviation as a proportion of mean, usually a percentage. The

16.1 Overview
Probability is defined as a quantitative measure of uncertainty – a numerical value that
conveys the strength of our belief in the occurrence of an event. The probability of an
event is always a number between 0 and 1 both 0 and 1 inclusive. If an event’s probability
is nearer to 1, the higher is the likelihood that the event will occur; the closer the event’s
probability to 0, the smaller is the likelihood that the event will occur. If the event
cannot occur, its probability is 0. If it must occur (i.e., its occurrence is certain), its
probability is 1.
16.1.1  Random experiment  An experiment is random means that the experiment
has more than one possible outcome and it is not possible to predict with certainty
which outcome that will be. For instance, in an experiment of  tossing an ordinary coin,
it can be predicted with certainty that the coin will land either heads up or tails up, but
it is not known for sure whether heads or tails will occur. If a die is thrown once, any of
the six numbers, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 may turn up, not sure which number will come up.
Outcome  A possible result of a random experiment is called its outcome for
example if the experiment consists of tossing a coin twice, some of the outcomes
are HH, HT etc.
Sample Space  A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an
experiment. In fact, it is the universal set S pertinent to a given experiment.
The sample space for the experiment of tossing a coin twice is given by
S =  {HH, HT, TH, TT}
The sample space for the experiment of drawing a card out of a deck is the set of all
cards in the deck.
16.1.2  Event  An event is a subset of a sample space S. For example, the event of
drawing an ace from a deck is
A = {Ace of Heart, Ace of Club, Ace of Diamond, Ace of Spade}
16.1.3  Types of events
Impossible and Sure Events The empty set φ and the sample space S describe
events. In fact φ is called an impossible event and S, i.e., the whole sample
space is called a sure event.
Chapter 16
PROBABILITY
(ii) Simple or Elementary Event If an event E has only one sample point of a
sample space, i.e., a single outcome of an experiment, it is called a simple or
elementary event. The sample space of the experiment of tossing two coins is
given by
S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
The event E1 = {HH} containing a single outcome HH of the sample space S is
a simple or elementary event. If one card is drawn from a well shuffled deck,
any particular card drawn like ‘queen of Hearts’ is an elementary event.
(iii) Compound Event  If an event has more than one sample point it is called a
compound event, for example, S = {HH, HT} is a compound event.
(iv) Complementary event  Given an event A, the complement of A is the event
consisting of all sample space outcomes that do not correspond to the occurrence
of A.
The complement of A is denoted by A′ or A . It is also called the event ‘not A’. Further
P( A) denotes the probability that A will not occur.
A′ = A = S – A = {w : w ∈ S and w ∉A}
16.1.4  Event ‘A or B’  If A and B are two events associated with same sample space,
then the event ‘A or B’ is same as the event A ∪ B and contains all those elements
which are either in A or in B or in both. Further more, P (A∪B) denotes the probability
that A or B (or both) will occur.
16.1.5  Event ‘A and  B’   If A and B are two events associated with a sample space,
then the event ‘A and B’ is same as the event A ∩ B and contains all those elements which
are common to both A and B. Further more, P (A ∩ B) denotes the probability that both
A and B will simultaneously occur.
16.1.6  The Event ‘A but not B’ (Difference A – B)  An event A – B is the set of all
those elements of the same space S which are in A but not in B, i.e., A – B = A ∩ B′.
16.1.7  Mutually exclusive  Two events A and B of a sample space S are mutually
exclusive if the occurrence of any one of them excludes the occurrence of the other
event. Hence, the two events A and B cannot occur simultaneously, and thus P(A∩B) = 0.
Remark  Simple or elementary events of a sample space are always mutually exclusive.
For example, the elementary events {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5} or {6} of the experiment of
throwing a dice are mutually exclusive.
Consider the experiment of throwing a die once.
The events E = getting a even number and  F = getting an odd number are mutually
exclusive events because E ∩ F = φ.
PROBABILITY    285
286    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
Note For a given sample space, there may be two or more mutually exclusive events.
16.1.8  Exhaustive events  If E 1, E2, ..., En are n events of a sample space S and if
E1 ∪ E2 ∪ E3 ∪ ... ∪ En =
then E1, E2, ..., En are called exhaustive events.
In other words, events E1, E2, ..., En of a sample space S are said to be exhaustive if
atleast one of them necessarily occur whenever the experiment is performed.
Consider the example of rolling a die. We have S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Define the two
events
A : ‘a number less than or equal to 4 appears.’
B : ‘a number greater than or equal to 4 appears.’
A : {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {4, 5, 6}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = S
Such events A and B are called exhaustive events.
16.1.9  Mutually exclusive and exhaustive events  If E1, E2, ..., En are n events of
a sample space S and if Ei ∩ Ej = φ for every i ≠  j, i.e., Ei and Ej are pairwise disjoint
, then the events E1, E2, ... , En are called mutually exclusive and exhaustive
events.
Consider the example of rolling a die.
We have
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Let us define the three events as
A = a number which is a perfect square
B = a prime number
C = a number which is greater than or equal to 6
Now A = {1, 4},
B = {2, 3, 5}, C = {6}
Note that A  ∪ B  ∪ C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = S. Therefore, A, B and C are exhaustive
events.
Also A ∩ B = B ∩ C = C ∩ A = φ
Hence, the events are pairwise disjoint and thus mutually exclusive.
Classical approach is useful, when all the outcomes of the experiment are equally
likely. We can use logic to assign probabilities. To understand the classical method
consider the experiment of tossing a fair coin. Here, there are two equally likely
PROBABILITY    287
outcomes - head (H) and tail (T). When the elementary outcomes are taken as equally
likely, we have a uniform probablity model. If there are k elementary outcomes in S,
each is assigned the probability of 1
k . Therefore, logic suggests that the probability of
observing a head, denoted by P (H), is 1
2 = 0.5, and that the probability of observing a
tail,denoted P (T), is also 1
2 = 5. Notice that each probability is between 0 and 1.
Further H and T are all the outcomes of the experiment and P (H) + P (T) = 1.
16.1.10  Classical definition If all of the outcomes of a sample space are equally
likely, then the probability that an event will occur is equal to the ratio :
The number of outcomes favourable to the event
The total number of outcomes of the sample space
Suppose that an event E can happen in h ways out of a total of n possible equally likely
ways.
Then the classical probability of occurrence of the event is denoted by
P (E) =
The probability of non occurrence of the event E is denoted by
P (not E) =
1 P(E)
P (E) + P (not E) = 1
The event ‘not E’ is denoted by E or E′ (complement of E)
Therefore
P ( E ) = 1 – P (E)
16.1.11  Axiomatic approach to probability  Let S be the sample space of a random
experiment. The probability P is a real valued function whose domain is the power set
of S, i.e., P (S) and range is the interval [0, 1] i.e. P : P (S) → [0, 1] satisfying the
following axioms.
For any event E, P (E) ≥ 0.
P (S) = 1
(iii)
If E and F are mutually exclusive events, then P (E ∪ F) = P (E) + P (F).
288    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
It follows from (iii) that P ( φ ) = 0.
Let S be a sample space containing elementary outcomes w1, w2, ..., wn,
i.e., S = {w1, w2, ..., wn}
It follows from the axiomatic definition of probability that
0 ≤ P (wi) ≤ 1 for each wi ∈ S
P (wi) + P (w2) + ... + P (wn) = 1
(iii)
P (A) =
for any event A containing elementary events wi.
For example, if a fair coin is tossed once
P (H) = P (T) = 1
2 satisfies the three axioms of probability.
Now suppose the coin is not fair and has double the chances of falling heads up as
compared to the tails, then P (H) =
3  and P (T) =
This assignment of probabilities are also valid for H and T as these satisfy the axiomatic
definitions.
16.1.12  Probabilities of equally likely outcomes  Let a sample space of an experiment
be S = {w1, w2, ..., wn} and suppose that all the outcomes are equally likely to occur i.e.,
the chance of occurrence of each simple event must be the same
i.e.,
P (wi) = p for all wi ∈ S, where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1
Since
i.e.,
p + p + p + ... + p (n times) = 1
n p = 1,     i.e.      p =
Let S be the sample space and E be an event, such that n (S) = n and n (E) = m. If each
outcome is equally likely, then it follows that
P (E) = m
n  = Numberof outcomesfavourabletoE
Total number of possibleoutcomes
16.1.13  Addition rule of probability  If A and B are any two events in a sample
PROBABILITY    289
space S, then the probability that atleast one of the events A or B will occur is given by
P (A ∪ B) = P (A) + P (B) – P (A ∩ B)
Similarly, for three events A, B and C, we have
P (A ∪ B ∪ C) = P (A) + P (B) + P (C) – P (A ∩ B) – P (A ∩ C) – P (B ∩ C) +
P (A ∩ B ∩ C)
16.1.14   Addition rule for mutually exclusive events  If A and B are disjoint sets,
P (A ∪ B) = P(A) + P (B) [since P(A ∩ B) = P(φ) = 0, where A and B are disjoint].

Short Answer Type (S.A.)
Example 1  An ordinary deck of cards contains 52 cards divided into four suits. The
red suits are diamonds and hearts and black suits are clubs and spades. The cards J, Q,
and K are called face cards. Suppose we pick one card from the deck at random.
What is the sample space of the experiment?
What is the event that the chosen card is a black face card?
Solution
The outcomes in the sample space S are 52 cards in the deck.
Let E be the event that a black face card is chosen. The outcomes in E are Jack,
Queen, King or spades or clubs. Symbolically
E = {J, Q, K, of spades and clubs}  or  E = {J♣, Q♣, K♣, J♠, Q♠, K♠}
Example 2  Suppose that each child born is equally likely to be a boy or a girl. Consider
a family with exactly three children.
List the eight elements in the sample space whose outcomes are all possible
genders of the three children.
Write each of the following events as a set and find its probability :
(i) The event that exactly one child is a girl.
(ii) The event that at least two children are girls
(iii) The event that no child is a girl
Solution
All possible genders are expressed as :
S = {BBB, BBG, BGB, BGG, GBB,GBG, GGB, GGG}
290    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
(i)Let A denote the event : ‘exactly one child is a girl’
A = {BBG, BGB, GBB}
P (A) = 3
Let B denote the event that at least two children are girls.
B = {GGB, GBG, BGG, GGG}, P (B) = 4
(iii)
Let C denote the event : ‘no child is a girl’.
C = {BBB}
P (C) = 1
Example 3
How many two-digit positive integers are multiples of 3?
What is the probability that a randomly chosen two-digit positive integer is a
multiple of 3?
Solution
2 digit positive integers which are multiples of 3 are 12, 15, 18, ... , 99. Thus,
there are 30 such integers.
2-digit positive integers are 10, 11, 12, ... , 99. Thus, there are 90 such numbers.
Since out of these, 30 numbers are multiple of 3, therefore, the probability that a
randomly chosen positive 2-digit integer is a multiple of  3, is 30
Example 4  A typical PIN (personal identification number) is a sequence of any four
symbols chosen from the 26 letters in the alphabet and the ten digits. If all PINs are
equally likely, what is the probability that a randomly chosen PIN contains a repeated
symbol?
Solution  A PIN is a sequence of four symbols selected from 36 (26 letters + 10 digits)
symbols.
By the fundamental principle of counting, there are 36 × 36 × 36 × 36 = 364 = 1,679,616
PINs in all. When repetition is not allowed the multiplication rule can be applied to
conclude that there are
36 × 35 × 34 × 33 = 1,413,720 different PINs
PROBABILITY    291
The number of PINs that contain at least one repeated symbol
= 1,679,616 – 1,413,720 = 2,65,896
Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen PIN contains a repeated symbol is
265,896
1, 679, 616 = .1583
Example 5  An experiment has four possible outcomes A, B, C and D, that are mutually
exclusive. Explain why the following assignments of probabilities are not permissible:
P(A) = .12,
P (B) = .63,
P (C) = 0.45,
P (D) = – 0.20
P(A) = 9
120 ,
P (B) =  45
P (C) =  27
P (D) =  46
Solution
Since P(D) = – 0.20, this is not possible as 0 ≤ P (A) ≤ 1 for any event A.
P(S) = P (A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D) = 9
120  + 45
120  + 27
120  + 46
120  = 127 1
120≠.
This violates the condition that P (S) = 1.
Example 6  Probability that a truck stopped at a roadblock will have faulty brakes or
badly worn tires are 0.23 and 0.24, respectively. Also, the probability is 0.38 that a
truck stopped at the roadblock will have faulty brakes and/or badly working tires. What
is the probability that a truck stopped at this roadblock will have faulty breaks as well
as badly worn tires?
Solution  Let B be the event that a truck stopped at the roadblock will have faulty
brakes and T be the event that it will have badly worn tires. We have P (B) = 0.23,
P (T) = 0.24 and P (B∪T) = 0.38
P (B ∪ T) = P (B) + P (T) – P (B ∩ T)
0.38 = 0.23 + 0.24 – P (B ∩ T)
P (B ∩ T) = 0.23 + 0.24 – 0.38 = 0.09
Example 7  If a person visits his dentist, suppose the probability that he will have his
teeth cleaned is 0.48, the probability that he will have a cavity filled is 0.25, the probability
that he will have a tooth extracted is 0.20, the probability that he will have a teeth
cleaned and a cavity filled is 0.09, the probability that he will have his teeth cleaned and
a tooth extracted is 0.12, the probability that he will have a cavity filled and a tooth
extracted is 0.07, and the probability that he will have his teeth cleaned, a cavity filled,
and a tooth extracted is 0.03. What is the probability that a person visiting his dentist
292    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
will have atleast one of these things done to him?
Solution  Let C be the event that the person will have his teeth cleaned and F and E be
the event of getting cavity filled or tooth extracted, respectively. We are given
P(C) = 0.48, P (F) = 0.25,
P (E) = .20,
P (C ∩ F) = .09,
P (C ∩ E) = 0.12, P (E ∩ F) = 0.07   and
P (C ∩ F ∩ Ε) = 0.03
P ( C ∪ F ∪ E) = P (C) + P (F) + P (E)
– P (C ∩ F) – P (C ∩ E) – P (F ∩ E)
+ P (C ∩ F ∩ E)
= 0.48 + 0.25 + 0.20 – 0.09 – 0.12 – 0.07 + 0.03
= 0.68

Example 8 An urn contains twenty white slips of paper numbered from 1 through 20,
ten red slips of paper numbered from 1 through 10, forty yellow slips of paper numbered
from 1 through 40, and ten blue slips of paper numbered from 1 through 10. If these 80
slips of paper are thoroughly shuffled so that each slip has the same probability of being
drawn. Find the probabilities of drawing a slip of paper that is
blue or white
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
red or yellow and numbered 1, 2, 3 or 4
numbered 5, 15, 25, or 35;
white and numbered higher than 12 or yellow and numbered higher than 26.
Solution
P (Blue or White) = P (Blue) + P (White)
(Why?)
P (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5)
= P (1 of any colour) + P (2 of any colour)
+ P (3 of any colour) + P (4 of any colour) + P (5 of any colour)
=  20
P (Red or yellow and numbered 1, 2, 3 or 4)
= P (Red numbered 1, 2, 3 or 4) + P (yellow numbered 1, 2, 3 or 4)
PROBABILITY    293
P (numbered 5, 15, 25 or 35)
= P (5) + P (15) + P (25) + P (35)
= P (5 of White, Red, Yellow, Blue) + P (15 of White, Yellow) + P (25 of Yellow)
+ P (35 of Yellow)
P (White and numbered higher than 12 or Yellow and numbered higher than 26)
= P (White and numbered higher than 12)
+ P (Yellow and numbered higher than 26)

Choose the correct answer from given four options in each of the Examples 9 to 15
(M.C.Q.).
Example 9  In a leap year the probability of having 53 Sundays or 53 Mondays is
Solution  (B) is the correct answer. Since a leap year has 366 days and hence 52
weeks and 2 days. The 2 days can be SM, MT, TW, WTh, ThF, FSt, StS.
Therefore,
P (53 Sundays or 53 Mondays) = 3
Example 10  Three digit numbers are formed using the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. A number is
chosen at random out of these numbers. What is the probability that this number has
the same digits?
Solution (D) is the correct answer. Since a 3-digit number cannot start with digit 0, the
hundredth place can have any of the 4 digits. Now, the tens and units place can have all
the 5 digits. Therefore, the total possible 3-digit numbers are 4 × 5 × 5, i.e., 100.
294    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
The total possible 3 digit numbers having all digits same = 4
Hence, P (3-digit number with same digits) =
Example 11  Three squares of chess board are selected at random. The probability of
getting 2 squares of one colour and other of a different colour is
(D) 3
Solution (A) is the correct answer.  In a chess board, there are 64 squares of which
32 are white and 32 are black. Since 2 of one colour and 1 of other can be 2W, 1B, or
1W, 2B, the number of ways is (32C2 × 32C1) × 2 and  also, the number of ways of
choosing any 3 boxes is 64C3.
Hence,  the required probability =
Example 12  If A and B are any two events having P (A ∪ B) = 1
2  and  P ( A) = 2
then the probability of A ∩ B is
(C) 1
(D)  1
Solution (C) is the correct answer. We have  P(A ∪ B) =
P (A ∪ (B – A)) =
P (A) +  P (B – A) =
2 (since A and B – A are mutually exclusive)
1 – P ( A) +  P (B – A) = 1
1 – 2
3 + P (B – A) = 1
PROBABILITY    295
P (B – A) = 1
P ( A ∩  B) =
(since A  ∩ B ≡ B – A)
Example 13  Three of the six vertices of a regular hexagon are chosen at random.
What is the probability that the triangle with these vertices is equilateral?
Solution  (D) is the correct answer.
Fig. 16.1
ABCDEF is a regular hexagon. Total number of triangles 6C3 = 20. (Since no three
points are collinear). Of these only Δ ACE; Δ BDF are equilateral triangles.
Therefore, required probability = 2
Example 14  If A, B, C are three mutually exclusive and exhaustive events of an
experiment such that
3P(A) = 2P(B) = P(C), then P(A) is equal to
Solution  (B) is the correct answer. Let 3P (A) = 2P(B) = P(C) = p which gives p (A)
, P(B) = 2
and P(C) = p
Now since A, B, C are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, we have
P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1
296    EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS – MATHEMATICS
p = 6
Hence, P (A) = 3
Example 15 One mapping (function) is selected at random from all the mappings of
the set A = {1, 2, 3, ..., n} into itself. The probability that the mapping selected is one to
one is
none of these
Solution  (C) is the correct answer. Total number of mappings from a set A having n
elements onto itself is nn
Now, for one to one mapping the first element in A can have any of the n images in A;
the 2nd element in A can have any of the remaining (n – 1) images, counting like this,
the nth element in A can have only 1 image.
Therefore, the total number of one to one mappings is n .
Hence the required probability is

21. Assume that p is false, i.e., ~p is true
i.e., 3 is rational
∴ There exist two positive integers a and b such that
, a and b are coprime
⇒ a2 = 3b2 ⇒ 3 divides a2 ⇒ 3 divides a
∴ a = 3c, c is a positive integer,
∴ 9c2 = 3b2 ⇒ b2 = 3c2 ⇒ 3 divides b also
∴ 3 is a common factor of a and b which is a contradiction
as a, b are coprimes.
Hence p : 3  is irrational is true.
