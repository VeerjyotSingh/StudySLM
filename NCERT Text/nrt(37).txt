EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
CLASS XI
BIOLOGY
FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) – 2005 initiated a new phase of development
of syllabi and textbooks for all stages of school education. Conscious effort has been
made to discourage rote learning and to diffuse sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. This is well in tune with the NPE–1986 and Learning Without Burden-
1993 that recommend child centred system of education. The textbooks for Classes IX
and XI were released in 2006 and for Classes X and XII in 2007. Overall the books
have been well received by students and teachers.
NCF–2005 notes that treating the prescribed textbooks as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. It further reiterates that the methods used for teaching and evaluation will
also determine how effective these textbooks proves for making children’s life at school
a happy experience, rather than source of stress or boredom. It calls for reform in
examination system currently prevailing in the country.
The position papers of the National Focus Groups on Teaching of Science,
Teaching of Mathematics and Examination Reform envisage that the biology question
papers, set in annual examinations conducted by the various Boards do not really
assess genuine understanding of the subjects. The quality of questions papers is
often not upto the mark. They usually seek mere information based on rote
memorization, and fail to test higher-order skills like reasoning and analysis, let along
lateral thinking, creativity, and judgment. Good unconventional questions, challenging
problems and experiment-based problems rarely find a place in question papers. In
order to address to the issue, and also to provide additional learning material, the
Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM) has made an attempt
to develop resource book of exemplar problems in different subjects at secondary and
higher-secondary stages. Each resource book contains different types of questions of
varying difficulty level. Some questions would require the students to apply
simultaneously understanding of more than one chapters/units. These problems are
not meant to serve merely as question bank for examinations but are primarily meant
to improve the quality of teaching/learning process in schools. It is expected that
these problems would encourage teachers to design quality questions on their own.
Students and teachers should always keep in mind that examination and assessment
should test comprehension, information recall, analytical thinking and problem- solving
ability, creativity and speculative ability.
A team of experts and teachers with an understanding of the subject and a
proper role of examination worked hard to accomplish this task. The material was
discussed, edited, and finally included in this resource book.
NCERT would welcome suggestions from students, teachers and parents which
would help us to further improve the quality of material in subsequent editions.

PREFACE
The Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM), National Council of
Educational Research and Training (NCERT), initiated the development of ‘Exemplar Problems’
in science and mathematics for secondary and higher secondary stages after completing the
preparation of textbooks based on National Curriculum Framework–2005.
The main objective of the book on ‘Exemplar Problems in Biology’ is to provide the teachers
and students a large number of quality problems with varying cognitive levels to facilitate
teaching learning of concepts in Biology that are presented through the textbook for Class
XI. It is envisaged that the problems included in this volume would help the teachers to
design tasks to assess effectiveness of their teaching and to know about the achievement of
their students besides facilitating preparation of balanced question papers for unit and
terminal tests. The feedback based on the analysis of students’ responses may help the
teachers in further improving the quality of classroom instructions. In addition, the problems
given in this book are also expected to help the teachers to perceive the basic characteristics
of good quality questions and motivate them to frame similar questions on their own. Students
can benefit themselves by attempting the exercises given in the book for self assessment
and also in mastering the basic techniques of problem solving. Some of the questions given
in the book are expected to challenge the understanding of the concepts of biology of the
students and their ability to applying them in novel situations.
The problems included in this book were prepared through a series of workshops organised
by the DESM for their development and refinement involving practicing teachers, subject
experts from universities and institutes of higher learning, and the members of the biology
group of the DESM whose names appear separately. We gratefully acknowledge their efforts
and thank them for their valuable contribution in our endeavour to provide good quality
instructional material for the school system.
I express my gratitude to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director and Professor G. Ravindra,
Joint Director, NCERT for their valuable motivation and guidance from time to time. Special
thanks are due to Dr. B. K. Tripathi, Professor, DESM for coordinating the programme, taking
pains in editing and refinement of problems and for making the manuscript pressworthy.
We look forward to feedback from students, teachers and parents for further improvement
of the contents of the book.

SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS
Enzymes are proteins. Proteins are long chains of aminoacids linked to
each other by peptide bonds. Aminoacids have many functional groups
in their structure. These functional groups are, many of them at least,
ionisable. As they are weak acids and bases in chemical nature, this
ionization is influenced by pH of the solution. For many enzymes, activity
is influenced by surrounding pH. This is depicted in the curve below,
explain briefly.

A gardener finds some broad-leaved dicot weeds growing in his lawns.
What can be done to get rid of the weeds efficiently?
The dicotyledonous plant grow by their apical shoot meristems while
grasses (which make lawns) possess intercalary meristem. Certain
auxins, such as synthetic 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) when
applied in excess can damage the shoot apical meristems but they do
not cause any damage to the intercalary meristems. Thus, when 2, 4-D
is sprayed on lawns, only the dicots get killed and the lawns become free
of weeds.

MODEL ANSWERS TO DESCRIPTIVE QUESTIONS
Briefly describe the following:
Atherosclerosis
Thrombocytes
Atherosclerosis: Sometimes deposition of calcium, fat, cholesterol and
fibrous tissues occurs in the blood vessel (e.g., coronary artery) supplying
blood to the heart muscles. This condition makes the lumen of arteries
narrower affecting blood supply to heart; which leads to Coronary Artery
Disease (CAD) also referred to as atherosclerosis.
Thrombocytes: Blood platelets are cell fragments produced from
megakaryocytes (they are special cells in the bone marrow) and also
referred as thrombocytes. Normal blood contains 1,50,000 - 3,50,000
platelets mm3. Thrombocytes release a variety of substances like
thrombokinase, most of which are involved in blood clothig. A significant
drop in the count of blood platelets can lead to Clotting disorders which
will lead to excessive blood loss from the body.
What is  the major site where RBCs are formed.
Bone marrow
Which part of the heart is responsible for initiating and maintaining
the rhythmic activity of the heart.
Sino-Atrial Node (S.A. Node)
Name the reptile which has four chambered heart.

What is the role played by Renin-Angiotensin in the regulation of kidney
function?
Renin is released from JGA on activation due to fall in the glomerula
blood pressure/flow. Renin converts angiotensinogen in blood to
angiotensin-I and further to angiotensin-II. Angiotensin-II being a
powerful vasoconstrictor, increase the glomerular blood pressure and
thereby GFR. Angiotensin-II also activates the adrenal cortex to release
aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na+ and water from the
distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure
and thereby GFR. This is generally known as the Renin - Angiotensin
mechanism.
The following parts in our body have specific name in Osteology, write
against each.

What are the point for articulation of pelvic and pectoral girdles?
The components of pelvic girdle are ilium, ischium and pubis. It
articulates with femur through acetabulum.
The component of pectoral girdle are scapula and clavicle. It is the
glenoid cavity of pectoral girdle in which head of humerus articulates.
What is the role-played by lutenizing hormones in males and females
respectively?
LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of androgens called male
hormones. In females, LH is essential for ovulation.
In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles)
and maintains the corpus luteum formed from the remnants of the
graafian follicles after ovulation.
What is the role of second messenger in hormone action?
Hormones which do not enter the target cell, interact with specific
receptors located on the surface of the target cell membranes and
generates second messengers (e.g., CAMP) on the inner side of plasma
membrane. The second messenger, in turn, carries out all the hormonal
functions.
Old people have weak immune system. What could be the reason?
Thymus is degenerated in old individual resulting in a decreased
production of thymosins. As a result the immune responses of old
persons become weak.

With the help of a schematic diagram describe the haplo-diptontic life
cycle pattern in plants.
In a sexually reproducing plant there is an alternation of generation
between a haploid and a diploid phase of plant bodies. The haploid
plant body is termed gametophyte while the diploid plant body is called
sporophyte. The gametophyte produces gametes by mitosis while the
haploid spores are produced by sporophyte following meiosis (reduction
MODEL ANSWERS TO DESCRIPTIVE QUESTIONS
division). Two gamete fuse together to produce a zygote which develops
into the diploid sporophyte.
In a haplodiplontic life  cycle pattern, such as in bryophyta or
pteridophyta both the phases of life are multicellular. However, in
bryophytes, the gametophytes are small, photosynthetic, independent
and represent dominant phase. The partly or totally dependent,
sporophyte is physically attached to the gametophyte. The (n) spores
dispersed by sporophyte germinate into individual gametophytic plants.
However, in pteridopyhtes the 2n (diploid) phase is dominant, well
organized, independent while the n phase though also freeliving and
independent is short lived and  photosynthetic. In both of these groups
of plants the mobile male gametes, antherozoid produced by sex organ
antheridium, travel to archegonium (bearing an egg cell) via the medium
of water. Egg cell is non motile hence the  reproduction is oogamous.

Lichen is usually cited as an example of ‘symbiosis’ in plants where
an algal and a fungal species live together for their mutual benefit.
What will happen if algal and fungal partners are separated from
each other?
Both will survive and grow normally and independent from each other.
Both will die
Algal component will survive while the fungal component will die.
Fungal component will survive while algal partner will die.
Based on your answer how do you justify this association as symbiosis.
BIOLOGY, EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
Lichen is usually cited as an example of symbiosis in biology where
in a fungal and an algal species live together for mutual benefit. The
algal component synthesizes the food through photosynthesis which
is utilized by the fungal species for its survival. The fungal component
in return provides shelter and waste products that are consumed by
algal species.
Experiments though have shown that algal component can grow
independently when separated from fungal species. But same is not true
with the fungal component which dies when separated from algal
component. This association is, therefore, a typical case of master- slave
relationship where fungus (master) has trapped the algal components
(slave) for its own survival while giving nothing in return to it . Some
authors consider this association as controlled parasitism or helotism
due to the fact that sometimes the fungus sends its haustoria into the
algal cells to derive  nourishment.

Explain the digestive system of cockroach with the help of a labelled
sketch.
The digestive system consists of alimentary canal and digestive glands.
The alimentary canal of cockroach is divided into foregut, midgut and
hindgut. The   mouth opens into a short tubular pharynx, leading to a
narrow tubular passage, the oesophagus, which opens into a sac like
crop used for storing food. The crop is followed by a gizzard or
proventriculus. Gizzard consists of six - chitinous plates called teeth
which helps in grinding food. The entire foregut is lined by cuticle. A
ring of six - eight blind tubular structures called hepatic or gastric caecae
is present at the junction of foregut and midgut which secrete digestive
juice. At the junction of midgut and hindgut is present another ring of
yellow colored thin filamentous malpighian tubules which help in
removal of excretory products from haemolymph. The hindgut is broader
than midgut and is differentiated into ileum, colon and rectum. The
rectum opens out through anus.

Relatively immobile- calcium, boron
BIOLOGY, EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
How is the aspect of mobility of elements important to horticulture
and agriculture?
Symptoms of deficiency of mobile elements are more pronounced
in older leaves and symptoms of deficiency of relatively immobile
element appear first in younger leaves. This information can be
utilised by horticulturist and agriculturist to get a broad idea of
the deficiency elements in plants.
Explain the mechanism of breathing with neat labelled sketches
Breathing involves two stages.
Inspiration: Inspiration is initated by the contraction of
diaphragm, which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in
the anterioposterior axis. The contraction of external inter-costal
muscles lifts up the ribs and the sternum causing an increase in
the volume of thoracic chamber in the dorso-ventral axis also. Such

an increase in thoracic volume leads to a similar increase in
pulmonary volume resulting in decreased intra-pulmonary
pressure to less than atmospheric pressure. This causes the
movement of external air into the lungs. i.e., inspiration.
Expiration:  The inter-costal muscles return the diaphragm and
sternum to their normal positions with relaxation of the diaphragm.
This reduces the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary

volume. As a result an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure to
slightly above the atmospheric pressure causes the expulsion of
air from the lungs i.e., expiration.
Explain different types of blood groups and donor compatibility by

group ‘A’ carries antigen-A and antibodies-B. The donor’s group for
blood group A are A and O. Blood group B carries antigen-B and
antibodies-A. The donor’s group for blood group B are B and O. Blood
group AB carries antigens A and B but no corresponding antibodies so,
the compatible donor’s group for blood group AB are A, B, AB and O
hence, blood group ‘AB’ is also called as “universal acceptor”. Blood
group ‘O’ carries no antigens but carries antibodies both A and B hence
its compatible donor’s group is only ‘O’ but it is a compatible donor
group for all the blood groups. A, B, AB and O hence, blood group ‘O’ is
called as ‘universal donor’.

BIOLOGY, EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
Muscle contraction is initiated by a neural signal, which after reaching
neuromuscular junction or motor end plate releases  a neurotransmitter,
as a result an action potential in the sarcolemma is generated. Action
potential spreads through muscle fibre and causes the release of calcium
ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in Ca2+ level leads to the binding of
calcium with a subunit of troponin on actin filaments and thereby
removes the masking of active sites for myosin. Utilising the energy from
ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head now binds to the exposed active site
on actin to form a cross-bridge. This pulls the attached actin filaments
towards the centre of ‘A’ band. The ‘Z’ line attached to these actins are
also pulled inwards thereby causing shortening of the sarcomere, i.e.,
contraction.
A new ATP binds to myosin head and the cross-bridge is broken. The
ATP is again hydrolysed by the myosin head and the cycle of cross-
bridge formation and breakage is repeated causing further sliding. The
process continues till the Ca++ ions are pumped back to the sarcoplasmic
cisternae resulting in masking of actin filaments and breakage of all
cross bridges. This cause the return of  ‘Z’ lines along with filaments
back to their original position, i.e., relaxation.
Differentiate between pectoral and pelvic girdle.
Pectoral and pelvic girdle help in the articulation of upper and lower
limbs respectively. Each girdle is made of two equal halves.
Each half of a pectoral girdle consists of clavicle and scapula. Scapula is
a large triangular flat bone. There is glenoid cavity at the joint of scapula,
clavicle and acromian process, which articulates with the head of
humerus to form the shoulder joint.
Each half of pelvic girdle is formed by three bones-ilium, ischium and
pubis. At the point of their fusion; there is a cavity called acetabulum to
which the head of femur articulates.

All seed plants including gymnosperms are heterosporous producing
megaspores and microspores that give rise respectively to
megagametophytes and microgametophytes, a condition required for
seed production. Production of seed is an extreme form of heterospory,
in which ovule is formed, the structure which develops into seed. The
seed has replaced the spore of lower plants as the unit of dispersal. The
presence of heterospory in pteridophytes indicates the evolution of
gymnosperms from pteridophytes.

Sulphur, besides being present in some amino acids essential for protein
synthesis, is also a constituent of several coenzymes, vitamins and
ferrodoxin which are involved in some biochemical pathway. It is present
in amino acid cystein.
The phenomenon by which the terminal apical bud suppresses the
growth of lateral buds is referred to as apical dominance. This is because
of the hormone auxin synthesised in the apical bud that inhibits lateral
bud development.
This can be overcome by removing the apical bud (decapitating) and
young leaves which will increase branching. It may also be possible to
overcome this phenomena by application of cytokinin and antiauxins
like ethylene chlorohydrin, DCA (dichloroanisole) etc.
The structures that get entangled in the teeth while eating fruits like
peach and pear are actually the stone cells or brachysclereids which are

help of reducing agents and hydrolysis of ATP. When eight
electrons (and 8H+) are accepted by N2, 2 NH3 are released
from the enzyme. The biochemical pathway can be
summarized by the reaction below:
N2 + 8e– + 8H+ + 16 ATP
  2 NH3 + 12ADP + 12 Pi
(ii) The end product of this reaction is ammonia.
(iii)
At physiological pH, the ammonia is protonated to
form NH4+ (ammonium) ion which is used to synthesize
amino acids in plants. The synthesis of amino acids take
place by two main ways viz. Reductive amination and
transamination.
a—It is actively mobilized
b—Highly mobile- Nitrogen, magnesium
Relatively immobile- Sulphur, Calcium
c—Symptoms of deficiency of mobile elements are more
pronounced in older leaves and symptoms of deficiency of
relatively immobile element appear first in younger leaves.
This information can be utilised by horticulturist and
agriculturist to get a broad idea of the deficiency elements
in plants.
