FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) – 2005 initiated a new phase of development
of syllabi and textbooks for all stages of school education. Conscious effort has been
made to discourage rote learning and to diffuse sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. This is well in tune with the NPE  – 1986 and Learning Without Burden-
1993 that recommend child centred system of education. The textbooks for Classes
IX and XI were released in 2006 and for Classes X and XII in 2007. Overall the books
have been well received by students and teachers.
NCF–2005 notes that treating the prescribed textbooks as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. It further reiterates that the methods used for teaching and evaluation will
also determine how effective these textbooks proves for making children’s life at school
a happy experience, rather than source of stress or boredom. It calls for reform in
examination system currently prevailing in the country.
The position papers of the National Focus Groups on Teaching of Science,
Teaching of Mathematics and Examination Reform envisage that the mathematics
question papers, set in annual examinations conducted by the various Boards do not
really assess genuine understanding of the subjects. The quality of question papers is
often not up to the mark. They usually seek mere information based on rote
memorization, and fail to test higher-order skills like reasoning and analysis, let along
lateral thinking, creativity, and judgment. Good unconventional questions, challenging
problems and experiment-based problems rarely find a place in question papers. In
order to address to the issue, and also to provide additional learning material, the
Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM) has made an attempt
to develop resource book of exemplar problems in different subjects at secondary and
higher-secondary stages. Each resource book contains different types of questions of
varying difficulty level. Some questions would require the students to apply
simultaneously understanding of more than one chapters/units. These problems are
not meant to serve merely as question bank for examinations but are primarily meant
to improve the quality of teaching/learning process in schools. It is expected that these
problems would encourage teachers to design quality questions on their own. Students
and teachers should always keep in mind that examination and assessment should test

comprehension, information recall, analytical thinking and problem-solving ability,
creativity and speculative ability.
A team of experts and teachers with an understanding of the subject and a
proper role of examination worked hard to accomplish this task. The material was
discussed, edited and finally included in this source book.
NCERT will welcome suggestions from students, teachers and parents which
would help us to further improve the quality of material in subsequent editions.

PREFACE
The Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM), National
Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), initiated the
development of ‘Exemplar Problems’ in science and mathematics for secondary
and higher secondary stages after completing the preparation of textbooks based
on National Curriculum Framework–2005.
The main objective of the book on ‘Exemplar Problems in Mathematics’ is to
provide the teachers and students a large number of quality problems with varying
cognitive levels to facilitate teaching learning of concepts in mathematics that are
presented through the textbook for Class X. It is envisaged that the problems included
in this volume would help the teachers to design tasks to assess effectiveness of their
teaching and to know about the achievement of their students besides facilitating
preparation of balanced question papers for unit and terminal tests. The feedback
based on the analysis of students’ responses may help the teachers in further improving
the quality of classroom instructions. In addition, the problems given in this book are
also expected to help the teachers to perceive the basic characteristics of good quality
questions and motivate them to frame similar questions on their own. Students can
benefit themselves by attempting the exercises given in the book for self assessment
and also in mastering the basic techniques of problem solving. Some of the questions
given in the book are expected to challenge the understanding of the concepts of
mathematics of the students and their ability to applying them in novel situations.
The problems included in this book were prepared through a series of workshops
organised by the DESM for their development and refinement involving practicing
teachers, subject experts from universities and institutes of higher learning, and the
members of the mathematics group of the DESM whose names appear separately.
We gratefully acknowledge their efforts and thank them for their valuable contribution
in our endeavour to provide good quality instructional material for the school system.
I express my gratitude to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director and Professor
G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT for their valuable motivation and guidiance from
time to time. Special thanks are also due to Dr. R.P.Maurya, Reader in Mathematics,
DESM for coordinating the programme, taking pains in editing and refinement of problems
and for making the manuscript pressworthy.
We look forward to feedback from students, teachers and parents for further
improvement of the contents of this book.

STUDENTS’ EVALUATION IN MATHEMATICS
AT THE SECONDARY STAGE
A. Introduction
The fascinating world of mathematics provides an unlimited scope to mathematicians
to perceive problems pertaining to three situations visualised in the forms of concrete,
abstraction and intuition. However, due to abstraction and intuition, sometimes some
of the mathematical concepts become quite complicated even for teachers who are
actively engaged in mathematics teaching at various stages. This needs the exhaustive
training in methods/pedagogy as well as in contents. This also needs the clarifications
of mathematical concepts using instructional materials, experimentation, observation
and practicals etc. to avoid the abstraction at various stages of schooling. Good
mathematics instruction requires good teachers, and good teachers are those with
pedagogical content knowledge who, in turn, are predominantly those with good content.
Improvement of school mathematics education therefore begins with teaching teachers
the mathematics they need. In other words, the most difficult demand for becoming a
good teacher is to achieve a firm mastery of the mathematical content . Without such
a mastery, good pedagogy is difficult. A firm mastery of the content opens up the
world of pedagogy and offers many more effective pedagogical possibilities. Even
best pedagogy lavished on incorrect mathematics may result in poor quality in teaching.
Mathematics as a science of abstract objects, relies on logic rather than on observation,
yet it employs observation, simulation, and even experiments as means of discovering
truth. The ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life, that is,
developing children’s abilities for mathematisation is the main goal of mathematics
education as has been  emphasised in National Curriculum Framework-2005
(NCF-2005). It is in this context that NCF-2005 has set two distinct targets for
mathematics education at school  level viz. narrow and higher. The narrow aim of
school mathematics is to develop useful capabilities, particularly those relating to
numeracy- number, number operations, measurements, decimals and percentages.
The higher aim is to develop the child’s resources to think and reason mathematically,
to pursue assumptions to their logical conclusions and to handle abstractions. It includes
a way of doing things, and the ability and the attitude to formulate and solve problems.
This calls for curriculum to be ambitious in the sense that it seeks to achieve the higher
aim mentioned above, rather than only the narrow aim. It should be coherent in the
© NCERT

sense that the variety of methods and skills available piecemeal (in arithmetic, algebra,
geometry) cohere into an ability to address problems that come from other domains
such as sciences and in social studies at secondary stage. It should be important in the
sense that students feel the need to solve such problems.
Evaluation is a very comprehensive term which, in general, includes evaluating any
object, individual, event, trend, etc. A most common type of individual evaluation is the
evaluation of a student. It includes the assessments of the performance of the student
in the areas of her personality development in terms of intellectual, social and emotional
developments after she has been provided learning experiences through classroom
processes. Besides the factors like quality of teaching curricular materials, instructional
technology, school infrastructure and societal support also influence the learning and
experiences. In educational terminology, these areas of personality development are
called scholastic and co-scholastic areas. Due to its wider applications in various other
fields, mathematics is the most important scholastic area. It is for this reason,
mathematics is a compulsory subject up to the secondary stage from quite a long time.
This is the stage which acts as a bridge between the students who will continue with
Mathematics in higher classes. Therefore, evaluation of Mathematics at this stage
requires special attention. This evaluation is done to assess whether the main aim or objectives
laid down in NCF-2005 have been achieved by the students or not?
B. Purposes of Evaluation
There are various purposes of evaluation. Some of these are to know the answers for
the following questions:
How has the teaching been effective?
Which method is more suitable for teaching a particular topic or concept?
(iii)
To what extent students are ready to learn a particular topic?
What type of learning difficulties are faced by the students?
Do the students require remedial measures?
Which students are to be provided some enrichment materials?
(vii) Which topics are more difficult for the student?
(viii) Is there a need to make a change in the teaching strategy for a particular topic?
How can the result of the evaluation can be utilised for the all round development
of students?

C. Types of Evaluation
Evaluation is mainly of two types namely
(i)  Summative and  (ii) Formative
(i) Summative Evaluation: It is done at the end of the course or a term. It involves
a formal testing of the student’s achievements and is used for grading, ranking
and certifying the achievements of the students.
(ii) Formative Evaluation: It is in-built in the teaching learning process. It is a
continuous process going on throughout the course. The purpose of such evaluation
is to obtain feedback so that teaching or instructional strategies could be improved.
Further, on the basis of the feedback, strategies and weaknesses of the students
can be assessed.
NCF-2005 has also given more stress on continuous and comprehensive evaluation
in comparison to the summative evaluation. For this, a mathematics teacher may
(i) ask some questions to know to what extent the students understand about the
new concept to be taught before it is started.
(ii) ask questions at regular intervals to check the understanding of students during
the presentation of a concept.
(iii) assess students by the questions asked by them during the teaching of a chapter.
(iv) assess the students during class work.
(v) assess students on the basis of the home assignments given to them.
(vi) assess students by asking some questions at the end of the chapter.
(vii) encourage peer group members (students) to evaluate one another. This may be
called as Peer Evaluation. This evaluation can bring out the hidden talents among
the students.
Thus, whatever may be the way of evaluation, it is done through some well thought
questions, which may be referred to as good questions.
D. Characteristics of a Good Question
Quality of a question depends on the situation where it is to be used. In general,
following are some of the characteristics of a ‘good question’:
(i) Validity: A question is said to be valid, if it serves the purpose for which it has
been framed.
Thus, for a question to be valid, it must be based on (a) a specified content area
and also on (b) a predetermined aim or objective.
In case it is not valid, it will be treated as a question ‘out of course or syllabus’.

(ii) Reliability: A question is said to be reliable, if its answer gives the true  achievement
of the student. In other words, the achievement of the student must be free from
chance errors. These errors, generally, occur due to vagueness of language or
direction provided in the question. They may occur (1) at the time when the
student is answering the question and (2) at the time when the teacher is evaluating
the answer. In view of the above, following steps can ensure higher reliability of
a question:
(a) The question should admit of one and only one interpretation.
(b) The scope of the answer must be clear.
(c) The directions to the question must be clear.
(d) A well thought marking scheme should be provided for the question.
(iii)  Difficulty Level: Difficulty level is a very important characteristic of a question.
In different situations, questions of different difficulty levels are needed. For
example, for assessing the achievement of Minimum Level of Learning, there
will always be a need of questions of lower difficulty level. Difficulty level of a
question may be categorised in the following three types:
(a) Difficult: Which could be done by about less than 30% of the students.
(b) Average: Which could be done by ≥ 30% but ≤ 70% of the students.
(c) Easy: Which could be done by more than 70% of the students.
These levels can be decided by the question framer herself on the basis of her own
experiences.
(iv)  Language: Language of a question must be simple and within the comprehension
level of the student’s vocabulary. It should not lead to different answers. However,
if necessary, the same question can be presented before the students at different
difficulty levels, by using a little different language or wordings.
(v)  Form: There are different forms of questions and each form is more suitable than
the other depending upon the situations. There may be several factors for choosing
a particular form of questions. These  may be one or more of the following:
(a) Economy (b) Facility in printings (c) Ease in scoring and so on.
E. Different Forms of Questions
In general, the questions are of the following two forms:
(1)   Free Response Type and (2) Fixed Response Type
1.   Free Response Questions: In a free response question, a student formulates
and organizes her own answer. These type of questions are very much in use in the
present system of examination. These are of two types, namely
© NCERT
not to be republished
(a)  Long Answer Questions
A question which requires comparatively a lengthy answer is called a long answer
type question. These questions require the student to select relevant  facts, organise
them and write answers in her own words. In these type of questions, there is a very
little scope of guessing. However, if there are more number of long answer questions,
then the possibility of covering the whole content area in the examination will become
less. To overcome this difficulty, we may choose such long answer type questions
which involve more than one content areas.
(b)  Short Answer Questions
A question in which a student is expected to write the answer in 3 or 4 lines is called
a short answer type question. In these questions, the coverage of content areas is
more specific and definite. It may be noted that a question whose answer may be a
simple diagram is also considered to be a short answer type question.
2.    Fixed Response Questions: In these type of questions, the answer is fixed and
definite. These type of questions are being encouraged due to their objectivity in scoring.
They are also of two types, namely
(a)  Very Short Answer Questions
A question in which a student is expected to give the answer in just one word or a
phrase is called a very short answer type question. In mathematics, by a word or a
phrase, we generally mean a group of symbols or numbers (numerals). It is expected
to take 1 to 3 minutes to answer such a question. Fill in the blanks question is one of
the examples of such type of questions.
(b)  Objective Questions
An objective type question is one in which alternate answers are given and student
has to just indicate the correct answer. These questions can also be answered in just
1 to 3 minutes. They can be further classified into the following forms:
(i)   True-False Type: In these type of questions, a statement or formula is given and
the student is expected to write whether it is ‘True’ or ‘False’.
(ii)  Matching Type: These type of questions consist of two columns. The student
has to pair each item of first column with some item of the second column on the basis
of some criterion. The number of items in the second column may be more than that of
the first column.
(iii) Sentence Completion Type: In these type of questions, the student has to complete
the given sentence using one or more words given in brackets along with the question.
(iv) Multiple Choice Type:  In these type of questions, number of alternatives (usually
called distracters), only one is appropriate or correct. The student is expected to write
or tick (9) the correct alternative.
(xii)

In the fixed response questions, the scope of guess work is very high. However,
this can be minimised by attaching some element of reasoning in such questions. We
may call these questions as Short Answer Questions with Reasoning.
F. Instructional Objectives
As already stated, a question is said to be valid if it also based on a predetermined
objective. The word ‘objective’ is a wider term. Objectives are divided into two groups,
namely (1) educational objectives and (2) instructional objectives. Educational objectives
play a directive role in the process of education, while instructional objectives are
those goals for the achievement of which all educational efforts are directed.
Mathematics is a special language with its own vocabulary and grammar. The
vocabulary consists of concepts, terms, facts, symbols, assumptions, etc., while the
grammar relates to principles, processes, functional relationships, etc. Knowledge and
understanding of these and their applications to new situations have helped mankind to
achieve tremendous progress in various fields. Therefore, the main instructional
objectives for mathematics are as follows:
1.   Knowledge with Specifications
The students
recall or reproduce terms, facts, etc.
recognise terms, symbols, concepts, etc.
2.   Understanding with Specifications
The students
give illustrations for terms, definitions, etc.
detect conceptual errors (and correct) in definitions, statements, formulae, etc.
compare concepts, quantities, etc.
discriminate between closely related concepts
translate verbal statements into mathematical statements and vice-versa
verify the results arrived at
classify data as per criteria
find relationships among the given data
interpret the data
3.   Application with Specification
The students
analyse and find out what is given and what is required to be done
find out the adequecy, superflousity and relevancy of data
estabish relationship among the data
(xiii)

reason out deductively
select appropriate methods for solutions of problems
suggest alternative methods for solving problems
generalise from particular situations
4.   Skill with Specifications
The students
Carry out calculation easily and quickly
Handle geometrical instruments properly
Draw figure accurately and to the scale
Read tables and graphs properly
Interpret graphs correctly
As far as the main goal or objective in the NCF-2005 is concerned, it is to
develop abilities in the student for mathematisation. It also states (1) the narrow aims
of school mathematics, which concern with decimals and percents and (2) the higher
aims, which are for developing the child resources to think and reason mathematically,
to pursue assumption to their logical conclusions and to handle abstractions. Keeping
this in view, at this stage, the stress is only on the higher aims. These higher aims may
be considered as the instructional objectives. Objective based questions and objective
type questions are often confused with each other. When a question is framed keeping
a definite aim or objective in mind, it is called an objective based question, while if a
question is framed to measure the students achievement which is objective rather than
subjective is called objective type question. It may also be noted that determination of
the objective of a question varies from person to person. For example, a question may
appear to be of ‘knowledge’ type to one teacher who may think that the answer of the
question is known to the students, but the same question may appear to be of
understanding type to another teacher if she thinks that the question is completely
unknown to the same group of students. In the light of the views expressed in
NCF-2005, the following types of questions are suggested:
Long answer questions
Short answer questions
Short answer questions with reasoning
Multiple choice questions
It is hoped that these questions along with the questions in the textbook
would be effectively able to evaluate the Classes IX and X students in mathematics.

(A) Main Concepts and Results
Euclid’s Division Lemma : Given two positive integers a and b, there exist unique
integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r < b.
Euclid’s Division Algorithm to obtain the HCF of two positive integers, say c and d,
c > d.
Step 1 : Apply Euclid’s division lemma to c and d, to find whole numbers q and r,
such that c = dq + r, 0 ≤ r < d.
Step 2 : If r = 0, d is the HCF of c and d. If r ≠ 0, apply the division lemma to
d and r.
Step 3 : Continue the process till the remainder is zero. The divisor at this stage
will be the required HCF.
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic : Every composite number can be expressed
as a product of primes, and this expression (factorisation) is unique, apart from the
order in which the prime factors occur.
Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, where a is a positive
integer.
3 , 5  are irrational numbers.
The sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational.
The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is
irrational.
For any two positive integers a and b, HCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b.

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
According to Euclid’s division lemma,
a = 3q + r, where 0 ≤ r < 3
and r is an integer. Therefore, the values of r can be 0, 1 or 2.
Sample Question 2: Can the number 6n, n being a natural number, end with the
digit 5? Give reasons.
Solution : No, because 6n = (2 × 3)n = 2n × 3 n, so the only primes in the factorisation
of 6n are 2 and 3, and not 5.
Hence, it cannot end with the digit 5.
EXERCISE 1.2
Write whether every positive integer can be of the form 4q + 2, where q is an
integer. Justify your answer.
“The product of two consecutive positive integers is divisible by 2”. Is this statement
true or false? Give reasons.
“The product of three consecutive positive integers is divisible by 6”. Is this statement
true or false”? Justify your answer.
Write whether the square of any positive integer can be of the form 3m + 2, where
m is a natural number. Justify your answer.
A positive integer is of the form 3q + 1, q being a natural number. Can you write its
square in any form other than 3m + 1, i.e., 3m or 3m + 2 for some integer m? Justify
your answer.
The numbers 525 and 3000 are both divisible only by 3, 5, 15, 25 and 75. What is

(D) Short Answer  Questions
Sample Question 1: Using Euclid’s division algorithm, find which of the following
pairs of numbers are co-prime:
(i) 231, 396         (ii) 847, 2160
Solution : Let us find the HCF of each pair of numbers.
396 = 231 × 1 + 165
231 = 165 × 1 + 66
165 = 66 × 2 + 33
66 = 33 × 2 + 0
Therefore, HCF = 33. Hence, numbers are not co-prime.
2160 = 847 × 2 + 466
847 = 466 × 1 + 381
466 = 381 × 1 + 85
381 = 85 × 4   + 41
85   = 41 × 2   +  3
41   =   3 × 13 +  2
3     =   2 × 1  +  1
2     =   1 × 2  +  0
Therefore, the HCF = 1. Hence, the numbers are co-prime.
Sample Question 2: Show that the square of an odd positive integer is of the form
8m + 1, for some whole number m.
Solution: Any positive odd integer is of the form 2q + 1, where q is a whole number.
Therefore,   (2q + 1) 2 = 4q2 + 4q + 1 = 4q (q + 1) + 1,
q  (q + 1) is either 0 or even. So, it is 2m, where m is a whole number.
Therefore,   (2q + 1) 2 = 4.2 m + 1 = 8 m + 1.
[From (1)]
Sample Question 3: Prove that
is irrational.
Solution : Let us suppose that
is rational. Let
= a , where a is
rational.

Therefore,
Squaring on both sides, we get
2 = a2 + 3 – 2
Therefore,
, which is a contradiction as the right hand side is a rational
number while
3  is irrational. Hence, 2
is irrational.
EXERCISE 1.3
Show that the square of any positive integer is either of the form 4q or 4q + 1 for
some integer q.
Show that cube of any positive integer is of the form 4m, 4m + 1 or 4m + 3, for

(E) Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : Show that the square of an odd positive integer can be of the
form 6q + 1 or 6q + 3 for some integer q.
Solution : We know that any positive integer can be of the form 6m, 6m + 1, 6m + 2,
6m + 3, 6m + 4 or 6m + 5, for some integer m.
Thus, an odd positive integer can be of the form 6m + 1, 6m + 3, or 6m + 5
Thus we have:
(6 m +1)2 = 36 m2 + 12 m + 1 = 6 (6 m2 + 2 m) + 1 = 6 q + 1, q is an integer
(6 m + 3)2 = 36 m2 + 36 m + 9 = 6 (6 m2 + 6 m + 1) + 3 = 6 q + 3, q is an integer
(6 m + 5) 2 = 36 m2 + 60 m + 25 = 6 (6 m2 + 10 m + 4) + 1 = 6 q + 1, q is an integer.
Thus, the square of an odd positive integer can be of the form 6q + 1 or 6q + 3.

The graph of y = 3 is a line parallel to the x-axis at a distance of 3 units above it.
So, the line m is the graph of y = 3.
The figure enclosed by the lines x = –2, y = 3, the x-axis and the y-axis is OABC,
which is a rectangle. (Why?)
A is a point on the y-axis at a distance of 3 units above the x-axis. So, the coordinates
of A are (0, 3);
C is a point on the x-axis at a distance of 2 units to the left of y-axis. So, the coordinates
of C are (–2, 0)
B is the solution of the pair of equations x = –2 and y = 3. So, the coordinates of B are
(–2, 3)
So, the vertices of the rectangle OABC are O (0, 0),  A (0, 3), B (–2, 3), C (–2, 0)
The length and breadth of this rectangle are 2 units and 3 units, respectively.
As the area of a rectangle = length × breadth,
the area of rectangle OABC = 2 × 3 = 6 sq. units.

5x – y = 5,   x + 2y = 1 and  6x + y = 17.
Solution:
The vertex of a triangle is the common solution of the two equations forming its two
sides. So, solving the given equations pairwise will give the vertices of the triangle.
From the given equations, we will have the following three pairs of equations:
5x – y = 5
x + 2y = 1
x + 2y = 1
6x + y = 17
5x – y = 5
6x + y = 17
Solving the pair of equations
5x – y = 5
x + 2y = 1
we get, x = 1, y = 0
So, one vertex of the triangle is (1, 0)
Solving the second pair of equations
x + 2y = 1
6x + y = 17
we get x = 3, y = –1
So, another vertex of the triangle is (3, –1)
Solving the third pair of equations
5x – y = 5
6x + y = 17,
we get x = 2, y = 5.
So,  the third vertex of the triangle is (2, 5). So, the three vertices of the triangle are
(1, 0), (3, –1) and (2, 5).

The selling price of the chair when it is sold at a profit of 25%
When the table is sold at a profit of 25%, its selling price
When the chair is sold at a profit of 10%, its selling price
From Equations (1) and (2), we get
110x + 125y = 105000
and  125x + 110y = 106500
On adding and subtracting these equations, we get
235x + 235y = 211500
15x – 15y = 1500
i.e.,
x+y = 900
x – y = 100
Solving Equations (3) and (4), we get
x = 500, y = 400
So, the cost price of the table is Rs 500 and the cost price of the chair is Rs 400.

Sample Question 4: It can take 12 hours to fill a swimming pool using two pipes. If
the pipe of larger diameter is used for 4 hours and the pipe of smaller diameter for
9 hours, only half the pool can be filled.How long would it take for each pipe to fill the
pool separately?
Solution:
Let the time taken by the pipe of larger diameter to fill the pool be x hours and that
taken by the pipe of smaller diameter pipe alone be y hours.
In x hours, the pipe of larger diameter fills the pool.
So, in 1 hour the pipe of larger diameter fills
x part of the pool, and so, in 4 hours, the
pipe of larger diameter fills
x  parts of the pool.
Similarly, in 9 hours, the pipe of smaller diameter fills
y  parts of the pool.
According to the question,
Also, using both the pipes, the pool is filled in 12 hours.

x2 – 9x – 90 = 0
i.e.,
x2 – 15x + 6x – 90 = 0
i.e.,
x(x – 15) + 6(x –15) = 0

the given list of numbers is an AP.
The nth term an (or the general term) of an AP is an = a + (n – 1) d,  where a is
the first term and d is the common difference. Note that
The sum Sn of the first n terms of an AP is given by
Sn = 2
[2a + (n – 1) d]
If l is the last term of an AP of n terms, then the sum of all the terms can also be

(C) Short Answer Questions with Reasoning
Sample Question 1: In the AP: 10, 5, 0, –5, ... the common difference d is equal to 5.
Justify whether the above statement is true or false.
Solution :
a2 – a1 = 5 – 10 = – 5
a3 – a2 = 0 – 5 = – 5
a4 – a3 = –5 – 0 = – 5
Although the given list of numbers forms an AP, it is with d = –5 and not with d = 5
So, the given statement is false.
Sample Question 2 : Divya deposited Rs 1000 at compound interest at the rate of
10% per annum. The amounts at the end of first year, second year, third year, ..., form
an AP. Justify your answer.
Solution :
Amount at the end of the 1st year = Rs 1100
Amount at the end of the 2nd year = Rs 1210
Amount at the end of 3rd year = Rs 1331 and so on.
So, the amount (in Rs) at the end of 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, ... are
1100, 1210, 1331, ...
Here,
a2 – a1 = 110
a3 – a2 = 121
a2 – a1 ≠ a3 – a2, it does not form an AP.

(iii)  1+n+n2
(D) Short Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : If the numbers  n – 2, 4n – 1 and 5n + 2 are in AP, find the
value of n.
Solution :
As n – 2, 4n – 1, 5n + 2 are in AP,
(4n – 1) – (n – 2) = (5n + 2) – (4n – 1)
3n + 1 = n + 3
n = 1
Sample Question 2 :  Find the value of the middle most term (s) of the AP :
–11, –7, –3,..., 49.
Solution :
Here, a = –11,
d = –7 – (–11) = 4, an = 49
We have an = a + (n – 1) d
49 = –11 + (n – 1) × 4
i.e.,
60 = (n – 1) × 4
i.e.,
n = 16
As n is an even number, there will be two middle terms which are
th and
1 th,  i.e., the
8th term and the 9th term.

ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS
a8 = a + 7d = –11 + 7 × 4 = 17
a9 = a + 8d = –11 + 8 × 4 = 21
So, the values of the two middle most terms are 17 and 21, respectively.
Sample Question 3: The sum of the first three terms of an AP is 33. If the product of
the first and the third term exceeds the second term by 29, find the AP.
Solution : Let the three terms in AP be
a – d, a, a + d.
a – d + a + a + d = 33
a = 11
Also,
(a – d) (a + d) = a + 29
i.e.,
a2 – d 2 = a + 29
i.e.,
121 – d2 = 11 + 29
i.e.,
d 2 = 81
i.e.,
d = ± 9
So there will be two APs and they are : 2, 11, 20, ...
and  20, 11, 2, ...

Short Answer Questions
Sample Question 1: Legs (sides other than the hypotenuse) of a right triangle are of
lengths 16cm and 8 cm. Find the length of the side of the largest square that can be
inscribed in the triangle.
Solution:  Let ABC be a right triangle right angled at  B with AB = 16 cm and BC =
8 cm. Then, the largest square BRSP which can be inscribed in this triangle will be as
shown in Fig.6.6.
Let PB = x cm. So., AP = (16–x) cm. In APS and ABC, A = A and
APS = ABC (Each 90°)
So, APS ~ ABC (AA similarity)
Therefore, AP
128 – 8x = 16x
x = 128
Thus, the side of the required square is of length 16
3  cm.

Sample Question 2: Hypotenuse of a right triangle is 25 cm and out of the remaining
two sides, one is longer than the other by 5 cm. Find the lengths of the other two sides.
Solution : Let one side be x cm. Then the other side will be (x + 5) cm.
Therefore, from Pythagoras Theorem
2 + (x + 5)
2 = (25)
2 + x
2 + 10 x + 25 = 625
2 + 5 x – 300 = 0
2 + 20 x – 15 x –300 = 0
x (x+20) –15 (x +20) = 0
(x–15) (x +20) = 0
x =15 or  x= –20
Rejecting x = – 20, we have length of one side = 15 cm
and that of the other side = (15 + 5) cm = 20 cm
Sample Question 3:  In Fig 6.7,

So, AB = AC (Sides opposite to equal angles)

Sample Question 3: An aeroplane leaves an Airport and flies due North at
300 km/h. At the same time, another aeroplane leaves the same Airport and flies due
West at 400 km/h. How far apart the two aeroplanes would be after 1
12  hours?
Solution: Distance travelled by first aeroplane in 1
12  hours = 300 × 3
2  km = 450 km
and that by second aeroplane = 400 × 3 km
600 km
Position of the two aeroplanes after 1
12  hours would be A and B as shown in Fig. 6.14.
That is, OA = 450 km and OB = 600 km.
From  AOB, we have
AB2 = OA2 + OB2
= (450)2 + (600)2
= (150)2 × 32 + (150)2 × 42
= 1502  (32 + 42)
= 1502 × 52
AB = 150 × 5 = 750
Thus, the two aeroplanes will be 750 km apart  after 1

CA = 3 × 5 = 15, DE = 18, EF = 3× 5 + 9 = 24 and FD =  6 × 5 = 30
Hence, AB = 9 cm,  BC = 12 cm, CA = 15 cm,

(E) Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 :  The mid-points D, E, F of the sides of a triangle ABC are (3, 4),
(8, 9) and (6, 7). Find the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
Solution :  Since D and F are the mid-points of AB and AC, respectively, by
mid-point theorem, we can prove that DFEB is a parallelogram. Let the coordinates
of B be (x, y).
Refer to Sample Question 4 of Section (D) to get
x = 3 + 8 – 6 = 5
y = 4 + 9 – 7 = 6
Therefore, B (5, 6) is one of the vertices of the triangle.
Similarly DFCE and DAFE are also parallelograms, and the coordinates of A are
(3 + 6 – 8, 4 + 7 – 9) = (1, 2). Coordinates of C are (8 + 6 – 3, 9 + 7 – 4) = (11, 12).

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
In Fig. 8.2, B is moved closer to C along BC. It is observed that
(i) θ increases (as θ1 > θ, θ2 > θ1, ...) and
(ii) BC decreases (B1C < BC, B2C < B1C, ...)
Thus the perpendicular AC remains fixed and the base BC decreases. Hence tanθ
increases as θ increases.
Sample Question 3 : tanθ increases faster than sinθ as θ increases.
Solution : True
We know that sinθ increases as θ increases but cosθ decreases as θ increases.
We have
Now as θ increases, sinθ increases but cosθ decreases. Therefore, in case of tanθ, the
numerator increases and the denominator decreases. But in case of sinθ which can be
seen as sin
, only the numerator increases but the denominator remains fixed at 1.

Solution : Let A B be the chord of a circle of radius 10 cm, with O as the centre of the
circle (see Fig. 11.14).
Here, ∠A O B = 90° and we have to find the area of the major segment (which is
shaded). As  ∠AOB= 90°, therefore angle of the major sector = 360° – 90° = 270°
