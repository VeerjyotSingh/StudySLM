FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) – 2005 initiated a new phase of development
of syllabi and textbooks for all stages of school education. Conscious effort has been
made to discourage rote learning and to diffuse sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. This is well in tune with the NPE  – 1986 and Learning Without Burden-
1993 that recommend child centred system of education. The textbooks for Classes
IX and XI were released in 2006 and for Classes X and XII in 2007. Overall the books
have been well received by students and teachers.
NCF–2005 notes that treating the prescribed textbooks as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are
ignored. It further reiterates that the methods used for teaching and evaluation will
also determine how effective these textbooks proves for making children’s life at school
a happy experience, rather than source of stress or boredom. It calls for reform in
examination system currently prevailing in the country.
The position papers of the National Focus Groups on Teaching of Science,
Teaching of Mathematics and Examination Reform envisage that the mathematics
question papers, set in annual examinations conducted by the various Boards do not
really assess genuine understanding of the subjects. The quality of questions papers is
often not up to the mark. They usually seek mere information based on rote
memorization, and fail to test higher-order skills like reasoning and analysis, let along
lateral thinking, creativity, and judgment. Good unconventional questions, challenging
problems and experiment-based problems rarely find a place in question papers. In
order to address to the issue, and also to provide additional learning material, the
Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM) has made an attempt
to develop resource book of exemplar problems in different subjects at secondary and
higher-secondary stages. Each resource book contains different types of questions of
varying difficulty level. Some questions would require the students to apply
simultaneously understanding of more than one chapters/units. These problems are
not meant to serve merely as question bank for examinations but are primarily meant
to improve the quality of teaching/learning process in schools. It is expected that these
problems would encourage teachers to design quality questions on their own. Students
and teachers should always keep in mind that examination and assessment should test
29052014
comprehension, information recall, analytical thinking and problem-solving ability,
creativity and speculative ability.
A team of experts and teachers with an understanding of the subject and a
proper role of examination worked hard to accomplish this task. The material was
discussed, edited and finally included in this source book.
NCERT will welcome suggestions from students, teachers and parents which
would help us to further improve the quality of material in subsequent editions.

PREFACE
The Department of Education in Science and Mathematics (DESM), National
Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), initiated the
development of ‘Exemplar Problems’ in science and mathematics for secondary
and higher secondary stages after completing the preparation of textbooks based
on National Curriculum Framework–2005.
The main objective of the book on ‘Exemplar Problems in Mathematics’ is to
provide the teachers and students a large number of quality problems with varying
cognitive levels to facilitate teaching learning of concepts in mathematics that are
presented through the textbook for Class IX. It is envisaged that the problems included
in this volume would help the teachers to design tasks to assess effectiveness of their
teaching and to know about the achievement of their students besides facilitating
preparation of balanced question papers for unit and terminal tests. The feedback
based on the analysis of students responses may help the teachers in further improving
the quality of classroom instructions. In addition, the problems given in this book are
also expected to help the teachers to perceive the basic characteristics of good quality
questions and motivate them to frame similar questions on their own. Students can
benefit themselves by attempting the exercises given in the book for self assessment
and also in mastering the basic techniques of problem solving. Some of the questions
given in the book are expected to challenge the understanding of the concepts of
mathematics of the students and their ability to applying them in novel situations.
The problems included in this book were prepared through a series of workshops
organised by the DESM for their development and refinement involving practicing
teachers, subject experts from universities and institutes of higher learning, and the
members of the mathematics group of the DESM whose names appear separately.
We gratefully acknowledge their efforts and thank them for their valuable contribution
in our endeavour to provide good quality instructional material for the school system.
I express my gratitude to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director and Professor
G.Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT for their valuable motivation and guidiance from
time to time. Special thanks are also due to Dr. R.P.Maurya, Reader in Mathematics,
DESM for coordinating the programme, taking pains in editing and refinement of problems
and for making the manuscript pressworthy.
We look forward to feedback from students, teachers and parents for further
improvement of the contents of this book.

STUDENTS’ EVALUATION IN MATHEMATICS
AT SECONDARY STAGE
A. Introduction
The fascinating world of mathematics provides an unlimited scope to mathematicians
to perceive problems pertaining to three situations visualised in the forms of concrete,
abstraction and intuition. However, due to abstraction and intuition, sometimes some
of the mathematical concepts become quite complicated even for teachers who are
actively engaged in mathematics teaching at various stages. This needs the exhaustive
training in methods/ pedagogy as well as in contents. This also needs the clarifications
of mathematical concepts using instructional materials, experimentation, observation
and practicals etc. to avoid the abstraction at various stages of schooling. Good
mathematics instruction requires good teachers, and good teachers are those with
pedagogical content knowledge who, in turn, are predominantly those with good
content.  Improvement of school mathematics education therefore begins with teaching
teachers the mathematics they need. In other words, the most difficult demand for
becoming a good teacher is to achieve a firm mastery of the mathematical content .
Without such a mastery, good pedagogy is difficult. A firm mastery of the content
opens up the world of pedagogy and offers many more effective pedagogical
possibilities. Even best pedagogy lavished on incorrect mathematics may result in
poor quality in teaching.
Mathematics as a science of abstract objects, relies on logic rather than on observation,
yet it employs observation, simulation, and even experiments as means of discovering
truth. The ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life, that
is, developing children’s abilities for mathematisation is the main goal of mathematics
education as has been  emphasised in National Curriculum Framework-2005
(NCF-2005). It is in this content that NCF-2005 has set two distinct targets for
mathematics education at school  level viz. narrow and higher. The narrow aim of
school mathematics is to develop useful capabilities, particularly those relating to
numeracy- number, number operations, measurements, decimals and percentages. The
higher aim is to develop the child’s resources to think and reason mathematically, to
pursue assumptions to their logical conclusions and to handle abstractions. It includes
a way of doing things, and the ability and the attitude to formulate and solve problems.
This calls for curriculum to be ambitious in the sense that it seeks to achieve the
higher aim mentioned above, rather than only the narrow aim. It should be coherent in
29052014
the sense that the variety of methods and skills available piecemeal (in arithmetic,
algebra, geometry) cohere into an ability to address problems that come from other
domains such as sciences and in social studies at secondary stage. It should be important
in the sense that students feel the need to solve such problems.
Evaluation is a very comprehensive term which, in general, includes evaluating any
object, individual, event, trend, etc. A most common type of individual evaluation is the
evaluation of a student. It includes the assessments of the performance of the student
in the areas of her personality development in terms of intellectual, social and emotional
developments after she has been provided learning experiences through classroom
processes. Besides the factors like quality of teaching curricular materials, instructional
technology, school infrastructure and societal support also influence the learning and
experiences. In educational terminology, these areas of personality development are
called scholastic and co-scholastic areas. Due to its wider applications in various other
fields, mathematics is the most important scholastic area. It is for this reason,
mathematics is a compulsory subject up to the secondary stage from quite a long time.
This is the stage which acts as a bridge between the students who will continue with
Mathematics in higher classes. Therefore, evaluation of Mathematics at this stage
requires special attention. This evaluation is done to assess whether the main aim or objectives
laid down in NCF-2005 have been achieved by the students or not?
B. Purposes of Evaluation
There are various purposes of evaluation. Some of these are to know the answers for
the following questions:
How has the teaching been effective?
Which method is more suitable for teaching a particular topic or concept?
(iii)
To what extent students are ready to learn a particular topic?
What type of learning difficulties are faced by the students?
Do the students require remedial measures?
Which students are to be provided some enrichment materials?
(vii) Which topics are more difficult for the student?
(viii) Is there a need to make a change in the teaching strategy for a particular topic?
How can the result of the evaluation can be utilised for the all round development
of students?
29052014
C. Types of Evaluation
Evaluation is mainly of two types namely
(i)  Summative and  (ii) Formative
(i) Summative Evaluation: It is done at the end of the course or a term. It involves
a formal testing of the student’s achievements and is used for grading, ranking
and certifying the achievements of the students.
(ii) Formative Evaluation: It is in-built in the teaching learning process. It is a
continuous process going on throughout the course. The purpose of such evaluation
is to obtain feedback so that teaching or instructional strategies could be improved.
Further, on the basis of the feedback, strategies and weaknesses of the students
can be assessed.
NCF-2005 has also given more stress on continuous and comprehensive evaluation
in comparison to the summative evaluation. For this, a mathematics teacher may
(i) ask some questions to know to what extent the students understand about the
new concept to be taught before it is started.
(ii) ask question at regular intervals to check the understanding of students during the
presentation of a concept.
(iii) assess students by the questions asked by them during the teaching of a chapter.
(iv) assess the students during class work.
(v) assess students on the basis of the home assignments given to them.
(vi) assess students by asking some questions at the end of the chapter.
(vii) encourage peer group members (students) to evaluate one another. This may be
called as Peer Evaluation. This evaluation can bring out the hidden talents among
the students.
Thus, whatever may be the way of evaluation, it is done through some well thought
questions, which may be referred to as good questions.
D. Characteristics of a Good Question
Quality of a question depends on the situation where it is to be used. In general,
following are some of the characteristics of a ‘good question’:
(i) Validity: A question is said to be valid, if it serves the purpose for which it has
been framed.
Thus, for a question to be valid, it must be based on (a) a specified extent area
and also on (b) a predetermined aim or objective.
In case it is not valid, it will be treated as a question ‘out of course or syllabus’.
29052014
(ii) Reliability: A question is said to be reliable, if its answer gives the true  achievement
of the student. In other words, the achievement of the student must be free from
chance errors. These errors, generally, occur due to vagueness of language or
direction provided in the question. They may occur (1) at the time when the
student is answering the question and (2) at the time when the teacher is evaluating
the answer. In view of the above, following steps can ensure higher reliability of
a question:
(a) The question should admit of one and only one interpretation.
(b) The scope of the answer must be clear.
(c) The directions to the question must be clear.
(d) A well thought marking scheme should be provided for the question.
(iii)  Difficulty Level: Difficulty level is a very important characteristic of a question.
In different situations, questions of different difficulty levels are needed. For
example, for assessing the achievement of Minimum Level of Learning, there
will always be a need of questions of lower difficulty level. Difficulty level of a
question may be categorised in the following three types:
(a) Difficult: Which could be done by about less than 30% of the students.
(b) Average: Which could be done by ≥ 30% but ≤ 70% of the students.
(c) Easy: Which could be done by more than 70% of the students.
These levels can be decided by the question framer herself on the basis of her own
experiences.
(iv)  Language: Language of a question must be simple and within the comprehension
level of the student’s vocabulary. It should not lead to different answers. However,
if necessary, the same question can be presented before the students at different
difficulty levels, by using a little different language or wordings.
(v)  Form: There are different forms of questions and each form is more suitable than
the other depending upon the situations. There may be several factors for choosing
a particular form of questions. There  may be one or more of the following:
(a) Economy (b) Facility in printings (c) Ease in scoring and so on.
E. Different Forms of questions
In general, the questions are of the following two forms:
(1)   Free Response Type and (2) Fixed Response Type
1.   Free Response Questions: In a free response question, a student formulates
and organizes her own answer. These type of questions are very much in use in the
present system of examination. These are of two types, namely
29052014
(xii)
(a)  Long Answer Questions
A question which requires comparatively a lengthy answer is called a long answer
type question. These questions require the student to select relevant  facts, organise
them and write answers in her own words. In these type of questions, there is a very
little scope of guessing. However, if there are more number of long answer questions,
then the possibility of covering the whole content area in the examination will become
less. To overcome this difficulty, we may choose such long answer type questions
which involve more than one content areas.
(b)  Short Answer Questions
A question in which a student is expected to write the answer in 3 or 4 lines is called
a short answer type question. In these question, the coverage of content areas is more
specific and definite. It may be noted that a question whose answer may be a simple
diagram is also considered to be a short answer type question.
2.    Fixed Response Questions: In these type of questions, the answer is fixed and
definite. These type of question are being encouraged due to their objectivity in scoring.
They are also of two types, namely
(a)  Very Short Answer Questions
A question in which a student is expected to give the answer in just one word or a
phrase is called a very short answer type question. In mathematics, by a word or a
phrase, we generally mean a group of symbols or numbers (numerals). It is expected
to take 1 to 3 minutes to answer such a question. Fill in the blanks question is one of
the examples of such type of questions.
(b)  Objective Questions
An objective type question is one in which alternate answers are given and student
has to just indicate the correct answer. These questions can also be answered in just
1 to 3 minutes. They can be further classified into the following forms:
(i)   True-False Type: In these type of questions, a statement or formula is given and
the student is expected to write whether it is ‘True’ or ‘False’.
(ii)  Matching Type: These type of questions consist of two columns. The student
has to pair each item of first column with some item of the second column on the basis
of some criterion. The number of items in the second column may be more than that of
the first column.
(iii) Sentence Completion Type: In these type of questions, the student has to
complete the given sentence using one or more words given in brackets along with the
question.
(iv) Multiple Choice Type:  In these type of questions, number of alternatives (usually
called distracters), only one is appropriate or correct. The student is expected to write
or tick (ü) the correct alternative.
29052014
(xiii)
In the fixed response questions, the scope guess work is very high. However, this
can be minimised by attaching some element of reasoning in such questions. We may
call these questions as Short Answer Questions with Reasoning.
F. Instructional Objectives
As already stated, a question is said to be valid if it also based on a predetermined
objective. The world ‘objective’ is a tiered form. Objectives are divided into two groups,
namely (1) educational objectives and (2) instructional objectives. Educational objectives
play a directive role in the process of education, while instructional objectives are
those goals for the achievement of which all educational efforts are directed.
Mathematics is a special language with its own vocabulary and grammar. The
vocabulary consists of concepts, terms, facts, symbols, assumptions, etc., while the
grammar relates to principles, processes, functional relationships etc. Knowledge and
understanding of these and their applications to new situations have helped mankind to
achieve tremendous progress in various fields. Therefore, the main instructional
objectives for mathematics are as follows:
1.   Knowledge with Specifications
The students
recall or reproduce terms, facts, etc.
recognise terms, symbols, concepts, etc.
2.   Understanding with Specifications
The students
give illustrations for terms, definitions etc.
detect conceptual errors (and correct) in definitions, statements, formulae, etc.
compare concepts, quantities, etc.
discriminate between closely related concepts
translate verbal statements into mathematical statements and vice-versa
verify the results arrived at
classify data as per criteria
find relationships among the given data
interpret the data
3.   Application with Specification
analyse and find out what is given and what is required to be done
find out the adequecy, superflousity and relevancy of data
estabish relationship among the data
29052014
(xiv)
reason out deductively
select appropriate methods for solutions problems
suggest alternative methods for solving problems
generalise from particular situations
4.   Skill with Specifications
Carry out calculation easily and quickly
Handle geometrical instruments properly
Draw figure accurately and to the scale
Read tables and graphs properly
Interpret graphs correctly
As far as the main goal or objective in the NCF-2005 is concerned, it is to
develop abilities in the student for mathematisation. It also states (1) the narrow aims
of school mathematics, which concern with decimals and percents and (2) the higher
aims, which are for developing the child resources to think and reason mathematically,
to pursue assumption to their logical conclusions and to handle abstractions. Keeping
this in view, at this stage, the stress is only on the higher aims. These higher aims may
be considered as the instructional objectives. Objective based questions and objective
type questions are often confused with each other. When a question is framed keeping
a definite aim or objective in mind, it is called an objective based question, while if a
question is framed to measure the students achievement which is objective rather than
subjective is called objective type question. It may also be noted that determination
of the objective of a question varies from person to person. For example, a question
may appear to be of ‘knowledge’ type to one teacher who may think that the answer
of the question is known to the students, but the same question may appear to be of
understanding type to another teacher if she thinks that the question is completely
unknown to the same group of students. In the light of the views expressed in
NCF-2005, the following types of questions are suggested:
Long answer questions
Short answer questions
Short answer questions with reasoning
Multiple choice questions
It is hoped that these questions along with the questions in the textbook would
be effectively able to evaluate the Classes IX and X students in mathematics.

Check whether p(x) is a multiple of g(x) or not, where
p(x) = x3 – x + 1,   g(x) = 2 – 3x
Check whether g(x) is a factor of p(x) or not, where
p(x) = 8x3 – 6x2 – 4x + 3,   g(x) =
Solution :
p(x) will be a multiple of g(x) if g(x) divides p(x).
Now,      g(x) = 2 – 3x = 0 gives  x =

(Factor theorem)
29052014
EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
Since,

Sample Question 2 : Find the value of a, if x – a is a factor of x3 – ax2 + 2x + a – 1.
Solution : Let p(x) = x3 – ax2 + 2x + a – 1
Since x – a is a factor of p(x), so p(a) = 0.
i.e.,
a3 – a(a)2 + 2a + a – 1 = 0
a3 – a3 + 2a + a – 1 = 0
3a = 1
Therefore, a = 1
Sample Question 3 : (i)Without actually calculating the cubes, find the value of
483 – 303 – 183.
(ii)Without finding the cubes, factorise (x – y)3 + (y – z)3 + (z – x)3.
Solution : We know that x3 + y3 + z3 – 3xyz = (x + y + z) (x2 + y2 + z2 – xy – yz – zx).
If x + y + z = 0, then x3 + y3 + z3 – 3xyz = 0 or x3 + y3 + z3 = 3xyz.
We have to find the value of 483 – 303 – 183 = 483 + (–30)3 + (–18)3.
Here, 48 + (–30) + (–18) = 0
So, 483 + (–30)3 + (–18)3 = 3 × 48 × (–30) × (–18) = 77760
Here, (x – y) + (y – z) + (z – x) = 0
Therefore, (x – y)3 + (y – z)3 + (z – x)3 = 3(x – y) (y – z) (z – x).

(A) Main Concepts and Results
An equation is a statement  in which one expression equals to another expression. An
equation of the form ax + by + c = 0, where a, b and c are real numbers such that
a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0, is called a linear equation in two variables. The process of finding
solution(s) is called solving an equation.
The solution of a linear equation is not affected when
the same number is added to (subtracted from) both sides of the equation,
both sides of the equation are multiplied or divided by the same non-zero
number.
Further, a linear equation in two variables has infinitely many solutions. The graph of
every linear equation in two variables is a straight line and every point on the graph
(straight line) represents a solution of the linear equation. Thus, every solution of the
linear equation can be represented by a unique point on the graph of the equation. The
graphs of x = a and y = a are lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis, respectively.

(D) Short Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : Find the points where the graph of the equation 3x + 4y = 12
cuts the x-axis and the y-axis.
Solution : The graph of the linear equation 3x + 4y = 12 cuts the x-axis at the point
where y = 0. On putting y = 0 in the linear equation, we have 3x = 12, which gives
x = 4. Thus, the required point is (4, 0).
Fig. 4.2
29052014
EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
The graph of the linear equation 3x + 4y = 12 cuts the y-axis at the point where x = 0.
On putting x = 0 in the given equation, we have 4y = 12, which gives y = 3. Thus, the
required point is (0, 3).
Sample Question 2 : At what point does the graph of the linear equation x + y = 5
meet a line which is parallel to the  y-axis, at a distance 2 units from the origin and in the
positive direction of x-axis.
Solution : The coordinates of the points lying on the line parallel to the  y-axis, at a
distance 2 units from the origin and in the positive direction of the x-axis are of the form
(2, a). Putting x = 2, y = a in the equation x + y = 5, we get a = 3. Thus, the required
point is (2, 3).
Sample Question 3 : Determine the point on the graph of the equation 2x + 5y = 20
whose x-coordinate is
2  times its ordinate.
Solution : As the x-coordinate of the point is 5
2  times its ordinate, therefore, x = 5
Now putting x = 5
2 y in 2x + 5y = 20, we get, y = 2. Therefore, x = 5. Thus, the required
point is (5, 2).
Sample Question 4 : Draw the graph of the equation
represented by the straight line which is parallel to the
x-axis and is 4 units above it.
Solution : Any straight line parallel to x-axis is given by
y = k, where k is the distance of the line from the x-axis.
Here k = 4. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = 4.
To draw the graph of this equation, plot the points (1, 4)
and (2, 4) and join them. This is the required graph
(see Fig. 4.3).

(E) Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : Draw the graph of the linear equation 2x + 3y = 12. At what
points, the graph of the equation cuts the x-axis and the  y-axis?
Solution : The given equation is 2x + 3y = 12. To draw the graph of this equation, we
need at least two points lying on the graph.
From the equation, we have y =  12 2
For x = 0, y = 4, therefore, (0, 4) lies on the graph.
For y = 0, x = 6, therefore, (6, 0) lies on the graph.
Now plot the points A (0, 4) and B (6, 0) and
join them (see Fig 4.4), to get the line AB.
Line AB is the required graph.
You can see that the graph (line AB) cuts
the x-axis at the point (6, 0) and the y-axis at
the point (0, 4).

Draw the graph, using the values of x, y as given in the above table.

cuts the y-axis.
Solution : From the table, we get two points
A (1, 1) and B (2, 3) which lie on the graph of the
linear equation. Obviously, the graph will be a
straight line. So, we first plot the points A and B
and join them as shown in the Fig 4.5.
From the Fig 4.5, we see that the graph cuts the
x-axis at the point
1 , 0
 and the y-axis at the
point (0, –1).
Sample Question 3 : The Autorikshaw fare
in a city is charged Rs 10 for the first kilometer
and @ Rs 4 per kilometer for subsequent
distance covered. Write the linear equation to
express the above statement. Draw the graph
of the linear equation.
Solution : Let the total distance covered be
x km and the fare charged Rs y. Then for the
first km, fare charged is Rs 10 and for
remaining (x –1) km fare charged is
Rs 4 (x – 1).
Therefore, y = 10 + 4(x – 1) = 4x + 6
The required equation is y = 4x + 6. Now, when
x = 0, y = 6 and when x = –1, y = 2. The graph
is given in Fig 4.6.
Sample Question 4 : The work done by a body on application of a constant force is
the product of the constant force and the distance travelled by the body in the direction

29052014
LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
graph by taking the constant force as 3 units. What is the work done when the distance
travelled is 2 units. Verify it by plotting the graph.
Solution: Work done = (constant force) × (distance)
= 3 × (distance),
i.e., y = 3x, where y (units) is the work done and
x (units) is the distance travelled. Since x = 2 units
(given), therefore, work done = 6 units. To plot
the graph of the linear equation y = 3x, we need at
least two solutions of the equation. We see that
x = 0, y = 0 satisfies the given equation also x = 1,
y = 3 satisfies the equation.
Now we plot the points A (0, 0) and B (1, 3) and
join AB (see Fig. 4.7). The graph of the equation
is a straight line. [We have not shown the whole
line because work done cannot be negative].
To verify from the graph, draw a perpendicular to
the x-axis at the point (2, 0) meeting the graph at
the point C. Clearly the coordinates of C are
(2, 6). It means that the work done is 6 units.
EXERCISE 4.4

Ancient India
The geometry of the Vedic period originated with the construction of altars (or
vedis) and fireplaces for performing Vedic rites. Square and circular altars were
used for household rituals, while altars, whose shapes were combinations of
rectangles, triangles and trapeziums, were required for public worship.
Egypt, Babylonia and Greece
Egyptians developed a number of geometric techniques and rules for calculating
simple areas and doing simple constructions. Babylonians and Egyptains used
geometry mostly for practical purposes and did very little to develop it as a systematic
science. The Greeks were interested in establishing the truth of the statements
they discovered using deductive reasoning. A Greek mathematician, Thales is
credited with giving the first known proof.
Euclid’s Elements
Euclid around 300 B.C. collected all known work in the field of mathematics and
arranged it in his famous treatise called Elements. Euclid assumed certain properties,
which were not to be proved. These assumptions are actually “obvious universal
truths”. He divided them into two types.

EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
(i) Pyramid is a solid figure, the base of which is a triangle or square or some other
polygon and its side faces are equilateral triangles that converges to a point at the
(ii) In Vedic period, squares and circular shaped altars were used for household rituals,
while altars whose shapes were combination of rectangles, triangles and trapeziums
were used for public worship.
(iii) In geometry, we take a point, a line and a plane as undefined terms.
(iv) If the area of a triangle equals the area of a rectangle and the area of the rectangle
equals that of a square, then the area of the triangle also equals the area of the
square.
(v) Euclid’s fourth axiom says that everything equals itself.
(vi) The Euclidean geometry is valid only for figures in the plane.
Solution :
(i) False. The side faces of a pyramid are triangles not necessarily equilateral triangles.
(ii) True. The geometry of Vedic period originated with the construction of vedis and
fireplaces for performing vedic rites. The location of the sacred fires had to be in
accordance to the clearly laid down instructions about their shapes and area.
(iii) True. To define a point, a line and a plane in geometry we need to define many
other things that give a long chain of definitions without an end. For such reasons,
mathematicians agree to leave these geometric terms undefined.
(iv) True. Things equal to the same thing are equal.
(v) True. It is the justification of the principle of superposition.
(vi) True. It fails on the curved surfaces. For example on curved surfaces, the sum of
angles of a triangle may be more than 180°.

INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID’S GEOMETRY
“For every line l and for every point P not lying on a given line l, there exists a
unique line m passing through P and parallel to l ” is known as Playfair’s axiom.
Two distinct intersecting lines cannot be parallel to the same line.
Attempts to prove Euclid’s fifth postulate using the other postulates and axioms led
to the discovery of several other geometries.
(D) Short Answer Questions
Sample Question  1 : Ram and Ravi have the same weight. If they each gain weight
by 2 kg, how will their new weights be compared ?
Solution : Let x kg be the weight each of Ram and  Ravi. On gaining 2 kg, weight of
Ram and Ravi will be (x + 2) each. According to Euclid’s second axiom, when equals
are added to equals, the wholes are equal. So, weight of Ram and Ravi are again equal.
Sample Question 2 : Solve the equation a – 15 = 25 and state which axiom do you
use here.
Solution : a – 15 = 25. On adding 15 to both sides, we have  a – 15 + 15 = 25 + 15 = 40
(using Euclid’s second axiom).
a = 40
Sample Question 3 : In the Fig. 5.1, if
∠1 = ∠3, ∠2 = ∠4      and  ∠3 = ∠4,
write the relation between ∠1 and ∠2, using an
Euclid’s axiom.
Solution : Here, ∠3 = ∠4, ∠1 = ∠3 and
∠2 = ∠4. Euclid’s first axiom says, the things
which are equal to equal thing are equal to one
aother.
So, ∠1 = ∠2.
Sample Question 4 : In Fig. 5.2, we
have :  AC = XD, C is the mid-point of
AB and D is the mid-point of  XY. Using
an Euclid’s axiom, show that AB = XY.
Solution :
AB = 2AC (C is the mid-point of AB)
XY = 2XD (D is the mid-point of XY)
Also,  AC = XD (Given)

Sample Question 1 :
Let OA, OB, OC and OD are rays in the anticlockwise direction such that ∠ AOB =
∠COD = 100°, ∠BOC = 82° and  ∠AOD = 78°. Is it true to say that AOC and BOD

(E) Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1: In Fig. 7.9, ABC is a right triangle and right
angled at B such that ∠BCA = 2 ∠BAC. Show that
hypotenuse AC = 2 BC.
Solution: Produce CB to a point D such that BC = BD
and join AD.
In ∆ ABC and ∆ ABD, we have
BC = BD
(By construction)
AB = AB
(Same side)
∠ABC = ∠ABD
(Each of 90°)
Therefore,
∆ ABC ≅∆ ABD
(SAS)
∠CAB = ∠DAB
AC = AD
Thus,
∠CAD = ∠CAB + ∠BAD = x + x = 2x   [From (1)]
∠ACD = ∠ADB = 2x
[From (2), AC = AD]
That is, ∆ ACD is an equilateral triangle. [From (3) and (4)]
AC = CD, i.e.,  AC = 2 BC  (Since BC = BD)
Sample Question 2 : Prove that if in two triangles two angles and the included side of
one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of the other triangle, then the
two triangles are congruent.

also bisects the opposite side, prove that the triangle is isosceles.
Solution : We are given a point D on side BC of a ∆ ABC such
that ∠BAD = ∠CAD and BD = CD (see Fig. 7.10). We are to
prove that AB = AC.
Produce AD to a point E such that AD = DE and then join CE.

(SAS)
AB = EC
∠BAD = ∠CED
Also,
∠BAD = ∠CAD
(Given)
Therefore,
∠CAD = ∠CED
[From (2)]
AC = EC
[Sides opposite the equal angles]
Therefore,
AB = AC
[From (1) and (3)]
Sample Question 4 : S is any point in the interior of ∆ PQR. Show that SQ + SR <
PQ + PR.
Solution : Produce QS to intersect PR at T (See Fig. 7.11).
From  ∆ PQT, we have
PQ + PT > QT(Sum of any two sides is greater than
the third side)
i.e.,
PQ + PT > SQ + ST
From ∆ TSR, we have
ST + TR > SR
Adding (1) and (2), we get
PQ + PT + ST + TR > SQ + ST + SR
i.e.,
PQ + PT + TR > SQ + SR
i.e.,
PQ + PR > SQ + SR
SQ + SR < PQ + PR

Solution : Let the angles of the quadrilateral be 3x, 4x, 4x and 7x.
3x + 4x + 4x + 7x = 360º
18x = 360º, i.e., x = 20º

Therefore,
∠RPQ + ∠PQS = 180º
(Interior angles on the same side of the transversal)
i.e.,
∠RPQ + ∠PQM + ∠MQS = 180º
Also,
PN || QM  (By construction)
Therefore,
∠NPQ + ∠PQM = 180º
i.e.,
∠NPR + ∠RPQ + ∠PQM = 180º
∠NPR = ∠MQS [From (2) and (3)]

Also,AC ⊥ BD (Diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular)
Further
PQ || AC (From ∆BAC)

AB || CD and AC is a transversal.
Therefore,
∠BAC = ∠DCA (Alternate angles)
Similarly,
∠DAC = ∠BCA (From AD || BC)
But it is given that
∠BAC =  ∠DAC
Therefore, from (1), (2) and (3), we have

(E)  Long Answer Questions
Sample Question 1 : Prove that two circles cannot intersect at more than two points.
Solution :  Let there be two circles which intersect at three points say at A, B and C.
Clearly, A, B and C are not collinear. We know that through three non-collinear points
A, B and C one and only one circle can pass. Therefore, there cannot be two circles
passing through A, B and C. In other words, the two circles cannot intersect at more
than two points.
Sample Question 2 :  Prove that among all the chords of a circle passing through a
given point inside the circle that one is smallest which is perpendicular to the diameter
passing through the point.
Solution : Let P be the given point inside a circle
with centre O. Draw the chord AB which is
perpendicular to the diameter XY through P. Let CD
be any other chord through P. Draw ON perpendicular
to CD from O. Then ∆ONP is a right triangle
(Fig.10.17). Therefore, its hypotenuse OP is larger
than ON. We know that the chord nearer to the centre
is larger than the chord which is farther to the centre.
Therefore, CD > AB. In other words, AB is the
smallest of all chords passing through P.

(C) Short Answer Questions with Reasoning
Sample Question 1 : The mean of the data :
2, 8, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 6, 4, 9, 1, 5, 6, 5
is given to be 5. Based on this information, is it correct to say that the mean of the data:
10, 12, 10, 2, 18, 8, 12, 6, 12, 10, 8, 10, 12, 16, 4
is 10? Give reason.
Solution : It is correct. Since the 2nd data is obtained by multiplying each observation
of 1st data by 2, therefore, the mean will be 2 times the mean of the 1st data.
Sample Question 2 : In a histogram, the areas of the rectangles are proportional to
the frequencies. Can we say that the lengths of the rectangles are also proportional to
the frequencies?
Solution: No. It is true only when the class sizes are the same.
Sample Quetion 3 : Consider the data : 2, 3, 9, 16, 9, 3, 9. Since 16 is the highest value
in the observations, is it correct to say that it is the mode of the data? Give reason.
Solution : 16 is not the mode of the data. The mode of a given data is the observation
with highest frequency and not the observation with  highest value.

Sample Question 2 : The following observations are arranged in ascending order :
26, 29, 42, 53, x, x + 2, 70, 75, 82, 93
If the median is 65, find the value of x.
Solution : Number of observations (n) = 10, which is even. Therefore, median is the
mean of
 and
observation, i.e., 5th and 6th observation.
Here,
5th observation = x
6th observation = x + 2
Median =
x + 1 = 65 (Given)
Therefore,
x = 64
Thus, the value of x is 64.
Sample Question 3 : Here is an extract from a mortality table.

11490
Based on this information, what is the probability of a person ‘aged 60’ of
dying within a year?
What is the probability that a person ‘aged 61’ will live for 4 years?
Solution :
We see that 16090 persons aged 60, (16090-11490), i.e., 4600 died before
reaching their 61st birthday.
Therefore, P(a person aged 60 die within a year) = 4600
16090  = 460
29052014
EXEMPLAR PROBLEMS
Number of persons aged 61 years = 11490
Number of persons surviving for 4 years = 2320
P(a person aged 61 will live for 4 years) = 2320
