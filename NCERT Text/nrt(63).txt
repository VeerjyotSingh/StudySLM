FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that
children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning,
which continues to shape our system, and causes a gap between the
school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea.
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-
centered system of education outlined in the National Policy on
Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals
and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own
learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must
recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new
knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by
adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites
of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as
receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode
of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as
rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods
used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this
textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have
tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring
and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook
attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space
to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training
(NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson
of the advisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the
secondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for
this book, Professor Tapas Majumdar for guiding the work of this
committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this

textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible.
We are indebted to the institutions and organisations, which have
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National
Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary
and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development
under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P.
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an
organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous
improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision
and refinement.

A FEW INTRODUCTORY WORDS FOR TEACHERS
This book introduces you to a simplified view of the process of development in
the Indian economy. In Economics, we usually try to look at development as a
process of change in the economic life of the people, as producers or consumers
of goods and services. Sometimes, development is studied mainly as a
phenomenon that acquired significance only with the growth of the modern
industrial civilisation. This is because the state of development (or
underdevelopment) of a country has often depended on outcomes of wars and
conquests and on colonial exploitation of one country by another. However, in
this book, we have not emphasised on the external factors. We have taken a
long view of the process of development: a process that could have started
before any external factors intervened or interrupted it. The process of
development may also restart after such interruptions, and continue on
independent lines after the period of subjugation ends. This has happened in
the case of our own country, India.
In this book the first beginnings of development are seen in terms of the
emergence of agriculture, manufacturing and services as three distinct sectors
of the economy. We have also tried to look at economic development not in
isolation but as part of a more general concept of human development that
includes the development of health and education and other indicators that,
along with income, broadly define the quality of life of a people.
In the first chapter, we will study how people actually perceive development
and how it can be measured. There are various measures available for this
purpose. We will look at the extent to which some of the important developmental
indicators help in understanding development and how the process may affect
different people differently.
Development as a process had probably started quite early in history. To
begin with, perhaps no country could be distinguished as developed in the
sense that we understand development. Perhaps the process would have started
in most human settlements when people started living in relative peace and in
more or less fixed habitations without which agriculture would not have been
possible on any significant scale. Once agriculture began and developed, the
extraction of other natural products, like mineral ores, probably was started.
This latter process of recovering stones and other minerals is called ‘quarrying’.
Humans learnt to use the non-food products like wood from trees and the
minerals obtained from quarrying as raw materials for making their tools,
weapons, utensils, fishing nets and so on. These were the first human-made
products called ‘artefacts’. Economists called the process of making the artefacts
‘manufacture’ as distinguished from ‘agriculture (including quarrying)’ that
covered the gathering, cultivating or extracting of purely natural products such
as fruit, rice or minerals.
The separation of productive activities between the two distinct sectors of
agriculture including quarrying (also called the Primary Sector) and
© NCERT
not to be republished
manufacture (also called the Secondary Sector) was probably the first visible
manifestation of economic development. This separation came about through
the process of “division of labour” as Adam Smith, regarded as the father of
economics had called it. The process is briefly explained below.
At first every person, or at least members of every household, presumably,
had to do everything all by themselves. Then at some point the advantage of
‘division of labour’ must have been felt. Humans found out with experience
that production became more efficient if some people concentrated on learning
how to fish, others on how to till the soil, still others on how to produce
pottery, or trap or hunt animals and birds for food and so on. This was also
‘development’ of a kind. Then there emerged specialists who were not
themselves producing any good at all: they were people specialising in
teaching others how to do these things better. There were also doctors who
healed people when they were injured or had fallen ill. Naturally division of
labour between people increased the productivity of all the people and the
economy grew.
The second chapter will look at the way economic activities in a modern
economy can be classified and understood within the framework of primary,
secondary and tertiary sectors. The discussion here is focussed on India and
the changes that have occurred in the three sectors over the past decades. Besides
this, it also provides two other ways of classifying economic activities — organised
and unorganised, and private and public sectors. The relevance of additional
ways of classification for understanding the problems and challenges of the
modern Indian economy is illustrated using real life examples and case studies.
The third chapter initiates the learners into the world of money — its role in
a modern economy, forms and its linkage with various institutions such as
banks. Then the chapter moves on to discuss the role of banks and other
institutions in providing credit to the people. Issues stressed in the discussion
on credit are (a) pervasiveness of credit in economic life across a very large
section of the population (b) the preponderance of informal credit in India and
(c) role of credit in creating either a self-sustaining virtuous cycle of productive
investment, higher income streams, higher standards of living leading to more
productive investments contributing to development, or a vicious cycle of
indebtedness, poverty and debt-trap leading to increased poverty. These ideas
are presented through case studies.
Globalisation is an important phenomenon, which has influenced
development and people around the world in various ways. The fourth chapter
focuses on a particular dimension of globalisation that is economic in nature
— the complex organisation of production. How multinational companies
facilitate globalisation through trade and investment is also explained. Some
important factors and institutions that facilitate globalisation also find place
in this chapter. In the end, the chapter appraises the impacts of globalisation
(positive and negative) on the Indian economy.
The process of development leads to not only higher levels of production in
different sectors of the economy, but has some down sides too. The examples
and case studies in this chapter and elsewhere try to examine whether the
benefits of development are spreading to all people (producers big and small,
workers in the organised or unorganised sectors, consumers belonging to all
Labour is the
source of all
wealth

(vii)
income groups, men and women and so on) or are being confined to only some
privileged sections.
Our final chapter presents a relevant study of how, and to what extent, we
can protect the rights of citizens as consumers. During the process of rapid
development and emergence of new brands and advertisement campaigns by
unscrupulous producers, consumers are often at the receiving end of business
malpractices. After tracing the historical root of the consumer movement and
through various real-life instances, this chapter tells of different inexpensive
consumer protection mechanisms evolved over the years. It also offers details
of how people can now assert some of their rights at very little expense at the
special consumer courts that operate outside the existing cumbersome,
expensive and time-consuming legal procedures.
Features of this Textbook
The purpose of the book is to understand the economic life around us and
also to think about what we would mean by economic development for people.
There are many examples and case-studies that we have used both as an
aid for conceptual clarity and to relate these ideas to real life. These have  to
be read and used keeping this overall objective in view.
The chapters start with Note for the teacher. Teachers could read this page
before they start teaching a chapter. It contains the details of (i) the broad approach
and content of the chapter; (ii) some pointers to how the chapter could be taught;
and (iii) sources for additional details relating to different topics.
There are several internal exercises in Let’s work this out, given after
each section in the chapters. This contains a few questions to review the section
and open-ended questions and activities that can be taken up within and
outside the classroom. Some of the internal exercises should be done in the
discussion mode. Students can discuss these in groups and present their
conclusions and the answers may be put up for debate with the entire class.
This will require more time but it is essential as this allows students to
explore and learn from each other. The intention is to allow for more
interaction than is usually observed but there is no fixed formula for doing
this. Each teacher would find his or her own ways and we would like to
express our faith in their abilities to do so.
We have used many reference materials while preparing this book.
Besides these, many news clippings, reports from government and
non-government organisations were also used. Some of them are mentioned
in the Note for the teacher and some in Suggested Readings given at
the end of this book.
It is important that additional information and readings be brought
into classroom discussion. This could be in the form of short surveys, interviews
with people around, reference books, or newspaper clippings etc. These should
then be used for reflection and creative expression by students themselves in
the form of making charts, wallpaper displays, skits, debates etc.

Examination Reforms call for a change in the way questions are asked in
examinations. The questions asked in this book make a departure from an
evaluation pattern that encourages rote-memorisation to one that inculcates
creative thinking, imagination, reflection and hones the analytical ability of
learners. Based on the examples shown here, teachers can formulate additional
questions.
Questions that test the understanding of core concepts
(a) GDP is the total value of _________ produced during a particular year.
(i) all goods and services
(ii) all final goods and services
(iii) all intermediate goods and services
(iv) all intermediate and final goods and services
(b) Analyse the role of credit for development.
(c) In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to interlinking
of production?
(d) How would flexibility in labour laws help companies?
Questions to assess analytical abilities, interpretation and coherent
presentation
(a) The following table gives the GDP in Rupees (crores) by the three secors:
primary
secondary
tertiary
80,000
19,000
39,000
3,14,000
2,80,000
5,55,000
Calculate the share of the three sectors in GDP for 1950 and 2000.
Show the data as a bar diagram similar to Graph 2 in the chapter 2.
(iii)
What conclusions can we draw from the bar graph?
(b) In India, about 80 per cent of farmers are small farmers, who need credit for
cultivation.
Why might banks be unwilling to lend to small farmers?
What are the other sources from which small farmers can borrow?
(iii)
Explain with an example how the terms of credit can be unfavourable for
the small farmer.
Suggest some ways by which small farmers can get cheap credit.
Questions to test reflective thinking
(a) Look at the picture (high rise buildings with slums around). What should be the
developmental goals for such an area?
© NCERT
not to be republished
(b) “The Earth has enough resources to meet the needs of all but not enough to satisfy
the greed of even one person”. How is this statement relevant to the discussion of
development? Discuss.
(c) “Tertiary sector is not playing any significant role in the development of Indian
economy”. Do you agree? Give reasons in support of your answer.
(d) People make complaints about the lack of civic amenities such as bad roads or
poor water and health facilities but no one listens. Now the RTI Act gives you the
power to question. Do you agree? Discuss.
Questions that test the ability to apply concepts and ideas to real life
problems / situations
(a) What can be some of the developmental goals for your village, town or locality?
(b) Students in a school are often classified into primary and secondary or junior and
senior. What is the criterion used here? Do you think this is useful classification?
(c) In what ways can employment be increased in urban areas?
(d) What do you understand by disguised unemployment? Explain with an example
each from the urban and rural areas.
(e) Describe some of your duties as consumers if you visit a shopping complex in
your locality.
It is also necessary to develop questions that require students to draw from
one or more areas of the syllabus for making relevant connections between
materials from different chapters. For instance, in Chapter 4 one question links
to Chapter 1— In chapter 1, we saw what may be development for one may
be destructive for others. The setting of SEZs has been opposed by some
people in India. Find out who are these people and why are they opposing it.
We hope that you along with your students would look at this textbook
itself in a critical manner and send us your critique, questions, clarification,
etc. to the following address. AND we could continue this discussion further.

NOTES FOR TEACHERS
NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER I : DEVELOPMENT
Development has many aspects. The
purpose of this chapter is to enable
students to understand this idea. They
have to understand that people have
different perspectives on development and
there are ways by which we can arrive at
common indicators for development. To
do this, we have used situations that they
can respond to in an intuitive manner; we
have also presented analysis that is more
complex and macro in nature.
How can countries or states be
compared
using
selected
development indicators is another
question that students would read about
in this chapter. Economic development
can be measured and income is the most
common method for measuring
development. However, the income
method, though useful, has several
weaknesses. Hence, we need newer ways
of looking at development using indicators
of quality of life and environmental
sustainability.
It is necessary for you to expect the
students to respond actively in the
classroom and on a topic such as the
above, there would be wide variation in
opinion and possibility of debate. Allow
students to argue their point of view. At
the end of each section there are a few
questions and activities. These serve two
purposes: first, they recap the ideas
discussed in the section and second, they
enable better understanding of the themes
discussed by bringing the learners closer
to their real-life situations.
There are certain terms used in this
chapter that would require clarification —
Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant
Mortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life
Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and
Human Development Index. Though data
pertaining to these terms are provided,
these would need further explanation. You
may also need to clarify the concept of
purchasing power parity that is used to
calculate per capita income in Table 1.6.
It is necessary to keep in mind that these
terms are used as an aid to the discussion
and not something to be memorised.
Sources for Information
The data for this chapter is taken from
reports published by the Government of
India (Economic Survey), United Nations
Development
Programme
(Human
Development Report) and World Bank
(World Development Indicators). These
reports are being published every year. It
may be interesting to look up these reports
if they are available in your school library.
If not, you may log on to the websites of
these institutions (www.budgetindia.nic.in,
www.undp.org, www.worldbank.org).
Data is also available from the Reserve
Bank’s Handbook of Statistics on Indian
Economy, available at www.rbi.org).

The idea of development or progress
has always been with us. We have
aspirations or desires about what we
would like to do and how we would
like to live. Similarly, we have ideas
about what a country should be like.
What are the essential things that we
require? Can life be better for all? How
should people live together? Can there
be more equality? Development
involves thinking about these
questions and about the ways in
which we can work towards achieving
these goals. This is a complex
task and in this chapter we shall
make a beginning at understanding
development. You will learn more
about these issues in greater depth
in higher classes. Also, you will find
answers to many of these questions
not just in economics but also in your
course in history and political science.
This is because the way we live today
is influenced by the past. We can’t
desire for change without being aware
of this. In the same way, it is only
through a democratic political
process that these hopes and
possibilities can be achieved in
real life.

Let us try to imagine what
development or progress is likely to
mean to different persons listed in
Table 1.1. What are their aspirations?
You will find that some columns are
partially filled. Try to complete the
table. You can also add any other
category of persons.
Category of Person
Landless rural labourers
Prosperous farmers from Punjab
Farmers who depend only on
rain for growing crops
A rural woman from a land
owning family
Urban unemployed youth
A boy from a rich urban family
A girl from a rich urban family
An adivasi from Narmada valley
WHAT DEVELOPMENT PROMISES —
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT GOALS
Having filled Table 1.1, let us now
examine it. Do all of these persons
have the same notion of development
or progress? Most likely not.  Each
one of them seeks different things.
They seek things that are most
important for them, i.e., that which
can fulfil their aspirations or desires.
In fact, at times, two persons or
groups of persons may seek things
TABLE 1.1 DEVELOPMENTAL GOALS OF DIFFERENT
CATEGORIES OF PERSONS
Developmental Goals / Aspirations
More days of work and better wages; local school is able to

discrimination and they too can become leaders in the village.
Assured a high family income through higher support prices for

which are conflicting.  A girl expects
as much freedom and opportunity as
her brother, and that he also shares
in the household work. Her brother
may not like this.  Similarly, to get
more electricity, industrialists may
want more dams.  But this may
submerge the land and disrupt the
lives of people who are displaced – such
as tribals. They might resent this and
may prefer small check dams or tanks
to irrigate their land.
So, two things are quite clear: one,
different persons can have
different developmental goals and
two, what may be development for
one may not be development for
the other. It may even be
destructive for the other.

INCOME AND OTHER GOALS
If you go over Table 1.1 again, you
will notice one common thing: what
people desire are regular work, better
wages, and decent price for their crops
or other products that they produce.
In other words, they want more
income.
Besides seeking more income, one-
way or the other, people also seek
things like equal treatment, freedom,
security, and respect of others. They
resent discrimination. All these are
important goals. In fact, in some cases,
these may be more important than
more income or more consumption
because material goods are not all
that you need to live.
Money, or material things that one
can buy with it, is one factor on which
our life depends. But the quality of our
life also depends on non-material
things mentioned above.  If it is not
obvious to you, then just think of the
role of your friends in your life. You
may desire their friendship.  Similarly,
there are many things that are not
easily measured but they mean a lot
to our lives. These are often ignored.

1.  Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following
explanations is more important and why?
Because people are different.
Because life situations of persons are different.
2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer.
People have different developmental goals.
People have conflicting developmental goals.
3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives.
4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
However, it will be wrong to conclude
that what cannot be measured is not
important.
Consider another example. If you
get a job in a far off place, before
accepting it you would try to consider
many factors, apart from income,
such as facilities for your family,
working atmosphere, or opportunity
to learn. In another case, a job may
give you less pay but may offer regular
employment that enhances your
sense of security. Another job,
however, may offer high pay but no
job security and also leave no time for
your family. This will reduce your
sense of security and freedom.
Similarly, for development,
people look at a mix of goals. It is
true that if women are engaged in paid
work, their dignity in the household
and society increases. However, it is
also the case that if there is respect
for women there would be more
sharing of housework and a
greater acceptance of women
working outside. A safe and secure
environment may allow more women
to take up a variety of jobs or run
a business.
Hence, the developmental goals
that people have are not only about
better income but also about other
important things in life.
If, as we have seen above, individuals
seek different goals, then their notion
of national development is also likely
to be different. Discuss among
yourselves on what India should do
for development.
Most likely, you would find that
different students in the class have given
different answers to the above question.
In fact, you might yourself think of
many different answers and not be too
sure of any of these. It is very
important to keep in mind that
different persons could have
different as well as conflicting
notions of a country’s development.
However, can all the ideas be
considered equally important? Or, if
there are conflicts how does one
decide? What would be a fair and just
path for all?  We also have to think
whether there is a better way of doing
things. Would the idea benefit a large
number of people or only a small
group?  National development means
thinking about these questions.

You might ask — if development can
mean different things, how come some
countries are generally called
developed and others under -
developed?  Before we come to this,
let us consider another question.
When we compare different things,
they could have similarities as well as
differences. Which aspects do we use
to compare them? Let us look at
students in the class itself.  How do
we compare different students?  They
differ in their height, health, talents
and interests. The healthiest student
may not be the most studious one.
The most intelligent student may not
be the friendliest one.  So, how do we
compare students? The criterion we
may use depends on the purpose of
comparison.  We use different criterion
to choose a sports team, a debate
team, a music team or a team to
organise a picnic.  Still, if for some
purpose, we have to choose the
criterion for the all-round progress of
children in the class, how shall we
do it?
Usually we take one or more
important characteristics of
persons and compare them based
on these characteristics.  Of
course, there can be differences about
what are important characteristics
that should form the basis of
comparison: friendliness and spirit of
cooperation, creativity or marks
secured?
This is true of development too.
For comparing countries, their
income is considered to be one of
the most important attributes.
Countries with higher income are
more developed than others with less
income. This is based on the
understanding that more income
means more of all things that human
beings need.  Whatever people like,
and should have, they will be able to
get with greater income. So, greater
income itself is considered to be one
important goal.
Now, what is the income of a
country? Intuitively, the income of the
country is the income of all the
residents of the country.  This gives
us the total income of the country.
However, for comparison between
countries, total income is not such an
useful measure. Since, countries have
different populations, comparing total
income will not tell us what an average
person is likely to earn. Are people in
one country better off than others in a
different country? Hence, we compare
the average income which is the total
income of the country divided by its
total population. The average income
is also called per capita income.
In World Development Reports,
brought out by the World Bank, this
criterion is used in classifying
countries. Countries with per capita
income of US$ 12616 per annum and
above in 2012, are called rich countries
and those with per capita income of
US$ 1035 or less are called low-income
countries. India comes in the category
of low middle income countries
because its per capita income in 2012
was just US$ 1530 per annum. The
rich countries, excluding countries of
Middle East and certain other small
countries, are generally called
developed countries.

assured of being its fifth citizen
but if it is a lottery that decides
our citizenship number then
perhaps most of us will prefer to
live in country A. Even though
both the countries have identical
average income, country A is
preferred because it has more
equitable distribution.  In this
country people are neither very
rich nor extremely poor. On the
other hand most citizens in
country B are poor and one
person is extremely rich. Hence,
while average income is useful
for comparison it does not tell us
how this income is distributed
among people.
1. Give three examples where an average is used for comparing situations.
2. Why do you think average income is an important criterion for development? Explain.
3. Besides size of per capita income, what other property of income is important in
comparing two or more societies?
4. Suppose records show that the average income in a country has been increasing
over a period of time. From this, can we conclude that all sections of the economy
have become better? Illustrate your answer with an example.

When we looked at individual
aspirations and goals, we
found that people not only
think of better income but
also have goals such as

equal treatment, freedom, etc.
in mind. Similarly, when we
think of a nation or a region,
we may, besides average
income, think of other equally
important attributes.
INCOME AND OTHER CRITERIA
What could these attributes be?
Let us examine this through an
example. Table 1.3 gives the per capita
income of Maharashtra, Kerala  and
Bihar.  Actually, these figures are of
Per Capita Net State Domestic Product
at Current Prices for 2012–13. Let us
ignore what this complicated term
exactly means. Roughly we can take
it to be per capita income of the state.
We find that of the three, Maharashtra
has the highest per capita income and

Bihar is at the bottom. This means
that, on an average, a person in
Maharashtra earned  Rs 1,07,670 in
one year whereas, on an average, a
person in Bihar would earn only
around Rs 28,774. So, if per capita
income were to be used as the
measure of development, Maharashtra
will be considered the most developed
and Bihar the least developed state of
the three. Now, let us look at certain
other data pertaining to these states
given in Table 1.4.

Explanation of some of the terms used in this table:
Infant Mortality Rate (or IMR) indicates the number of children that die before the age of  one  year
as a proportion of 100 live children born in that particular year.
Literacy Rate measures the proportion of literate population in the 7 and above age group.
Net Attendance Ratio is the total number of children of age group 14 and 15 years attending school
as a percentage of total number of children in the same age group.

D EVELOPMENT

PUBLIC FACILITIES
What does this table show?  The
first column of the table shows that in
Kerala, out of 1000 children born, 12
died before completing one year of age
but in Maharashtra the proportion of
children dying within one year of birth
is 25, which is more than double. On
the other hand, the per capita income
of Maharashtra is more than that of
Kerala as shown in Table 1.3. Just
think of how dear you are to your
parents, think of how every one is so
happy when a child it born.  Now, try
to think of parents whose children die
before they even celebrate their first
birthday. How painful it must be to
these parents?  Next, note the year to
which this data pertains. It is 2012.
So we are not talking of old times; it is
more than 65 years after independence
when our metro towns are full of high
rise buildings and shopping malls!
How is it that the average person in
Maharashtra has more income than
the average person in Kerala but lags
behind in these crucial areas? The
reason is — money in your pocket
cannot buy all the goods and
services that you may need to live
well.  So, income by itself is not a
completely adequate indicator of
material goods and services that
citizens are able to use.  For example,
normally, your money cannot buy
you a pollution-free environment or
ensure that you get unadulterated
medicines, unless you can afford to
shift to a community that already has
all these things.  Money may also not
be able to protect you from infectious
diseases, unless the whole of your
community takes preventive steps.
The problem does not end with
Infant Mortality Rate. The last column
of table 1.4 shows around two-thirds
of children aged 14-15 in Bihar are
not attending school beyond Class 8.
This means that if you went to school
in Bihar more than two-thirds of your
class would be missing. Those who
could have been in school are not
there! If this had happened to you,
you would not be able to read what
you are reading now.
Actually for many of the important
things in life the best way, also the
cheapest way, is to provide these goods
and services collectively. Just think –
will it be cheaper to have collective
security for the whole locality or for
each house to have its own security
man?  What if no one, other than you,
in your village or locality is interested
in studying? Would you be able to
study? Not unless your parents could
afford to send you to some private
school elsewhere.  So you are actually
able to study because many other
children also want to study and
because many people believe that the
government should open schools and
provide other facilities so that all
children have a chance to study. Even
now, in many areas, children,
particularly girls, are not able to
achieve secondary level schooling
because government/society has not
provided adequate facilities.

The literacy rate for all age groups, including young and old, is _____ for rural

adults could not attend school but that there are _____ who are currently not in
school.
(b) It is clear from the table that _____ % of rural girls and _____% of rural boys are
not attending school. Therefore, illiteracy among children in the age group 10-
14 is as high as _____% for rural females and _____% for rural males.
(c) This high level of illiteracy among __________ age group, even after more than
60 years of our independence, is most disturbing.  In many other states also
we are nowhere near realisation of the constitutional goal of free and compulsory
education for all children up to the age of 14, which was expected to be achieved
by 1960.
Study Table 1.5 carefully and fill in the blanks in the following paragraphs.  For this,
you may need to make calculations based on the table.
1. Look at data in Table 1.3 and 1.4. Is Maharashtra ahead of
Bihar in literacy rate etc. as it is in terms of per capita income?
2. Think of other examples where collective provision of goods
and services is cheaper than individual provision.
3. Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend
only on amount of money spent by the government on these
facilities? What other factors could be relevant?
4. In Tamil Nadu, 75 per cent of the people living in rural areas use
a ration shop, whereas in Jharkhand only 8 per cent of rural
people do so. Where would people be better off and why?

Once it is realised that even though
the level of income is important, yet
it is an inadequate measure of the
level of development, we begin to
think of other criterion. There could
be a long list of such criterion but
then it would not be so useful. What
we need is a small number of the
most important things. Health and
education indicators, such as the
ones we used in comparison of
Kerala and Maharashtra, are among
them. Over the past decade or so,
health and education indicators
have come to be widely used along
with income as a measure of
development. For instance, Human
Development Report published by
UNDP compares countries based on
the educational levels of the people,
their health status and per capita
income. It would be interesting to look
at certain relevant data regarding
India and its neighbours from Human

One way to find out if adults are undernourished is to
calculate what nutrition scientists call Body Mass
Index (BMI). This is easy to calculate. Take the weight
of the person in kg. Then take the height in metres.
Divide the weight by the square of the height. If this
figure is less than 18.5 then the person would be
considered undernourished. However, if this BMI is
more than 25, then a person is overweight. Do
remember that this criterion is not applicable to growing
children.
Let each student in a
class find out the weight
and height of three adult
persons of different
economic backgrounds
such as construction
workers,

servants, office workers,

We would certainly like this level of

of scientists have been warning that
the present type, and levels, of
development are not sustainable.

“Recent evidence suggests that the groundwater is under

300 districts have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres
during the past 20 years. Nearly one-third of the country is
overusing their groundwater reserves. In another 25 years,
60 per cent of the country would be doing the same if the present
way of using this resource continues. Groundwater overuse is
particularly found in the agriculturally prosperous regions of
Punjab and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and
south India, some coastal areas and the rapidly growing urban
settlements.”

Groundwater is an example of
renewable resources. These resources
are replenished by nature as in the
case of crops and plants. However,
even these resources may be
overused. For example, in the case of
groundwater, if we use more than
what is being replenished by rain then
we would be overusing this resource.

The table gives an estimate of reserves of crude oil (column1). More
important, it also tells us for how many years the stock of crude oil will
last if people continue to extract it at the present rate. The reserves would
last only 53 years more. This is for the world as a whole. However, different
countries face different situations. Countries like India depend on
importing oil  from abroad because they do not have enough stocks of
their own. If prices of oil increase this becomes a burden for everyone.
There are countries like USA which have low reserves and hence want
to secure oil through military or economic power.
The question of sustainability of development raises many
fundamentally new issues about the nature and process of development.
(a) Is crude oil essential for the development process in a country? Discuss.
(b) India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate for the
country looking at the above situation?
Non-renewable resources are those
which will get exhausted after years
of use. We have a fixed stock on earth
which cannot be replenished. We do
discover new resources that we did
not know of earlier. New sources in
this way add to the stock. However,
over time, even this will get exhausted.

In general, the question of
development or progress is perennial.
At all times as a member of society
and as individuals we need to ask
where we want to go, what we wish to
become and what our goals are. So
the debate on development continues.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER 2:   SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY
An economy is best understood when we
study its components or sectors. Sectoral
classification can be done on the basis of
several criteria. In this chapter, three
types of classifications are discussed:
primary/secondary/tertiary; organised/
unorganised; and public/private. You can
create a discussion about these types by
taking examples familiar to the students
and relate them to their daily life. It is
important to emphasise the changing
roles of sectors. This can be highlighted
further by drawing attention of the
students to the rapid growth of service
sector. While elaborating the ideas
provided in the chapter, the students may
need to be familiarised with a few
fundamental concepts such as Gross
Domestic Product, Employment etc. Since
the students may find this difficult to
understand, it is necessary to explain to
them through examples. Several activities
and exercises are suggested in the chapter
to help the students understand how a
person’s activity could be placed —
whether in the primary, secondary or
tertiary, organised or unorganised, and
public or private sector. You may
encourage the students to talk to various
working people around them (such as
shop owners, casual workers, vegetable
vendors, workshop mechanics, domestic
workers etc.) to know more about how they
live and work. Based on such information,
the students can be encouraged to develop
their own classification of economic
activities.
Another important issue to be
highlighted is about the problems caused
by the changes in the roles of sectors.
The chapter has taken the example of
unemployment and what the government
can do to solve it. The declining importance
of agriculture and growing importance of
industry and services should be related
to the experience of the children by taking
more examples that they may observe in
their day-to-day life. Information derived
from the media could be used for this
purpose. You may encourage the students
to bring important cuttings and stories
from newspapers, which could be
prominently displayed in storyboards, and
encourage the class to discuss these
issues. While discussing the unorganised
sector, the key issue of protecting the
workers engaged in the sector should be
highlighted. You may  also encourage the
students to visit persons and enterprises
in the unorganised sector and get a first
hand experience from real life situation.
Sources for Information
The GDP data used in this chapter
pertaining to Gross Domestic Product at
Factor Cost by Industry of Origin at
2004-05 prices is taken from Economic
Survey 2011. It is a valuable source of GDP
and other information relating to the Indian
economy. For evaluation purposes,
particularly to develop the analytical ability
of learners, teachers can refer to Economic
Survey to get data for different years.
The employment figures are based on
data taken from the five-yearly surveys
on employment and unemployment
conducted by the National Sample Survey
Organisation (NSSO). NSSO is an
organisation under the Ministry of
Statistics, Planning and Programme
Implementation, Government of India.
The website you can log onto is:

CHAPTER 2
SECTORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
Let us look at these pictures. You will find that people are
engaged in various economic activities. Some of these are
activities producing goods. Some others are producing
services. These activities are happening around us every
minute even as we speak.  How do we understand these
activities? One way of doing this is to group them (classify
them) using some important criterion. These groups are also
called sectors.

There are many activities that are
undertaken by directly using
natural resources. Take, for
example, the cultivation of cotton. It
takes place within a crop season. For
the growth of the cotton plant, we
depend mainly, but not entirely,
on natural factors like rainfall,
sunshine and climate. The product
of this activity, cotton, is a natural
product. Similarly, in the case of an
activity like dairy, we are dependent
on the biological process of
the animals and availability
of fodder etc. The product
here, milk, also is a natural
product. Similarly, minerals
and ores are also natural
products. When we produce
a good by exploiting natural
resources, it is an activity of
the primary sector. Why
primary? This is because it
forms the base for all
other products that we
subsequently make. Since
natural
products we get are from
agriculture, dairy, fishing,
forestry, this sector is also
called agriculture and related
sector.
The secondary sector covers
activities in which natural products
are changed into other forms through
ways of manufacturing that we
associate with industrial activity. It is
the next step after primary. The
product is not produced by nature
but has to be made and therefore
some process of manufacturing is
essential. This could be in a factory, a
workshop or at home.  For example,
using cotton fibre from the plant, we
spin yarn and weave cloth. Using
sugarcane as a raw material, we make
sugar or gur. We convert earth into
bricks and use bricks to make houses
and buildings. Since this sector
gradually became associated with the
different kinds of industries that came
up, it is also called as industrial sector.
After primary and secondary, there
is a third category of activities that falls
under tertiary sector and is different
from the above two. These are
activities that help in the development
of the primary and secondary sectors.
These activities, by themselves, do not
produce a good but they are an aid
or a support for the production
process. For example, goods that are
produced in the primary or secondary
sector would need to be transported
by trucks or trains and then sold in
wholesale and retail shops. At times,
it may be necessary to store these in
godowns. We also may need to talk to
others over telephone or send letters
(communication) or borrow money
from banks (banking) to help
production and trade. Transport,
storage, communication, banking,
trade are some examples of tertiary
activities. Since these activities
generate services rather than goods,
the tertiary sector is also called the
service sector.
Service sector also includes some
essential services that may not directly
help in the production of goods. For
example, we require teachers, doctors,
and those who provide personal
services such as washermen, barbers,
cobblers, lawyers, and people to do
administrative and accounting works.
In recent times, certain new services
based on information technology such
as internet cafe, ATM booths, call
centres, software companies etc have
become important.

Imagine what would happen if farmers
refuse to sell sugarcane to a particular
sugar mill. The mill will have to shut
down.
Imagine what would happen to cotton
cultivation if companies decide not to
buy from the Indian market and import
all cotton they need from other
countries. Indian cotton cultivation will
become less profitable and the farmers
may even go bankrupt, if they cannot
quickly switch to other crops. Cotton
prices will fall.
Farmers buy many goods such as
tractors,
pumpsets,
electricity,
pesticides and fertilisers. Imagine what
would happen if the price of fertilisers
or pumpsets go up. Cost of cultivation
of the farmers will rise and their profits
will be reduced.
People working in industrial and service
sector need food. Imagine what would
happen if there is a strike by
transporters and lorries refuse to take
vegetables, milk, etc. from rural areas.
Food will become scarce in urban areas
whereas farmers will be unable to sell
their products.

The various production activities in the primary, secondary
and tertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods
and services. Also, the three sectors have a large number of
people working in them to produce these goods and services.
The next step, therefore, is to see how much goods and services
are produced and how many people work in each sector. In
an economy there could be one or more sectors which are
dominant in terms of total production and employment, while
other sectors are relatively small in size.
How do we count the various goods and
services and know the total production in
each sector?
With so many thousands of goods and services produced,
you might think this is an impossible task! Not only would
the task be enormous, you might also wonder how we can
add up cars and computers and nails and furniture. It won’t
make sense!!!
You are right in thinking so. To get around this problem,
economists suggest that the values of goods and services
should be used rather than adding up the actual numbers.
For example, if 10,000 kgs of wheat is sold at Rs 8 per kg,
the value of wheat will be Rs 80,000. The value of 5000
coconuts at Rs 10 per coconut will be Rs 50,000. Similarly,
the value of goods and services in the three sectors are
calculated, and then added up.
Remember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not
every good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be
counted. It makes sense only to include the final goods and
services. Take, for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a
flour mill for Rs 8 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sells
the flour to a biscuit company for Rs 10 per kg. The biscuit
company uses the flour and things such as sugar and oil to
make four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market
to the consumers for Rs 60 (Rs 15 per packet). Biscuits are
the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.
Why are only ‘final goods and services’ counted? In
contrast to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat
flour in this example are intermediate goods.  Intermediate
goods are used up in producing final goods and services.
The value of final goods already includes the value of all
the intermediate goods that are used in making the final
good. Hence, the value of Rs 60 for the biscuits (final good)
already includes the value of flour (Rs 10). Similarly, the

value of all other intermediate goods
would have been included. To count
the value of the flour and wheat
separately is therefore not correct
because then we would be counting
the value of the same things a number
of times. First as wheat, then as flour
and finally as biscuits.
The value of final goods and
services produced in each sector
during a particular year provides
the total production of the sector
for that year. And the sum of
production in the three sectors gives
what is called the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of a country.  It is the
value of all final goods and services
produced within a country during a
particular year. GDP shows how big
the economy is.
In India, the mammoth task of
measuring GDP is undertaken by a
central government ministry. This
Ministry, with the help of various
government departments of all the
Indian states and union territories,
collects information relating to total
volume of goods and services and their
prices and then estimates the GDP.
Historical Change in Sectors
Generally, it has been noted from the
histories of many, now developed,
countries that at initial stages of
development, primary sector was the
most important sector of economic
activity.
As the methods of farming
changed and agriculture sector began
to prosper, it produced much more
food than before. Many people could
now take up other activities. There
were increasing number of craft-
persons and traders. Buying and
selling activities increased many times.
Besides, there were also transporters,
administrators, army etc. However, at
this stage, most of the goods produced
were natural products from the
primary sector and most people were
also employed in this sector.
Over a long time (more than
hundred years), and especially
because
methods
manufacturing were introduced,
factories came up and started
expanding. Those people who had
earlier worked on farms now began
to work in factories in large numbers.
People began to use many more
goods that were produced in factories
at cheap rates. Secondary sector
gradually became the most important
in total production and employment.
Hence, over time, a shift had taken
place. This means that the importance
of the sectors had changed.
In the past 100 years, there has
been a further shift from secondary to
tertiary sector in developed countries.
The service sector has become the most
important in terms of total production.
Most of the working people are also
employed in the service sector. This is
the general pattern observed in
developed countries.
What is the total production and
employment in the three sectors in
India? Over the years have there been
changes similar to the pattern
observed for the developed countries?
We shall see in the next section.
1. What does the history of developed countries indicate
about the shifts that have taken place between sectors?
2. Correct and arrange the important aspects for calculating
GDP from this Jumble.
To count goods and services we add the numbers that
are produced. We count all those that were produced in
the last five years. Since we shouldn’t leave out anything
we add up all these goods and services.

Rising Importance of the
Tertiary Sector in Production
Over the forty years between 1970-71
and 2010-11, while production in all
the three sectors has increased, it has
increased the most in the tertiary sector.
As a result, in the year 2010-11, the
tertiary sector has emerged as the
largest producing sector in India
replacing the primary sector.
Why is the tertiary sector becoming
so important in India? There could be
several reasons.
First, in any country several
services
hospitals,
educational institutions, post and
telegraph services, police stations,
courts, village administrative offices,
municipal corporations, defence,
transport,
banks,
insurance
companies, etc. are required. These
can be considered as basic services.
In a developing country the
government has to take responsibility
for the provision of these services.
Second, the development of
agriculture and industry leads to the
development of services such as

transport, trade, storage and the like,
as we have already seen. Greater the
development of the primary and
secondary sectors, more would be the
demand for such services.
Third, as income levels rise, certain
sections of people start demanding
many more services like eating out,
tourism, shopping, private hospitals,
private schools, professional training
etc. You can see this change quite
sharply in cities, especially in big cities.
Fourth, over the past decade or so,
certain new services such as
those based on information and
communication technology have
become important and essential. The
production of these services has been
rising rapidly.  In Chapter 4, we shall
see examples of these new services
and the reasons for their expansion.
However, you must remember that
not all of the service sector is growing
equally well. Service sector in India
employs many different kinds of
people. At one end there are a limited
number of services that employ highly
skilled and educated workers. At the
other end, there are a very large
number of workers engaged in
services such as small shopkeepers,
repair persons, transport persons,
etc. These people barely manage to
earn a living and yet they perform
these services because no alternative
opportunities for work are available
to them. Hence, only a part of this
sector is growing in importance. You
shall read more about this in the next
section.
Where are most of the people
employed?
Graph 2 presents percentage share of
the three sectors in GDP. Now you can
directly see the changing importance
of the sectors over the forty years.
Graph 2 : Share of Sectors in GDP (%)
A remarkable fact about India is
that while there has been a change
in the share of the three sectors in
GDP, a similar shift has not taken
place in employment. Graph 3
shows the share of employment in
the three sectors in 1970-71 and
2009-10. The primary sector
continues to be the largest
employer even now.
Why didn’t a similar shift out of
primary sector happen in case of
employment? It is because not
enough jobs were created in the
secondary and tertiary sectors.  Even

though industrial output or the
production of goods went up by
more than nine times during the
period, employment in the industry
went up by around three times. The
same applies to tertiary sector as
well. While production in the service
sector rose by more than 14 times,
employment in the service sector
rose around five times.
As a result, more than half of the
workers in the country are working
in the primary sector, mainly in
agriculture, producing only a
quarter of the GDP. In contrast to
this, the secondary and tertiary
sectors produce three-fourth of the
produce whereas they employ less
than half the people. Does this mean
that the workers in agriculture are
not producing as much as they
could?
What it means is that there are
more people in agriculture than is
necessary. So, even if you move a few
people out, production will not be
affected. In other words, workers in
agricultural sector ar e under -
employed.
For instance, take the case of a
small farmer, Laxmi , owning about
two hectares of unirrigated land
dependent only on rain and
growing crops like jowar and arhar.
All five members of her family work
in the plot throughout the year.
Why? They have nowhere else to go
for work. You will see that everyone
is working, none remains idle, but
in actual fact their labour effort
gets divided. Each one is doing
some work but no one is fully
employed. This is the situation of
underemployment, where people
are apparently working but all
of them are made to work less
than their potential. This kind of
underemployment is hidden in
contrast to someone who does not
have a job and is clearly visible as
unemployed. Hence, it is also
called disguised unemployment.
Now, supposing a landlord,
Sukhram, comes and hires one or
two members of the family to work
on his land. Laxmi’s family is now
able to earn some extra income
through wages. Since you do not
need five people to look after that
small plot, two people moving out
does not affect production on their
farm. In the above example, two
people may move to work in a
factory. Once again the earnings of
the family would increase and they
would also continue to produce as
much from their land.
There are lakhs of farmers like
Laxmi  in India. This means that even
if we remove a lot of people from
agricultural sector and provide them
with proper work elsewhere,
agricultural production will not
suffer. The incomes of the people who
take up other work would increase
the total family income.
This underemployment can also
happen in other sectors. For
example there are thousands of
casual workers in the service
sector in urban areas who search
for daily employment. They are
employed as painters, plumbers,
repair persons and others doing
odd jobs. Many of them don’t find
work everyday. Similarly, we see
other people of the service sector
on the street pushing a cart or
selling something where they may
spend the whole day but earn
very little. They are doing this
work because they do not have
better opportunities.

How to Create More
Employment?
From the above discussion, we can see
that there continues to be considerable
underemployment in agriculture.
There are also people who are not
employed at all. In what ways can one
increase employment for people? Let
us look at some of them.
Take the case of Laxmi with her
two-hectare plot of un-irrigated land.
The government can spend some
money or banks can provide a loan,
to construct a well for her family to
irrigate the land. Laxmi will then be
able to irrigate her land and take a
second crop, wheat, during the rabi
season. Let us suppose that one
hectare of wheat can provide
employment to two people for 50 days
(including sowing, watering, fertiliser

application and harvesting).  So, two
more members of the family can be
employed in her own field. Now
suppose a new dam is constructed
and canals are dug to irrigate many
such farms. This could lead to a lot of
employment generation within the
agricultural sector itself reducing the
problem of underemployment.
Now, suppose Laxmi and other
farmers produce much more than
before. They would also need to sell some
of this. For this they may be required to
transport their products to a nearby
town. If the government invests some
money in transportation and storage of
crops, or makes better rural roads so
that mini-trucks reach everywhere
several farmers like Laxmi, who now
have access to water, can continue to
grow and sell these crops. This activity
can provide productive employment to
not just farmers but also others such as
those in services like transport or trade.
Laxmi’s need is not confined to
water alone. To cultivate the land, she
also needs seeds, fertilisers,
agricultural
equipments
pumpsets to draw water. Being a poor
farmer, she cannot afford many of
these. So she will have to borrow money
from moneylenders and pay a high
rate of interest. If the local bank gives
her credit at a reasonable rate of
interest, she will be able to buy all these
in time and cultivate her land. This
means that along with water, we also
need to provide cheap agricultural
credit to the farmers for farming to
improve. We will look at some of these
needs in Chapter 3, Money and Credit.
Another way by which we can
tackle this problem is to identify,
promote and locate industries and
services in semi-rural areas where a
large number of people may be
employed. For instance, suppose
many farmers decide to grow arhar
and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting
up a dal mill to procure and process
these and sell in the cities is one such
example. Opening a cold storage could
give an opportunity for farmers to
store their products like potatoes and
onions and sell them when the price
is good. In villages near forest areas,
we can start honey collection centres
where farmers can come and sell wild
honey. It is also possible to set up
industries that process vegetables and
agricultural produce like potato,
sweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato,
fruits, which can be sold in outside
markets.
provide
employment in industries located in
semi-rural areas and not necessarily
in large urban centres.

Under NREGA 2005, all those who
are able to, and are in need of, work
are guaranteed 100 days of
employment in a year by the
government. If the government fails in
its duty to provide employment, it will
give unemployment allowances to the
people. The types of work that would
in future help to increase the
production from land  will be given
preference under the Act.
labourers.  If these children are to
attend schools, we will require more
buildings, more teachers and other
staff. A study conducted by the
Planning Commission estimates that
nearly 20 lakh jobs can be created in
the education sector alone. Similarly,
if we are to improve the health
situation, we need many more doctors,
nurses, health workers etc. to work
in rural areas. These are some ways
by which jobs would be created and
we would also be able to address the
important aspects of development
talked about in Chapter 1.
Every state or region has potential
for increasing the income and
employment for people in that area.
It could be tourism, or regional craft
industry, or new services like IT. Some
of these would require proper
planning and support from the
government. For example, the same
study by the Planning Commission
says that if tourism as a sector is
improved, every year we can give
additional employment to more than
35 lakh people.
We must realise that some of the
suggestions discussed above would
take a long time to implement. For
the short-term, we need some quick
measures. Recognising this, the
central government in India made a
law implementing the Right to Work
in 200 districts of India and then
extended to an additional 130

these people may not be employed by
anyone but may work on their own
but they too have to register

enjoy security of employment. They
are expected to work only a fixed
number of hours. If they work more,
they have to be paid overtime by the
employer. They also get several other

given in various laws such as the

these benefits? They get paid leave,
payment during holidays, provident
fund, gratuity etc. They are supposed
to get medical benefits and, under the
laws, the factory manager has to
ensure facilities like drinking water
and a safe working environment.
When they retire, these workers get
pensions as well.
In contrast, Kamal works in the
unorganised sector. The unorganised
sector is characterised by small and
scattered units which are largely
outside the control of the government.
There are rules and regulations but
these are not followed. Jobs here are
low-paid and often not regular. There
is no provision for overtime, paid
leave, holidays, leave due to sickness
etc. Employment is not secure. People
can be asked to leave without any
reason. When there is less work, such
as during some seasons, some people
may be asked to leave. A lot also
depends on the whims of the
employer. This sector includes a large
number of people who are employed
on their own doing small jobs such
as selling on the street or doing repair
work. Similarly, farmers work on their
own and hire labourers as and when
they require.

How to Protect Workers in
the Unorganised Sector?
The organised sector offers jobs that
are the most sought-after. But the
employment opportunities in the
organised sector have been expanding
very slowly. It is also common to find
many organised sector enterprises in
the unorganised sector. They adopt
such strategies to evade taxes and
refuse to follow laws that protect
labourers. As a result, a large number
of workers are forced to enter the
unorganised sector jobs, which pay a
very low salary. They are often
exploited and not paid a fair wage.
Their earnings are low and not
regular. These jobs are not secure and
have no other benefits.
Since the 1990s, it is also common
to see a large number of workers
losing their jobs in the organised
sector. These workers are forced to
take up jobs in the unorganised
sector with low earnings. Hence,
besides the need for more work, there
is also a need for protection and
support of the workers in the
unorganised sector.
Who are these vulnerable people
who need protection? In the rural
areas, the unorganised sector mostly
comprises of landless agricultural
labourers, small and marginal
farmers, sharecroppers and artisans
(such as weavers, blacksmiths,
carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly
80 per cent of rural households in
India are in small and marginal
farmer category. These farmers need
to be supported through adequate
facility for timely delivery of seeds,
agricultural inputs, credit, storage
facilities and marketing outlets.
In the urban areas, unorganised
sector comprises mainly of workers in
small-scale industry, casual workers
in construction, trade and transport
etc., and those who work as street
vendors, head load workers, garment
makers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale
industry also needs government’s
support for procuring raw material
and marketing of output. The casual
workers in both rural and urban
areas need to be protected.
We also find that majority of
workers from scheduled castes, tribes
and backward communities
find themselves in the
unorganised sector. Besides
getting the irregular and low
paid work, these workers also
face social discrimination.
Protection and support to
the unorganised sector
workers is thus necessary
for both economic and
social development.
When factories close down, many
once regular workers are found
selling goods or pushing a cart or
doing some other odd job

LET’S RECALL
With so many activities taking place around us, one needs to use the
process of classification to think in a useful manner. The criterion for
classification could be many depending on what we desire to find out.
The process of classification helps to analyse a situation.
In dividing the economic activities into three sectors — primary,
secondary, tertiary — the criterion used was the ‘nature of activity’. On
the basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern of total
production and employment in India. Similarly, we divided the economic
activities into organised and unorganised and used the classification to
look at employment in the two sectors.
What was the most important conclusion that was derived from the
classification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that were
indicated? Can you summarise the information in the following table?
TABLE 2.4 CLASSIFYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES
Another way of classifying economic
activities into sectors could be on the
basis of who owns assets and is
responsible for the delivery of services.
In the public sector, the government
owns most of the assets and provides
all the services. In the private sector,
ownership of assets and delivery of
services is in the hands of private
individuals or companies. Railways or
post office is an example of the public
sector whereas companies like Tata
Iron and Steel Company Limited
(TISCO) or Reliance Industries
Limited (RIL) are privately owned.
Activities in the private sector are
guided by the motive to earn profits.
To get such services we have to pay
money to these individuals and
companies. The purpose of the public
sector is not just to earn profits.
Governments raise money through
taxes and other ways to meet expenses
on the services rendered by it. Modern
day governments spend on a whole
range of activities. What are these
activities? Why do governments spend
on such activities? Let’s find out.
There are several things needed by
the society as a whole but which the
private sector  will not provide at
a reasonable cost. Why? Some of
these need spending large sums of
money, which is beyond the capacity

of the private sector. Also, collecting
money from thousands of people who
use these facilities is not easy. Even if
they do provide these things they
would charge a high rate for their
use. Examples are construction of
roads, bridges, railways, harbours,
generating electricity, providing
irrigation through dams etc.  Thus,
governments have to undertake such
heavy  spending and ensure that
these facilities are available for
everyone.
There are some activities, which
the government has to support. The
private sector may not continue their
production or business unless
government encourages it. For
example, selling electricity at the cost
of generation may push up the costs
of production of goods in many
industries. Many units, especially
small-scale units, might have to shut
down. Government here steps in by
producing and supplying electricity
at rates which these industries can
afford. Government has to bear part
of the cost.
Similarly, the Government in India
buys wheat and rice from farmers at
a ‘fair price’. This it stores in its
godowns and sells at a lower price to
consumers through ration shops. You
have read about this in the chapter
on Food Security in Class IX. The
government has to bear some of the
cost. In this way, the government
supports
farmers
consumers.
There are a large number of
activities which are the primary
responsibility of the government. The
government must spend on these.
Providing health and education
facilities for all is one example. We have
discussed some of these issues in the
first chapter. Running proper schools
and providing quality education,
particularly elementary education, is
the duty of the government. India’s size
of illiterate population is one of the
largest in the world.
Similarly, we know that nearly half
of India’s children are malnourished
and a quarter of them are critically ill.
We have read about Infant Mortality
Rates. The infant mortality rate of
Odisha (53) or Madhya Pradesh (56)
is higher than some of the poorest
regions of the world. Government
also needs to pay attention to aspects
of human development such as
availability of safe drinking water,
housing facilities for the poor and food
and nutrition.  It is also the duty of
the government to take care of the
poorest and most ignored regions of
the country through increased
spending in such areas.
SUMMING UP
In this chapter we have looked at ways of
classifying economic activities into some
meaningful groups. One way of doing this
is to examine whether the activity relates to
the primary, secondary or tertiary sectors.
The data for India, for the last thirty years,
shows that while  goods and services
produced in the tertiary sector contribute
the most to GDP, the employment remains
in the primary sector. We have also seen
what all can be done for increasing
employment opportunities in the country.
Another classification is to consider whether
people are working in organised or
unorganised sectors. Most people are
working in the unorganised sectors and
protection is necessary for them. We also
looked at the difference between private and
public activities, and why it is important for
public activities to focus on certain areas.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
CHAPTER 3 : MONEY AND CREDIT
Money is a fascinating subject and full of
curiosities. It is important to capture this
element for the students. The history of
money and how various forms were used at
different times is an interesting story. At this
stage the purpose is to allow students to
realise the social situation in which these
forms were used.  Modern forms of money
are linked to the banking system. This is the
central idea of the first part of the chapter.
The present situation in India, where
newer forms of money are slowly spreading
with computerisation of the banking system,
offers many opportunities to students to
explore on their own. We need not get into a
formal discussion of the ‘functions of money’
but let it come up as questions. There are
certain areas that are not covered such as
‘creation of money’ (money multiplier) or the
backing of the modern system that may be
discussed if you desire.
Credit is a crucial element in economic
life and it is therefore important to first
understand this in a conceptual manner.
What are the aspects that one looks at in
any credit arrangement and how this affects
people is the main focus of the second part
of the chapter. The world around us offers
a tremendous variety of such arrangements
and it would be ideal to explain these
aspects of credit from situations that are
familiar to your students. The other crucial
issue of credit is its availability to all,
especially the poor, and on reasonable
terms. We need to emphasise that this is a
right of the people and without which a large
section of them would be kept out of the
development process. There are many
innovative interventions, such as that of
Grameen Bank, that students may be made
familiar with but it is important to realise
that we don’t have answers to all questions.
We need to find new ways and this is one of
the social challenges that developing
countries face.
Sources for Information
The data on formal and informal sector credit
used in this chapter is drawn from the
survey on rural debt by the National Sample
Survey Organisation (All India Debt and
Investment Survey, 70 th Round 2013,

The use of money spans a very large
part of our everyday life. Look around
you and you would easily be able to
identify several transactions involving
money in any single day. Can you
make a list of these? In many of these
transactions, goods are being bought
and sold with the use of money. In
some of these transactions, services
are being exchanged with money.  For
some, there might not be any actual
transfer of money taking place now
but a promise to pay money later.
Have you ever wondered why
transactions are made in
money? The reason is simple.
A person holding money can easily
exchange it for any commodity or
service that he or she might want.
Thus everyone  prefers to receive
payments in money and then
exchange the money for things that
they want.  Take the case of a shoe
manufacturer. He wants to sell shoes
in the market and buy wheat.  The
shoe manufacturer will first exchange
shoes that he has produced for
money, and then exchange the money
for wheat. Imagine how much more
difficult it would be if the shoe
manufacturer had to directly
exchange shoes for wheat without the
use of money. He would have to look
for a wheat growing farmer who not
only wants to sell wheat
but also wants to buy the
shoes
exchange.
That is, both parties
have to agree to
sell and buy each
others commodities.
This is known as
double coincidence
of wants. What a person
desires to sell is exactly what the
other wishes to buy. In a barter
system where goods are directly
exchanged without the use of money,
double coincidence of wants is an
essential feature.
In contrast, in an economy where
money is in use, money by providing
the crucial intermediate step
eliminates the need for double
coincidence of wants. It is no longer
necessary for the shoe manufacturer
to look for a farmer who will buy his
shoes and at the same time sell him

We have seen that money is
something that can act as a medium
of exchange in transactions.  Before
the introduction of coins, a variety of
objects was used as money. For
example, since the very early ages,
Indians used  grains and cattle as
money. Thereafter came the use of
metallic coins — gold, silver, copper
coins — a phase which continued well
into the last century.
Currency
Modern forms of money include
currency — paper notes and coins.
Unlike the things that were used as
money earlier, modern currency is not
made of precious metal such as gold,
silver and copper.  And unlike grain
and cattle, they are neither of
everyday use. The modern currency
is without any use of its own.
Then, why is it accepted as a
medium of exchange?  It is accepted
as a medium of exchange because the
currency is authorised by the
government of the country.
In India, the Reserve Bank of India
issues currency notes on behalf of the
central government. As per Indian
law, no other individual or
organisation is allowed to issue
currency. Moreover, the law legalises
the use of rupee as a medium of
payment that cannot be refused in
settling transactions in India. No
individual in India can legally refuse
a payment made in rupees. Hence,
the rupee is widely accepted as a
medium of exchange.
Deposits with Banks
The other form in which people hold
money is as deposits with banks. At
a point of time, people need only some
currency  for their day-to-day needs.
For instance, workers who receive
their salaries at the end of each month
have extra cash at the beginning of
the month. What do people do with
this extra cash? They deposit it with
the banks by opening a bank
account in their name. Banks accept
the deposits and also pay an amount
as interest on the deposits. In this way
people’s money is safe with the
banks and it earns an amount as
interest.  People also have the
provision to withdraw the money as
and when they require. Since the
deposits in the bank accounts can be
withdrawn on demand, these
deposits are called demand deposits.
1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?
2. Can you think of some examples of goods / services being exchanged or wages being
paid through barter?

Cheque Payments
A shoe manufacturer, M. Salim has to make a payment to the leather supplier and writes
a cheque for a specific amount. This means that the shoe manufacturer instructs his
bank to pay this amount to the leather supplier. The leather supplier takes this cheque,
and  deposits it in his own account in the bank. The money is transferred from one bank
account to another bank account in a couple of days. The transaction is complete without
any payment of cash.
Thus we see that demand deposits
share the essential features of money.
The facility of cheques against demand
deposits makes it possible to directly
settle payments without the use of cash.
Since demand deposits are accepted
widely as a means of payment, along
with currency, they constitute money
in the modern economy.
You must remember the role that
the banks play here. But for the
banks, there would be no demand
deposits and no payments by
cheques against these deposits.  The
modern forms of money — currency
and deposits — are closely linked to
the working of the modern banking
system.

Demand deposits offer another
interesting facility. It is this facility
which lends it the essential
characteristics of money (that of a
medium of exchange). You would
have heard of payments being
made by cheques instead of cash.
For payment through cheque, the
payer who has an account with the
bank, makes out a cheque for a
specific amount. A cheque is a
paper instructing the bank to pay
a specific amount from the
person’s account to the person in
whose name the cheque has been
issued.

Let us take the story of banks further.
What do the banks do with the
deposits which they accept from the
public? There is an interesting
mechanism at work here. Banks keep
only a small proportion of their
deposits as cash with themselves.  For
example, banks in India these days
hold about 15 per cent of their
deposits as cash. This is kept as
provision to pay the depositors who
might come to withdraw money from
the bank on any given day. Since, on
any particular day, only some of its
many depositors come to withdraw
cash, the bank is able to manage with
this cash.
Banks use the major portion of the
deposits to extend loans.  There is a
huge demand for loans for various
economic activities. We shall read more
about this in the following sections.
Banks make use of the deposits to
meet the loan requirements of the
people.  In this way, banks mediate
between those who have surplus
funds (the depositors) and those who
are in need of these funds (the
borrowers). Banks charge a higher
interest rate on loans than what they
offer on deposits. The difference
between what is charged from
borrowers and what is paid to
depositors is their main source of
income.

A large number of transactions in our day-to-day activities
involve credit in some form or the other. Credit (loan) refers to
an agreement in which the lender supplies the borrower with
money, goods or services in return for the promise of future
payment. Let us see how credit works through the following
two examples.
(1) Festival Season
(1) Festival Season

(1) Festival Season
It is festival season two months from now
and the shoe manufacturer, Salim, has
received an order from a large trader in
town for 3,000 pairs of shoes to be
delivered in a month time. To complete
production on time, Salim has to hire a few
more workers for stitching and pasting
work. He has to purchase the raw
materials. To meet these expenses, Salim
obtains loans from two sources. First, he
asks the leather supplier to supply leather
now and promises to pay him later.
Second, he obtains loan in cash from the
large trader as advance payment for
1000 pairs of shoes with a promise to
deliver the whole order by the end of the
month.
At the end of the month, Salim is able to
deliver the order, make a good profit, and
repay the money that he had borrowed.

TWO DIFFERENT CREDIT SITUATIONS
In this case, Salim obtains credit to meet the working
capital needs of production. The credit helps him to meet the
ongoing expenses of production, complete production on time,
and thereby increase his earnings. Credit therefore plays a
vital and positive role in this situation.
Swapna, a small farmer, grows groundnut on her three
acres of land. She takes a loan from the moneylender
to meet the expenses of cultivation, hoping that her
harvest would help repay the loan. Midway through
the season the crop is hit by pests and the crop
fails. Though Swapna sprays  her crops with
expensive pesticides, it makes little difference. She
is unable to repay the moneylender and the debt
grows over the year into a large amount. Next
year, Swapna takes a fresh loan for cultivation.
It is a normal crop this year. But the earnings
are not enough to cover the old loan.
She is caught in debt. She has to sell
a part of the land to pay off the debt.
2015-2016
TERMS OF CREDIT
Every loan agreement specifies an
interest rate which the borrower must
pay to the lender along with the
In rural areas, the main demand
for credit is for crop production. Crop
production involves considerable
costs on seeds, fertilisers, pesticides,
water, electricity, repair of equipment,
etc. There is a minimum stretch of
three to four months between the time
when the farmers buy these inputs
and when they sell the crop. Farmers
usually take crop loans at the
beginning of the season and repay the
loan after harvest. Repayment of the
loan is crucially dependent on the
income from farming.
1. Fill the following table.
2. Supposing Salim continues to get orders from traders. What would be

land to repay the loan. Credit, instead
of helping Swapna improve her
earnings, left her worse off. This is an
example of what is commonly called
debt-trap. Credit in this case pushes
the borrower into a situation from
which recovery is very painful.
In one situation credit helps to
increase earnings and therefore the
person is better off than before. In
another situation, because of the
crop failure, credit
pushes the person into
a debt trap. To repay
her loan she has to sell
a portion of her land.

addition, lenders may demand
collateral (security) against loans.
Collateral is an asset that the
borrower owns (such as land,
building, vehicle, livestocks,
deposits with banks) and  uses this
as a guarantee to a lender until
the loan is repaid. If the borrower
fails to repay the loan, the lender has
the right to sell the asset or collateral
to obtain payment. Property such as
land titles, deposits with banks,
livestock are some common examples
of collateral used for borrowing.

Shyamal tells us that every season he needs
loans for cultivation on his 1.5 acres of land. Till
a few years back, he would borrow money from
the village moneylender at an interest rate of
five per cent per month (60% per annum).
For the last few years, Shyamal has been
borrowing from an agricultural trader in the
village at an interest rate of three per cent
per month. At the beginning of the cropping
season, the trader supplies the farm inputs on
credit, which is  to be repaid when the crops
are ready for harvest.
Besides the interest charge on the loan, the
trader also makes the farmers promise to
sell the crop to him. This way the trader
can ensure that the money is repaid
promptly. Also, since the crop prices are low
after the harvest, the trader is able to
make a profit from buying the crop at a low
price from the farmers and then selling it
later when the price has risen.

Rohit and Ranjan had finished reading about the terms of credit in class.
They were eager to know the various credit arrangements that existed in
their area: who were the people who provided credit? Who were the
borrowers? What were the terms of credit? They decided to talk to some
people in their village.  Read what they record...
15th Nov, 2006.
We head directly for the fields where most farmers and
labourers would be working at this time of the day. The fields
are planted with potato crops. We first meet Shyamal, a small
farmer in Sonpur, a small irrigated village.
We next meet Arun who is supervising the
work of one farm labourer. Arun has seven
acres of land. He is one of the few persons
in Sonpur to receive bank loan for
cultivation. The interest rate on the  loan
is 8.5 per cent per annum, and can be repaid
anytime in the next three years.  Arun plans
to repay the loan after harvest by selling a
part of the crop. He then intends to store
the rest of the potatoes in a cold storage
and  apply for a fresh loan from the bank
against the cold storage receipt. The bank
offers this facility to farmers who have
taken crop loan from them.
Rama is working in a neighbouring field. She
works as an agricultural labourer. There are
several months in the year when Rama has
no work, and needs credit to meet the daily
expenses. Expenses on sudden illnesses or
functions in the family are also met through
loans. Rama has to depend on her employer,
a medium landowner in Sonpur, for credit.
The landowner charges an interest rate of
5 per cent per month. Rama repays the
money by working for the landowner. Most
of the time, Rama has to take a fresh loan,
before the previous loan has been repaid.
At present, she owes the landowner
Rs 5,000. Though the landowner doesn’t
treat her well, she continues to work for him
since she can get loans from him when in
need. Rama tells us that the only source of
credit for the landless people in Sonpur are
the landowner-employers.

industrial workers cooperatives, etc. Krishak
Cooperative functions in a village not very far away
from Sonpur. It has 2300 farmers as members. It
accepts deposits from its members. With these
deposits as collateral, the Cooperative has obtained
a large loan from the bank. These funds are used to
provide loans to members. Once these loans are
repaid, another round of lending can take place.
Krishak Cooperative provides loans for the purchase
of agricultural implements, loans for cultivation
and agricultural trade, fishery loans, loans for
construction of houses and for a variety of other
expenses.

Compared to the formal lenders,
most of the informal lenders charge a
much higher interest on loans. Thus,
the cost to the borrower of informal
loans is much higher.
Higher cost of borrowing means a
larger part of the earnings of the
borrowers is used to repay the loan.
Hence, borrowers have less income
left for themselves (as we saw for
Shyamal in Sonpur). In certain
cases, the high interest rate for
borrowing can mean that the amount
to be repaid is greater than the
income of the borrower. This could
lead to increasing debt (as we saw for
Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also,
people who might wish to start an
enterprise by borrowing may not do
so because of the high cost of
borrowing.
For these reasons, banks and
cooperative societies need to lend
more. This would lead
to higher incomes

Formal and Informal Credit:
Who gets what?
Graph 2 shows the importance of
formal and informal sources of credit
for people in urban areas.  The people
are divided into four groups, from
poor to rich, as shown in the figure.
You can see that 85 per cent of the
loans taken by poor households in the
urban areas are from informal
sources. Compare this with the rich
urban households. What do you
find? Only 10 per cent of their loans
are from informal sources, while 90
per cent are from formal sources. A
similar pattern is also found in rural
areas. The rich households are
availing cheap credit from formal
lenders whereas the poor households
have to pay a large amount for
borrowing.
What does all this suggest? First,
the formal sector still meets only about
half of the total credit needs of the
rural people. The remaining credit
needs are met from informal sources.

Most loans from informal lenders
carry a very high interest rate and do
little to increase the income of the
borrowers. Thus, it is necessary
that banks and cooperatives
increase their lending particularly
in the rural areas, so that the
dependence on informal sources
of credit reduces.
1. What are the differences between formal and informal sources of credit?
2. Why should credit at reasonable rates be available for all?
3. Should there be a supervisor, such as the Reserve Bank of India, that looks into the
loan activities of informal lenders? Why would its task be quite difficult?
4. Why do you think that the share of formal sector credit is higher for the richer households
compared to the poorer households?
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
SELF-HELP GROUPS FOR THE POOR
Secondly, while formal sector
loans need to expand, it is also
necessary that everyone receives
these loans. At present, it is the richer
households who receive formal credit
whereas the poor have to depend on
the informal sources. It is important
that the formal credit is distributed
more equally so that the poor can
benefit from the cheaper loans.
In the previous section we have seen
that poor households are still
dependent on informal sources of
credit. Why is it so? Banks are not
present everywhere in rural India.
Even when they are present, getting a
loan from a bank is much more
difficult than taking a loan from
informal sources. As we saw for
Megha, bank loans require proper
documents and collateral. Absence of
collateral is one of the major reasons
which prevents the poor from getting
bank loans. Informal lenders such as
moneylenders, on the other hand,
know the borrowers personally and
hence are often willing to give a
loan without collateral. The borrowers
can, if necessary, approach the
moneylenders even without repaying

their earlier loans. However, the
moneylenders charge very high rates
of interest, keep no records of the
transactions and harass the poor
borrowers.
In recent years, people have tried
out some newer ways of providing
loans to the poor. The idea is to
organise rural poor, in particular
women, into small Self Help Groups
(SHGs) and pool (collect) their
savings. A typical SHG has 15-20
members, usually belonging to one
neighbourhood, who meet and save
regularly. Saving per member varies
from Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more,
depending on the ability of the people
to save. Members can take small loans
from the group itself to meet their
needs. The group charges interest on
these loans but this is still less than
what the moneylender charges. After
a year or two, if the group is regular
in savings, it becomes eligible for
availing loan from the bank.
Loan is sanctioned in the
name of the group and is
meant to create self-
employment opportunities
for the members. For
instance, small loans are
provided to the members for
releasing mortgaged land,
for meeting working capital
needs (e.g. buying seeds,
fertilisers, raw materials
like bamboo and cloth), for
housing materials, for
acquiring assets like sewing
machine, handlooms, cattle,
Most of the important
decisions regarding the
savings and loan activities
are taken by the group
members.
group
decides as regards the loans
to be granted — the purpose, amount,
interest to be charged, repayment
schedule etc.  Also, it is the group
which is responsible for the repayment
of the loan. Any case of non-
repayment of loan by any one
member is followed up seriously by
other members in the group. Because
of this feature, banks are willing to
lend to the poor women when
organised in SHGs, even though they
have no collateral as such.
Thus, the SHGs help borrowers
overcome the problem of lack of
collateral. They can get timely loans
for a variety of purposes and at a
reasonable interest rate. Moreover,
SHGs are the building blocks of
organisation of the rural poor. Not
only does it help women to become
financially self-reliant, the regular
meetings of the group provide a
platform to discuss and act on a
variety of social issues such as health,
nutrition, domestic violence, etc.

credit vary substantially between
formal and informal lenders. At
present, it is the richer households
who receive credit from formal sources
whereas the poor have to depend on
the informal sources. It is essential
that the total formal sector credit
increases so that the dependence on
the more expensive informal credit
becomes less. Also, the poor should
get a much greater share of formal
loans from banks, cooperative
societies etc. Both these steps are
important for development.
Grameen Bank of Bangladesh is one of the
biggest success stories in reaching the poor to
meet their credit needs at reasonable rates.
Started in the 1970s as a small project,
Grameen Bank in October 2014 has over 8.63
million members in about 81,390 villages spread
across Bangladesh. Almost all of the borrowers
are women and belong to poorest sections of
the society. These borrowers have proved that
not only are poor women reliable borrowers, but
that they can start and run a variety of small
income-generating activities successfully.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
Most regions of the world are getting increasingly
interconnected. While this interconnectedness
across countries has many dimensions —
cultural, political, social and economic — this
chapter looks at globalisation in a more limited
sense. It defines globalisation as the integration
between countries through foreign trade and
foreign investments by multinational
corporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more
complex issues of portfolio investment have been
left out.
If we look at the past thirty years or so, we
find that MNCs have been a major force in the
globalisation process connecting distant regions
of the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their
production to other countries and what are the
ways in which they are doing so? The first part
of the chapter discusses this. Rather than
relying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise
and influence of the MNCs has been shown
through a variety of examples, mainly drawn
from the Indian context. Note that the examples
are an aid to explain a more general point. While
teaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas
and examples are to be used as illustrations.
You can also creatively use comprehension
passages like the one given after Section II to
test and reinforce new concepts.
Integration of production and integration of
markets is a key idea behind understanding the
process of globalisation and its impact. This has
been dealt with at length in this chapter,
highlighting the role of MNCs in the process.  You
have to ensure that the students grasp this idea
with sufficient clarity, before moving on to the
next topic.
Globalisation has been facilitated by several
factors. Three of these have been highlighted:
rapid improvements in technology, liberalisation
of trade and investment policies and, pressures
from international organisations such as the
WTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating
area for students and you may, with a few
directions, encourage them to do their own
explorations. While discussing liberalisation, you
have to keep in mind that the students are
unaware of what India was like in the
pre-liberalisation era. A role-play could be
conceived to compare and contrast the pre and
post-liberalisation era. Similarly, international
negotiations under WTO and the uneven
balances in power are interesting subjects that
can be covered in a discussion mode rather than
as lectures.
The final section covers the impact of
globalisation. To what extent has globalisation
contributed to the development process? This
section draws on the topics covered in Chapters
1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development
goal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and
activities drawn from the local environment are
a must while discussing this section. This might
include contexts that have not been covered in
the chapter, such as the impact of imports on
local farmers, etc. Collective brainstorming
sessions can be conducted to analyse such
situations.
Sources for Information
The call for a fairer globalisation has been given,
among others, by the International Labour
Organisation — www.ilo.org. Another interesting
resource is the WTO website http://www.wto.org.
It gives access to the variety of agreements that
are being negotiated at the WTO.  For company
related information, most MNCs have their own
websites.  If you want to critically look at
the MNCs, one recommended website is
www.corporatewatch.org.uk.

CHAPTER 4
As consumers in today’s world, some
of us have a wide choice of goods and
services before us. The latest models
of digital cameras, mobile phones and
televisions made by the leading
manufacturers of the world are within
our reach. Every season, new models
of automobiles can be seen on Indian
roads. Gone are the days when
Ambassador and Fiat were the only
cars on  Indian roads. Today, Indians
are buying cars produced by nearly
all the top companies in the world. A
similar explosion of brands can be
seen for many other goods: from shirts
to televisions to processed fruit juices.
Such wide-ranging choice of goods
in our markets is a relatively recent
phenomenon. You wouldn’t have
found such a wide variety of goods in
Indian markets even two decades
back. In a matter of years, our
markets have been transformed!
How do we understand these
rapid transformations? What are the
factors that are bringing about these
changes? And, how are these changes
affecting the lives of the people?
We shall dwell on these questions in
this chapter.

Until the middle of the twentieth
century, production was largely
organised within countries.  What
crossed the boundaries of these
countries were raw materials, food
stuff and finished products. Colonies
such as India exported raw materials
and food stuff and imported finished
goods. Trade was the main channel
connecting distant countries. This was
before large companies called

A large MNC, producing industrial equipment, designs its
products in research centres in the United States, and then
has the components manufactured in China. These are then
shipped to Mexico and Eastern Europe where the products
are assembled and the finished products are sold all over the
world. Meanwhile, the company’s customer care is carried out
through call centres located in India.
PRODUCTION ACROSS COUNTRIES
multinational corporations (MNCs)
emerged on the scene. A MNC is a
company that owns or controls
production in more than one nation.
MNCs set up offices and factories for
production in regions where they can
get cheap labour and other resources.
This is done so that the cost of
production is low and the MNCs can
earn greater profits. Consider the
following example.
This is a call centre in Bangalore, equipped with telecom facilities and access to
Internet to provide information and support to customers abroad.

Complete the following statement to show how the production process in the garment
industry is spread across countries.
The brand tag says ‘Made in Thailand’ but they are not Thai products. We dissect
the manufacturing process and look for the best solution at each step. We are
doing it globally. In making garments, the company may, for example, get cotton
fibre from Korea, ........
LET’S WORK THIS OUT
In this example the MNC is not only
selling its finished products globally,
but more important, the goods and
services are produced globally. As
a result, production is organised in
increasingly complex ways.  The
production process is divided into
small parts and spread out across the
globe. In the above example, China
provides the advantage of being a
cheap manufacturing location.
Mexico and Eastern Europe are useful
for their closeness to the markets
in the US and Europe. India has
highly skilled engineers who can
understand the technical aspects of
production. It also has educated
English speaking youth who can
provide customer care services. And
all this probably can mean 50-60 per
cent cost-savings for the MNC!
The advantage of spreading out
production across the borders to the
multinationals can be truly immense.
INTERLINKING PRODUCTION ACROSS
COUNTRIES
At times, MNCs set up production
jointly with some of the local
companies of these countries. The
benefit to the local company of such
joint production is two-fold. First,
MNCs can provide money for
additional investments, like buying
new machines for faster production.
Second, MNCs might bring with them
the latest technology for production.
In general, MNCs set up production
where it is close to the markets; where
there is skilled and unskilled labour
available at low costs; and where the
availability of other factors of
production is assured. In addition,
MNCs might look for government
policies that look after their interests.
You will read more about the policies
later in the chapter.
Having assured themselves of these
conditions, MNCs set up factories and
offices for production. The money that
is spent to buy assets such as land,
building, machines and other
equipment is called investment.
Investment made by MNCs is called
foreign investment. Any investment
is made with the hope that these
assets will earn profits.

But the most common route for
MNC investments is to buy up local
companies and then to expand
production. MNCs with huge wealth
can quite easily do so. To take an
example, Cargill Foods, a very large
American MNC, has bought over
smaller Indian companies such as
Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had
built a large marketing network in
various parts of India, where its brand
was well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods
had four oil refineries, whose control
has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is
now the largest producer of edible oil
in India, with a capacity to make 5
million pouches daily!
In fact, many of the top MNCs
have wealth exceeding the entire
budgets of the developing country
governments. With such enormous
wealth, imagine the power and
influence of these MNCs!
There’s another way in which
MNCs control production. Large
MNCs in developed countries place
orders for production with small
producers. Garments, footwear,
sports items are examples of
industries where production is
carried out by a large number of
small producers around the world.
The products are supplied to the
MNCs, which then sell these under
their own brand names to the
customers. These large MNCs have
tremendous power to determine price,
quality, delivery, and labour
conditions for these distant
producers.
Thus, we see that there are a
variety of ways in which the MNCs are
spreading their production and
interacting with local producers in
various countries across the globe. By
setting up partnerships with local
companies, by using the local
companies for supplies, by closely
competing with the local companies
or buying them up, MNCs are exerting
a strong influence on production
at these distant locations. As a
result, production in these widely
dispersed locations is getting
interlinked.

Read the passage on the left and answer the questions.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
1. Would you say Ford Motors is a MNC? Why?
2. What is foreign investment? How much did Ford Motors invest in India?
3. By setting up their production plants in India, MNCs such as Ford
Motors tap the advantage not only of the large markets that countries
such as India provide, but also the lower costs of production. Explain
the statement.
4. Why do you think the company wants to develop India as a base for
manufacturing car components for its global operations? Discuss the
following factors:
(a) cost of labour and other resources in India
(b) the presence of several local manufacturers who supply auto-
parts to Ford Motors
(c) closeness to a large number of buyers in India and China
5. In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to
interlinking of production?
6. In what ways is a MNC different from other companies?
7. Nearly all major multinationals are American, Japanese or European,
such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honda, Nokia. Can you guess why?
For a long time foreign trade has been
the main channel connecting
countries. In history you would have
read about the trade routes
connecting India and South Asia to
markets both in the East and West
and the extensive trade that took place
along these routes. Also, you would
remember that it was trading interests
which attracted various trading
companies such as the East India
Company to India. What then is the
basic function of foreign trade?
To put it simply, foreign trade
creates an opportunity for the
producers to reach beyond the
domestic markets, i.e., markets of their
own countries. Producers can sell their
produce not only in markets located
within the country but can also
compete in markets located in other
countries of the world. Similarly, for the
buyers, import of goods produced in
another country is one way of
expanding the choice of goods beyond
what is domestically produced.
FOREIGN TRADE AND INTEGRATION OF
MARKETS
Ford Motors, an American
company, is one of the
world’s largest
automobile manufacturers
with production spread
over 26 countries of the
world. Ford Motors came
to India in 1995 and
spent Rs. 1700 crore to
set up a large plant near
Chennai. This was done
in collaboration with
Mahindra and Mahindra,
a major Indian
manufacturer of jeeps
and trucks. By the year
2004, Ford Motors was
selling 27,000 cars in the
Indian markets,
while 24,000 cars were
exported from India to
South Africa, Mexico and
Brazil. The company
wants to develop Ford
India as a component
supplying base for its
other plants across the
globe.

Chinese manufacturers learn
of an  opportunity to export toys
to India, where toys are sold at
a high price. They start
exporting plastic toys to India.
Buyers in India now have the
option of choosing between
Indian and the Chinese toys.
Because of the cheaper prices
and new designs, Chinese toys
become more popular in the
Indian markets. Within a year,
70 to 80 per cent of the toy
shops have replaced Indian
toys with Chinese toys. Toys
are now cheaper in the Indian
markets than earlier.
Let us see the effect of foreign trade
through the example of Chinese toys
in the Indian markets.
What is happening here? As a
result of trade, Chinese toys
come into the Indian markets.
In the competition between
Indian and Chinese toys,
Chinese toys prove better.
Indian buyers have a greater
choice of toys and at lower
prices. For the Chinese toy
makers, this provides an
opportunity to expand business.
The opposite is true for Indian
toy makers. They face losses,
as their toys are selling
much less.

(b) steel companies in India.

4. How will the import of steel from India into the Chinese markets lead to integration
of markets for steel in the two countries? Explain.
LET’S WORK THESE OUT
In general, with the opening of
trade, goods travel from one market
to another. Choice of goods in the
markets rises. Prices of similar goods
in the two markets tend to become
equal. And, producers in the two
countries now closely compete against
each other even though they are
separated by thousands of miles!
Foreign trade thus results in
connecting the markets or
integration of markets in  different
countries.
In the past two to three decades, more
and more MNCs have been looking for
locations around the world which
would be cheap for their production.
Foreign investment by MNCs in these
countries has been rising.  At the same
time, foreign trade between countries
has been rising rapidly. A large part
of the foreign trade is also controlled
by MNCs. For instance, the car
manufacturing plant of Ford Motors
in India not only produces cars for the
Indian markets, it also exports cars
to other developing countries and
exports car components for its many
factories around the world. Likewise,
activities of most MNCs involve
substantial trade in goods and also
services.

Technology
Rapid improvement in technology has been one major factor that has
stimulated the globalisation process. For instance, the past fifty years have
seen several improvements in transportation technology. This has made much
faster delivery of goods across long distances possible at lower costs.
The result of greater foreign
investment and greater foreign trade
has been greater integration of
production and markets across
countries. Globalisation is this
process of rapid integration or
interconnection between countries.
MNCs are playing a major role in
the globalisation process. More
and more goods and services,
investments and technology are
moving between countries. Most

contact with each other than a few
decades back.
Besides the movements of goods,
services, investments and technology,
there is one more way in which the
countries can be connected. This is
through the movement of people
between countries. People usually
move from one country to another in
search of better income, better jobs or
better education. In the past few
decades, however, there has not been
much increase in the movement of
people between countries due to
various restrictions.
Containers for
transport of goods
Goods are placed in containers
that can be loaded intact onto
ships, railways, planes and trucks.
Containers have led to huge
reduction in port handling costs
and increased the speed with
which exports can reach markets.
Similarly, the cost of air transport
has fallen.  This has enabled much
greater volumes of goods being
transported by airlines.

Liberalisation of foreign trade
and foreign investment
policy
Let us return to the example of imports
of Chinese toys in India. Suppose the
Indian government puts a tax on
import of toys. What would happen?
Those who wish to import these toys
would have to pay tax on this.
Because of the tax, buyers will have
to pay a higher price on imported toys.
Chinese toys will no longer be as
cheap  in the Indian markets and
imports from China will automatically
reduce. Indian toy-makers will
prosper.
Tax on imports is an example of
trade barrier. It is called a barrier
because some restriction has been set
up. Governments can use trade
barriers to increase or decrease
(regulate) foreign trade and to decide
what kinds of goods and how much
of each, should come into the country.
The Indian government, after
Independence, had put barriers to
foreign trade and foreign investment.
This was considered necessary to
protect the producers within the
country  from foreign competition.
Industries were just coming up in the
1950s and 1960s, and competition
from imports at that stage would not
have allowed these industries to come
up. Thus, India allowed imports
of only essential items such as
machinery, fertilisers, petroleum
etc. Note that all developed
countries, during the early stages of
development, have given protection to
domestic producers through a variety
of means.
Starting around 1991, some far-
reaching changes in policy were made
in India.  The government decided that
the time had come for Indian
producers to compete with producers
around the globe. It felt that
competition would improve the
performance of producers within the
country since they would have to
improve their quality. This decision
supported
powerful
international organisations.
Thus, barriers on foreign trade and
foreign investment were removed to a
large extent. This meant that goods
could be imported and exported
easily and also foreign companies
could set up factories and offices
here.
Removing barriers or restrictions
set by the government is what is
known as liberalisation. With
liberalisation of trade, businesses are
allowed to make decisions freely
about what they wish to import or
export. The government imposes
much less restrictions than before
and is therefore said to be more
liberal.
1. What do you understand by liberalisation of foreign trade?
2. Tax on imports is one type of trade barrier. The government could also place a limit on
the number of goods that can be imported. This is known as quotas.  Can you explain,
using the example of Chinese toys, how quotas can be used as trade barriers?
Do you think this should be used? Discuss.

rules regarding international trade,
and sees that these rules are obeyed.
Nearly 160 countries of the world are
currently members of the WTO (as on
June 2014).
Though WTO is supposed to allow
free trade for all, in practice, it is seen
that the developed countries have
unfairly retained trade barriers. On
the other hand, WTO rules have forced
the developing countries to remove
trade barriers. An example of this is
the current debate on trade in
agricultural products.
We have seen that the liberalisation of
foreign trade and investment in India
was supported by some very powerful
international organisations. These
organisations say that all barriers to
foreign trade and investment are
harmful. There should be no barriers.
Trade between countries should be
‘free’. All countries in the world should
liberalise their policies.
World Trade Organisation (WTO) is
one such organisation whose aim is
to liberalise international trade.
Started at the initiative of the
developed countries, WTO establishes

Developing countries are, therefore, asking the
developed country governments, “We have
reduced trade barriers as per WTO rules. But you
have ignored the rules of WTO and have
continued to pay your farmers vast sums of
money.  You have asked our governments to stop
supporting our farmers, but you are doing so
yourselves. Is this free and fair trade?”
You have seen in Chapter 2, that
the agriculture sector provides the
bulk of employment and a
significant portion of the GDP in
India. Compare this to a developed
country such as the US with the
share of agriculture in GDP at 1%
and its share in total employment
a tiny 0.5%! And yet this very
small percentage of people
engaged
agriculture in the US  receive
massive sums of money from
the US government for
production and for exports to
other countries. Due to this
massive money that they
receive, US farmers can sell
products
abnormally low prices. The
surplus farm products are
sold in other country markets
at low prices, adversely
affecting farmers in these
countries.
A typical cotton farm in USA consists of thousands of acres owned by
a huge corporation that will sell cotton abroad at lowered prices.

In the last twenty years, globalisation
of the Indian economy has come a
long way. What has been its effect on
the lives of people? Let us look at
some of the evidence.
Globalisation
greater
competition among producers - both
local and foreign producers - has been
of advantage to consumers,
particularly the well-off sections in the
urban areas. There is greater choice
before these consumers who now
enjoy improved quality and lower
prices for several products. As a result,
these people today, enjoy much
higher standards of living than was
possible earlier.
Among producers and workers,
the impact of globalisation has not
been uniform.
Firstly, MNCs have increased their
investments in India over the past 20
years, which means investing in India
has been beneficial for them. MNCs
have been interested in industries
such as cell phones, automobiles,
electronics, soft drinks, fast food or
services such as banking in urban
areas. These products have a large
number of well-off  buyers. In these
industries and services, new jobs have
been created. Also, local companies
supplying raw materials, etc. to these
industries have prospered.

2. What do you think can be done so that trade between countries is more fair?
3. In the above example, we saw that the US government gives massive sums of money
to farmers for production. At times, governments also give support  to promote production
of certain types of goods, such as those which are environmentally friendly. Discuss
whether these are fair or not.

are some Indian companies which
are spreading their operations
worldwide.
Globalisation has also created
new opportunities for companies
providing services, particularly those
involving IT. The Indian company
producing a magazine for the London
based company and call centres are
some examples.  Besides, a host of
services such as data entry, account-
ing, administrative tasks, engineering
are now being done cheaply in
countries such as India and are
exported to the developed countries.
Secondly, several of the top Indian
companies have been able to benefit
from the increased competition. They
have invested in newer technology and
production methods and raised their
production standards. Some have
gained from successful collaborations
with foreign companies.

LET’S WORK THESE OUT
In recent years, the central and state
governments in India are taking special
steps to attract foreign companies to
invest in India. Industrial zones, called
Special Economic Zones (SEZs), are
being set up. SEZs are to have world class
facilities: electricity, water, roads,
transport, storage, recreational and
educational facilities. Companies who set
up production units in the SEZs do not
have to pay taxes for an initial period of
five years.
Government has also allowed
flexibility in the labour laws to attract
foreign investment. You have seen in
Chapter 2 that the companies in the
organised sector have to obey certain
rules that aim to protect the workers’
rights. In the recent years, the government
has allowed companies to ignore many of
these. Instead of hiring workers on a
regular basis, companies hire workers
‘flexibly’ for short periods when there is
intense pressure of work. This is done to
reduce the cost of labour for the company.
However, still not satisfied, foreign
companies are demanding more flexibility
in labour laws.

Small producers: Compete or perish
For a large number of small producers and
workers globalisation has posed major
challenges.
Batteries, capacitors, plastics, toys, tyres, dairy products, and
vegetable oil are some examples of industries where the small
manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of the
units have shut down rendering many workers jobless. The small
industries in India employ the largest number of workers (20 million)
in the country, next only to agriculture.
1. What are the ways in which Ravi’s small production unit was affected by rising competition?
2. Should producers such as Ravi stop production because their cost of production is higher compared to
producers in other countries? What do you think?
3. Recent studies point out that small producers in India need three things to compete better in the market
(a) better roads, power, water, raw materials, marketing and information network (b) improvements and
modernisation of technology (c) timely availability of credit at reasonable interest rates.
Can you explain how these three things would help Indian producers?
Do you think MNCs will be interested in investing in these? Why?
Do you think the government has a role in making these facilities available? Why?
Can you think of any other step that the government could take? Discuss.

including capacitors in bulk for the
manufacture of television sets.
However, competition from the MNC
brands forced the Indian television
companies to move into assembling
activities for MNCs. Even when some
of them bought capacitors, they would
prefer to import as the price of the
imported item was half the price
charged by people like Ravi.
Ravi now produces less than half the
capacitors that he produced in the year
2000 and has only seven workers
working for him. Many of Ravi’s friends
in the same business in Hyderabad
and Chennai have closed their units.
Ravi did not expect that he would have
to face a crisis in such a short period
of his life as industrialist. Ravi took a
loan from the bank to start his own
company producing capacitors in 1992
in Hosur, an industrial town in Tamil
Nadu. Capacitors are used in many
electronic home appliances including
tube lights, television etc.  Within three
years, he was able to expand
production and had 20 workers
working under him.
His struggle to run his company started
when the government removed
restrictions on  imports of capacitors as
per its agreement at WTO in 2001. His

Competition and Uncertain Employment
Globalisation and the pressure of competition have substantially changed the lives
of workers. Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer to
employ workers ‘flexibly’. This means that workers’ jobs are no longer secure.

35 year old Sushila has spent many
years as a worker in garment export
industry of Delhi. She was employed
as a ‘permanent worker’ entitled to
health insurance, provident fund,
overtime at a double rate, when
Sushila’s factory closed in the late
1990s.  After searching for a job  for
six months, she finally got a job  30
km. away from where she lives. Even
after working in this factory for
several years, she is a temporary
worker and earns less than half of
what she was earning earlier.
Sushila leaves her house every
morning, seven days a week at 7:30
a.m. and returns at 10 p.m.  A day
off from work means no wage. She
has none of the benefits she used
to get earlier. Factories closer to her
home have widely fluctuating orders
and therefore pay even less.
Let us see how the workers in the garment export industry
in India are having to bear this pressure of competition.
Large MNCs in the garment industry in
Europe and America order their products
from Indian exporters. These large MNCs
with worldwide network look for the cheapest
goods in order to maximise their profits. To
get these large orders, Indian garment
exporters try hard to cut their own costs. As
cost of raw materials cannot be reduced,
exporters try to cut labour costs. Where
earlier a factory used to employ workers on
a permanent basis, now they employ workers
only on a temporary basis so that they do
not have to pay workers for the whole year.
Workers also have to put in very long
working hours and work night shifts on a
regular basis during the peak season. Wages
are low and workers are forced to work
overtime to make both ends meet.
While this competition among the garment
exporters has allowed the MNCs to make large
profits, workers are denied their fair share of
benefits brought about by globalisation.
Factory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for
women, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.

The conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above
have become common to many industrial units and services in India. Most
workers, today, are employed in the unorganised sector. Moreover, increasingly
conditions of work in the organised sector have come to resemble the
unorganised sector. Workers in the organised sector such as Sushila no longer
get the protection and benefits that they enjoyed earlier.
that labour laws are properly
implemented and the workers get
their rights. It can support small
producers
improve
their
performance till the time they become
strong enough to compete. If
necessary, the government can use
trade and investment barriers. It can
negotiate at the WTO for ‘fairer rules’.
It can also align with other developing
countries with similar interests to
fight against the domination of
developed countries in the WTO.
In the past few years, massive
campaigns and  representation by
people’s
organisations
influenced important decisions
relating to trade and investments at
the WTO. This has demonstrated
that people also can play an
important role in the struggle for fair
globalisation.
The above evidence indicates that
not everyone has benefited from
globalisation. People with education,
skill and wealth have made the best
use of the new opportunities. On the
other hand, there are many people
who have not shared the benefits.
Since globalisation is now a
reality, the question is how to
make globalisation more ‘fair’?
Fair globalisation would create
opportunities for all, and also ensure
that the benefits of globalisation are
shared better.
The government can play a major
role in making this possible. Its
policies must protect the interests, not
only of the rich and the powerful, but
all the people in the country. You have
read about some of the possible steps
that the government can take. For
instance, the government can ensure
1. In what ways has competition affected workers, Indian exporters and foreign MNCs
in the garment industry?
2. What can be done by each of the following so that the workers can get a fair share
of benefits brought by globalisation?
(a) government
(b) employers at the exporting factories
(c) MNCs
(d) workers.
3. One of the present debates in India is whether companies should have flexible
policies for employment. Based on what you have read in the chapter, summarise
the point of view of the employers and workers.

NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
This chapter proposes to discuss the issue of
consumer rights within the context of the ways
markets operate in our country. There are many
aspects of unequal situations in a market and
poor enforcement of rules and regulations. Hence,
there is a need to sensitise learners and encourage
them to participate in the consumer movement.
This chapter provides case histories – how some
consumers were exploited  in a real life situation
and how legal institutions helped consumers  in
getting compensated and in upholding their rights
as consumers. The case histories would enable
the students to link these narratives to their life
experiences. We have to enable students to
understand that the awareness of being a well-
informed consumer arose out of consumer
movement and active participation of people
through their struggles over a long period. This
chapter also provides details of a few
organisations helping consumers in different
ways. Finally it ends with some critical issues of
the consumer movement in India.
Aspects of Teaching / Sources of Information
This chapter has questions, case studies and
activities. It would be preferred that students
discuss these in groups orally. Some of these
could be answered in writing individually.
While carrying out each activity you could
start with a brainstorming session about the
activity. Similarly there are many opportunities
for role-play in this chapter and this could be a
useful way to share their experiences and
understand the issues at a deeper level. Making
posters collectively is another way to think about
these issues. This lesson contains activities,
which require visits – visit to consumer
protection councils, consumer organisations,
consumer court, retail shops, market places, etc.
Organise the visits to maximise learners’
experience.  Have a discussion with them about
the purpose of the visit, things they need to do
beforehand and things that need to be collected
and the task (report/ project / article, etc.) they
would carry out after the visit. As part of this
chapter, the learners may do letter-writing and
speaking activities. We may have to be sensitive
to the language aspect of exercises.
This chapter contains materials collected
from authenticated websites, books, newspapers
and magazines. For example, http://
www.mca.gov.in is a website of Central
Government Ministry of Consumer Affairs.
Another website www.cuts-international.org is the
website of a consumer organisation working in
India for more than 20 years. It publishes a
variety of materials to create consumer
awareness in India. They need to be shared
among learners so that they can also collect
materials as part of their activities. For example,
case histories were taken from newspaper
clippings and consumers who fought in
consumer courts. Let learners collect and read
such materials from different sources: consumer
protection councils, consumer courts and
internet.

CHAPTER 5
The collage you see below contains
some news clippings of consumer
court verdicts. Why did the people go
to the consumer court in these cases?
These verdicts came about because
some people persisted and struggled
to get justice. In what ways were they
denied justice? More importantly,
what are the ways in which they can
exercise their rights as consumers to
get a fair deal from the sellers when
they felt they had been denied a just
treatment?
2015-2016
We participate in the market both as
producers and consumers. As
producers of goods and services we
could be working in any of the sectors
discussed earlier such as agriculture,
industry, or services. Consumers
participate in the market when they
purchase goods and services that they
need. These are the final goods that
people as consumers use.
In the preceding chapters we
discussed the need for rules and
regulations or steps that would
promote development. These could be
for the protection of workers in the
unorganised sector or to protect
people from high interest rates
charged by moneylenders  in the
informal sector. Similarly, rules and
regulations are also required for
protecting the environment.
For example, moneylenders in the
informal sector that you read about
in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to
bind the borrower: they could make
the producer sell the produce to them
at a low rate in return for a timely loan;
they could force a small farmer like
Swapna to sell her land to pay back
the loan. Similarly, many people who
work in the unorganised sector have
to work at a low wage and accept
conditions that are not fair and are
also often harmful to their health. To
prevent such exploitation, we
have talked of rules and regulations
for their protection. There are
organisations that have struggled
for long to ensure that these rules are
followed.
THE CONSUMER IN THE MARKETPLACE
Likewise, rules and regulations are
required for the protection of the
consumers in the marketplace.
Individual consumers often find
themselves in a weak position.
Whenever there is a complaint
regarding a good or service that had
been bought, the seller tries to shift
all the responsibility on to the buyer.
Their position usually is – “If you
didn’t like what you bought, please
go elsewhere”. As if the seller has no
responsibility once a sale is
completed! The consumer movement,
as we shall discuss later, is an effort
to change this situation.
Exploitation in the marketplace
happens in various ways. For
example, sometimes traders indulge
in unfair trade practices such as when
shopkeepers weigh less than what
they should or when traders add
charges that were not mentioned
before, or when adulterated/defective
goods are sold.
Markets do not work in a fair
manner when producers are few and
powerful whereas consumers
purchase in small amounts and are
scattered. This happens especially
when large companies are producing
these goods. These companies with
huge wealth, power and reach can
manipulate the market in various
ways. At times false information is
passed on through the media, and
other sources to attract consumers.
For example, a company for years
sold powder milk for babies all over
THEY PURPOSELY MADE IT
SO IT WOULD FALL APART
AFTER A FEW MONTHS SO

CONSUMER MOVEMENT
quality of goods and services on the
sellers.
In India, the consumer movement
as a ‘social force’ originated with the
necessity of protecting and promoting
the interests of consumers against
unethical and unfair trade practices.
Rampant food shortages, hoarding,
black marketing, adulteration of food
and edible oil gave birth to the
consumer movement in an organised
form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s,
consumer organisations were largely
engaged in writing articles and
holding exhibitions. They formed
consumer groups to look into the
malpractices in ration shops and
overcrowding in the road passenger
transport. More recently, India
witnessed an upsurge in the number
of consumer groups.
The consumer movement arose out
of dissatisfaction of the consumers
as many unfair practices were being
indulged in by the sellers. There was
no legal system available to
consumers to protect them from
exploitation in the marketplace. For
a long time, when a consumer was
not happy with a particular brand
product or shop, he or she generally
avoided buying that brand product,
or would stop purchasing from that
shop. It was presumed that it was
the responsibility of consumers to be
careful while buying a commodity
or service. It took many years for
organisations in India, and around
the world, to create awareness
amongst people. This has also
shifted the responsibility of ensuring

LET’S WORK THESE OUT
Consumers International
In 1985 United Nations adopted
the UN Guidelines for Consumer
Protection. This was a tool for
nations to adopt measures to
protect consumers and for
consumer advocacy groups to
press their governments to do
so. At the international level, this
has become the foundation for
consumer movement. Today,
Consumers International has
become an umbrella body to
over 220 member organisations
from over 115 countries.
Because of all these efforts, the movement succeeded in
bringing pressure on business firms as well as government
to correct business conduct which may be unfair and against
the interests of consumers at large. A major step taken in
1986 by the Indian government was the enactment of the
Consumer Protection Act 1986, popularly known as COPRA.
You will learn more about COPRA later.

life. While using many goods and
services, we as consumers, have the
right to be protected against the
marketing of goods and delivery of
services that are hazardous to life and
property. Producers need to strictly
follow the required safety rules and
regulations. There are many goods
and services that we purchase that
require special attention to safety. For
example, pressure cookers have a
safety valve which, if it is defective, can
cause a serious accident. The
manufacturers of the safety valve have
to ensure high quality. You also need
public or government action to see
that this quality is maintained.
However, we do find bad quality
products in the market because the
supervision of these rules is weak and
the consumer movement is also not
strong enough.

because of which he was crippled for life.
His father filed a complaint in the State

Information about goods and
services
When you buy any commodity, you
will find certain details given on the
packing. These details are about
ingredients used, price, batch
number, date of manufacture, expiry
date and the address of the
manufactur er. When we buy
medicines, on the packets, you might
find ‘directions for proper use’ and
information relating to side effects and
risks associated with usage of that
medicine. When you buy garments,
you will find information on
‘instructions for washing’.
Why is it that rules have been made
so that the manufacturer displays this
information? It is because consumers
have the right to be informed about
the particulars of goods and services
that they purchase. Consumers
can then complain and ask for
compensation or replacement if the
product proves to be defective in any
manner. For example, if we buy a
product and find it defective well
within the expiry period, we can ask
for a replacement. If the expiry period
was not printed, the manufacturer
would blame the shopkeeper and will
not accept the responsibility. If people
sell medicines that have expired
severe action can be taken against
them. Similarly, one can protest and
complain if someone sells a good at
more than the printed price on the
packet. This is indicated by ‘MRP’ —
maximum retail price. In fact
consumers can bargain with the seller
to sell at less than the MRP.
In recent times, the right to
information has been expanded to
cover various services provided by the
Government. In October 2005, the
Government of India enacted a law,
popularly known as RTI (Right to
Information) Act, which ensures its
citizens all the information about the
functions of government departments.
The effect of the RTI Act can be
understood from the following case.

Abirami, a student of
Ansari Nagar, joined a two-
year course at a local
coaching institute for
professional courses in
New Delhi. At the time of
joining the course, she
paid the fees Rs 61,020
as lumpsum for the entire
course of two years.
However, she decided to opt out of the
course at the end of one year as she
found that the quality of teaching was
not up to the mark. When she asked
for a refund of the fee for one year, it
was denied to her.
When she filed the case in the District
Consumer Court, the Court directed
the Institute to refund Rs 28,000
saying that she had the right to
choose. The Institute
again appealed in the
State Consumer Com-
mission.
State
Commission upheld the
district court’s direction
and further fined the
institute Rs 25,000 for a
frivolous appeal. It also
directed the institute to
pay Rs 7000 as compensation and
litigation cost.
The State Commission also restrained
all the educational and professional
institutions in the state from charging
fees from students for the entire
duration of the course in advance and
that too at one go. Any violation of this
order may invite penalties and
imprisonment, the commission said.
if you buy a tooth brush. If you are
not interested in buying the brush,
your right to choice is denied. Similarly,
sometimes gas supply dealers insist
that you have to buy the stove from
them when you take a new connection.
In this way many a times you are
forced to buy things that you may not
wish to and you are left with no choice.
What do we understand from this
incident? Any consumer who receives a
service in whatever capacity, regardless
of age, gender and nature of service, has
the right to choose whether to continue
to receive the service.

Where should consumers go
to get justice?
Read again the cases of Reji Mathew
and Abirami given earlier in the
chapter.
These are some examples in which
consumers are denied their rights.
Such instances occur quite often in
our country. Where should these
consumers go to get justice?
Consumers have the right to seek
redressal against unfair trade
practices and exploitation. If any
damage is done to a consumer, she
has the right to get compensation

There is a need to provide an easy and

You might be interested in knowing
how an aggrieved person gets his or
her compensation. Let us take the
case of Prakash. He had sent a
money-order to his village for his
daughter’s marriage. The money did
not reach his daughter at the time
when she needed it nor did it reach
months later.  Prakash filed a case in
a district level consumer court in New
Delhi. All the steps he undertook are
illustrated here.

The consumer movement in India
has led to the formation of various
organisations locally known as
consumer forums or consumer
protection councils. They guide
consumers on how to file cases in the
consumer court. On many occasions,
they also represent individual
consumers in the consumer courts.
These voluntary organisations also
receive financial support from the
government for creating awareness
among the people.
If you are living in a residential
colony, you might have noticed
name boards of Resident Welfare
Associations. If there is any unfair
trade practice meted out to their
members they take up the case on
their behalf.
Arrange the following in the correct order.
(a) Arita files a case in the District Consumer Court.
(b) She engages a professional person.
(c) She realises that the dealer has given her defective
material.
(d) She starts attending the court proceedings.
(e) She goes and complains to the dealer and the Branch
office, to no effect.
(f) She is asked to produce the bill and warranty before
the court.
(g) She purchases a wall clock from a retail outlet.
(h) Within a few months, the dealer was ordered by the
court to replace her old wall clock with a brand new
one at no extra cost.

LEARNING TO BECOME WELL-INFORMED
CONSUMERS
When we as consumers become conscious of our rights,
while purchasing various goods and services, we will be
able to discriminate and make informed choices. This
calls for acquiring the knowledge and skill to become a
well-informed consumer. How do we become conscious
Under COPRA, a three-tier quasi-
judicial machinery at the district,
state and national levels was set up
for redressal of consumer disputes.
The district level court deals with the
cases involving claims upto Rs 20
lakhs, the state level courts between
Rs 20 lakhs and Rs 1 crore and the
national level court deals with cases
involving claims exceeding Rs 1 crore.
If a case is dismissed in district level
court, the consumer can also appeal
in state and then in National level
courts.
Thus, the Act has enabled us as
consumers to have the right to
represent in the consumer courts.

the right and in the previous page.
What do you think?
The enactment of COPRA has led
to the setting up of separate
departments of Consumer Affairs in
central and state governments. The
posters that you have seen are one
example through which government

While buying many commodities, on the
cover, you might have seen a logo with the
letters ISI, Agmark or Hallmark. These
logos and certification help consumers get
assured of quality while purchasing the
goods and services. The organisations that
monitor and issue these certificates allow
producers to use their logos provided they
follow certain quality standards.
Though these organisations develop
quality standards for many products, it is
not compulsory for all the producers to
follow standards. However, for some
products that affect the health and safety
of consumers or of products of mass
consumption like LPG cylinders, food
colours and additives, cement, packaged
drinking water, it is mandatory on the part
of the producers to get certified by these
organisations.

India has been observing 24
December as the National Consumers’
Day. It was on this day that the Indian
Parliament enacted the Consumer
Protection Act in 1986. India is one
of the countries that have exclusive
courts for consumer redressal.
The consumer movement in India
has made some progress in terms of
numbers of organised groups and
their activities. There are today more
than 700 consumer groups in the
country of which only about 20-25
are well organised and recognised for
their work.
However, the consumer redressal
process is becoming cumbersome,
expensive and time consuming. Many
a time, consumers are required to
engage lawyers. These cases require

What is the difference between consumer protection council and consumer court?
The Consumer Protection Act 1986 ensures the following as rights which every
consumer in India should possess
(i) Right to choice.
Right to representation.
(ii) Right to information.
Right to safety.
(iii) Right to redressal.
Right to consumer education.
Categorise the following cases under different heads and mark against each in
brackets.
(a) Lata got an electric shock from a newly purchased iron. She complained to the
shopkeeper immediately. (      )
(b) John is dissatisfied with the services provided by MTNL/BSNL/TATA INDICOM
for the past few months. He files a case in the District Level Consumer Forum.

(c) Your friend has been sold a medicine that has crossed the expiry date and you
are advising her to lodge a complaint (      ).
(d) Iqbal makes it a point to scan through all the particulars given on the pack of any
item that he buys. (      )
(e) You are not satisfied with the services of the cable operator catering to your
locality but you are unable to switch over to anybody else.  (      )
(f) You realise that you have received a defective camera from a dealer. You are
complaining to the head office persistently (      ).

time for filing and attending the court
proceedings etc. In most purchases
cash memos are not issued hence
evidence is not easy to gather.
Moreover most purchases in the
market are small retail sales. The
existing laws also are not very clear
on the issue of compensation to
consumers injured by defective
products. After more than 25 years
of the enactment of COPRA, consumer
awareness in India is spreading but
slowly. Besides this the enforcement
EXERCISES
of laws that protect workers,
especially in the unorganised sectors
is weak. Similarly, rules and
regulations for working of markets are
often not followed.
Nevertheless, there is scope for
consumers to realise their role and
importance. It is often said that
consumer movements can be effective
only with the consumers’ active
involvement. It requires a voluntary
effort and struggle involving the
participation of one and all.

4. Prepare posters with catchy slogans like:
An alert consumer is a safe consumer
Buyers, Beware
Consumers be cautious
Be aware of your rights
As consumers, assert your right
Arise, awake and stop not till ______________________ (Complete it)
