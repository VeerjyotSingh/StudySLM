company form of organisation is the third stage
in the evolution of forms of organisation. Its
capital is contributed by a large number of persons
called shareholders who are the real owners of the
company. But neither it is possible for all of them to
participate in the management of the company nor
considered desirable. Therefore, they elect a Board
of Directors as their representative to manage the
affairs of the company. In fact, all the affairs of the
company are governed by the provisions of the
Companies Act, 1956. A company means a company
incorporated or registered under the Companies Act,
1956 or under any other earlier Companies Acts.
According to Chief Justice Marshal, “a company is
a person, artificial, invisible, intangible and existing
only in the eyes of law. Being a mere creation of law,
it possesses only those properties which the charter
of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as
incidental to its very existence”.
A company usually raises its capital in the form of
shares (called share capital) and debentures (debt
capital.) This chapter deals with the accounting for
share capital of companies.
Features of a Company
A company may be viewed as an association of
person who contribute money or money’s worth to
a common stock and use it for a common purpose.
It is an artificial person having or corporate legal
entity distinct from its members (shareholders) and
has a common seal used for its signature. Thus, it

has certain special features which distinguish it from the other forms of
organisation. These are as follows:
Voluntary Association: persons who are willing to form a company can
come together voluntarily for carrying on a business. Therefore, it is
regarded as a voluntary association of persons.
Separate Legal Entity: A company has a separate legal entity which is
distinct and separate from its members. It can hold and deal with any
type of property. It can enter into contracts and even open a bank account
in its own name. It can sue others as well as be sued by others.
Limited Liability: The liability of the members of the company is limited
to the unpaid amount of the shares held by them. In the case of the
companies limited by guarantee, the liability of its members is limited to
the extent of the guarantee given by them in the event of the company
being wound up.
Perpetual Succession: The company being an artificial person created
by law continues to exist irrespactive of the changes in its membership.
A company can be terminated only through law. The death or insanity
or insolvency of any member of the company in no way affects the
existence of the company. Members may come and go but the company
continues.
Common Seal: The company being an artificial person, cannot sign its
name by it self. Therefore, every company is required to have its own seal
which acts as an official signatures of the company. Any document which
does not carry the common seal of the company is not binding on the
company.
Transferability of Shares: The shares of a public limited company are
freely transferable. The permission of the company or the consent of any
member of the company is not necessary for the transfer of shares. But
the Articles of the company can prescribe the manner in which the transfer
of shares will be made.
May Sue or be Sued: A company being a legal person can enter into
contracts and can enforce the contractual rights against others. It can
sue and be sued in its name if there is a breach of contract by the company.
Kinds of a Company
Companies can be classified either on the basis of the liability of its members or
on the basis of the number of members. On the basis of liability of its members
the companies can be classified into the following three categories:
Companies Limited by Shares: In this case, the liability of its members is
limited to the extent of the nominal value of shares held by them. If a
member has paid the full amount of the shares, there is no liability on
his part whatsoever may be the debts of the company. He need not pay a

single paise from his private property. However, if there is any liability
involved, it can be enforced during the existence of the company as well
as during the winding-up.
Companies Limited by Guarantee: In this case, the liability of its members
is limited to the amount they undertake to contribute in the event of the
company being wound up. Thus, the liability of the members will arise
only in the event of its winding up.
(iii)
Unlimited Companies: When there is no limit on the liability of its
members, the company is called an unlimited company. When the
company’s property is not sufficient to pay off its debts, the private
property of its members can be used for the purpose. In other words, the
creditors can claim their dues from its members. Such companies are
not found in India even though permitted by the Companies Act, 1956.
On the basis of the number of members, a company can be divided into two
categories as follows:
Public Company: A public company means a company which (a) is not a
private company, (b) has minimum capital of Rs. 5 lakh on such higher
paid-up capital may be prescribed, and (c) is a private company which is
a subsidiary of which is not a private company.
Private Company: A private company is one which has a minimum paid up
capital of Rs. 1 Lakh or such higher paid-up capital as may be prescribed by its
Articles :
restricts the right to transfer its shares;
(b) limits the number of its members to fifty (excluding its employees);
prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares in or
debentures of the company.
(d) prohihibits any invitation or acceptance of deposits from person other
than its members, directors, and relatives.
Share Capital of a Company
A company, being an artificial person, cannot generate its own capital which
has necessarily to be collected from several persons. These persons are known
as shareholders and the amount contributed by them is called share capital.
Since the number of shareholders is very very large, a separate capital account
cannot be opened for each one of them. Hence, innumerable streams of capital
contribution merge their identities in a common capital account called as ‘Share
Capital Account’.
1.3.1 Categories of Share Capital
From accounting point of view the share capital of the company can be classified
as follows:
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Authorised Capital: Authorised capital is the amount of share capital
which a company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum of
Association. The company cannot raise more than the amount of capital
as specified in the Memorandum of Association. It is also called Nominal
or Registered capital. The authorised capital can be increased or
decreased as per the procedure laid down in the Companies Act. It should
be noted that the company need not issue the entire authorised capital
for public subscription at a time. Depending upon its requirement, it
may issue share capital but in any case, it should not be more than the
amount of authorised capital.
Issued Capital: It is that part of the authorised capital which is actually
issued to the public for subscription including the shares allotted to
vendors and the signatories to the company’s memorandum. The
authorised capital which is not offered for public subscription is known
as ‘unissued capital’. Unissued capital may be offered for public
subscription at a later date.
Subscribed Capital: It is that part of the issued capital which has been
actually subscribed by the public. When the shares offered for public
subscription are subscribed fully by the public the issued capital and
subscribed capital would be the same. It may be noted that ultimately,
the subscribed capital and issued capital are the same because if the
number of share, subscribed is less than what is offered, the company
allot only the number of shares for which subscription has been received.
In case it is higher than what is offered, the allotment will be equal to the
offer. In other words, the fact of over subscription is not reflected in the
books.
Called-up Capital: It is that part of the subscribed capital which has
been called up on the shares. The company may decide to call the entire
amount or part of the face value of the shares. For example, if the face
value (also called nominal value) of a share allotted is Rs. 10 and the
company has called up only Rs. 7 per share, in that scenario, the called
up capital is Rs. 7 per share. The remaining Rs. 3 may be collected from
its shareholders as and when needed.
Paid-up Capital: It is that portion of the called up capital which has been
actually received from the shareholders. When the share holders have
paid all the call amount, the called-up capital is the same to the paid-up
capital. If any of the shareholders has not paid amount on calls, such an
amount may be called as ‘calls in arrears’. Therefore, paid-up capital is
equal to the called-up capital minus call-in-arrears.
Uncalled Capital: That portion of the subscribed capital which has not
yet been called-up. As stated earlier, the company may collect this amount
any time when it needs further funds.
Accounting for Share Capital
Reserve Capital: A company may reserve a portion of its uncalled capital
to be called only in the event of winding up of the company. Such uncalled
amount is called ‘Reserve Capital’ of the company. It is available only for
the creditors on winding up of the company.

Fig. 1.1 : Categories of Share Capital
Let us take the following example and show how the share capital will be
shown in the balance sheet. Sunrise Company Ltd., New Delhi, has registered
its capital as Rs. 40,00,000, divided into 4,00,000 shares of Rs. 10 each. The
company offered to the public for subscription of 2,00,000 shares of Rs. 10
each, as Rs. 2 on application, Rs.3 on allotment, Rs.3 on first call and the balance
on final call. The company received applications for 2,50,000 shares. The
company finalised the allotment on 2,00,000 shares and rejected applications
for 50,000 shares. The company did not make the final call. The company received
all the amount except on 2,000 shares where call money has not been received.
The above amounts will be shown in the balance sheet of a company as follows:

Nature and Classes of Shares
Shares, as applied to the capital of a company, refer to the units into which the
total share capital of a company is divided. Thus, a share is a fractional part of
the share capital and forms the basis of ownership interest in a company. The
persons who contribute money through shares are called shareholders.
The amount of authorised capital, together with the number of shares in
which it is divided, is stated in the Memorandum of Association but the classes
of shares in which the company’s capital is to be divided, alongwith their
respective rights and obligations, are prescribed by the Articles of Association of
the company. As per Section 86 of The Companies Act, a company can issue
two types of shares (1) preference shares, and (2) equity shares (also called
ordinary shares).
1.4.1 Preference Shares
According to Section 85 of The Companies Act, 1956, a preference share is one,
which fulfils the following conditions :
That it carries a preferential right to dividend to be paid either as a
fixed amount payable to preference shareholders or an amount
calculated by a fixed rate of the nominal value of each share before
any dividend is paid to the equity shareholders.
That with respect to capital it carries or will carry, on the winding-up
of the company, the preferential right to the repayment of capital before
anything is paid to equity shareholders.
However, notwithstanding the above two conditions, a holder of the preference
share may have a right to participate fully or to a limited extent in the surpluses
of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles of the company.
Thus, the preference shares can be participating and non-participating. Similarly,
these shares can be cumulative or non-cumulative, and redeemable or
irredeemable.
Accounting for Share Capital
1.4.2 Equity Shares
According to Section 85 of The Companies Act, 1956, an equity share is a share
which is not a preference share. In other words, shares which do not enjoy any
preferential right in the payment of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed
as equity shares. The equity shareholders are entitled to share the distributable
profits of the company after satisfying the dividend rights of the preference share
holders. The dividend on equity shares is not fixed and it may vary from year to
year depending upon the amount of profits available for distribution. The equity
share capital may be (i) with voting rights; or (ii) with differential rights as to
voting, dividend or otherwise in accordance with such rules and subject to such
conditions as may be prescribed.

(o) Forfeited shares can not be issued at a discount.
(p) The shares originally issued at discount may be re-issued at a premium.
Issue of Shares
A salient characteristic of the capital of a company is that the amount on its
shares can be gradually collected in easy instalments spread over a period of
time depending upon its growing financial requirement. The first instalment is
collected along with application and is thus, known as application money, the
second on allotment (termed as allotment money), and the remaining instalment
are termed as first call, second call and so on. The word final is sufixed to the
last instalment. However, this in no way prevents a company from calling the
full amount on shares right at the time of application.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
The important steps in the procedure of share issue are :
Issue of Prospectus: The company first issues the prospectus to the
public. Prospectus is an invitation to the public that a new company has
come into existence and it needs funds for doing business. It contains
complete information about the company and the manner in which the
money is to be collected from the prospective investors.
Receipt of Applications: When prospectus is issued to the public,
prospective investors intending to subscribe the share capital of the
company would make an application along with the application money
and deposit the same with a scheduled bank as specified in the
prospectus. The company has to get minimum subscription (Refer Box
1) within 120 days from the date of the issue of the prospectus. If the
company fails to receive the same within the said period, the company
cannot proceed for the allotment of shares and application money should
be returned within 130 days of the date of issue of prospectus.
Allotment of Shares: If minimum subscription has been received, the
company may proceed for the allotment of shares after fulfilling certain
other legal formalities. Letters of allotment are sent to those whom the
shares have been alloted, and letters of regret to those to whom no
allotment has been more. When allotment is made, it results in a valid
contract between the company and the applicants who now became the
shareholders of the company.
Box 1
Minimum Subscription
It means the minimum amount that, in the opinion of directors, must be raised to
meet the needs of business operations of the company relating to:·
 the price of any property purchased, or to be purchased, which has to be met
wholly or partly out of the proceeds of issue;
 preliminary expenses payable by the company and any commission payable
in connection with the issue of shares;
 the repayment of any money borrowed by the company for the above two
matters;
 working capital; and
 any other expenditure required for the usual conduct of business operations.
It is to be noted that ‘minimum subscription’ of capital cannot be less than 90%
of the issued amount according to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection)
Guidelines, 2000 [6.3.8.1 and 6.3.8.2]. If this condition is not satisfied, the company
shall forthwith refund the entire subscription amount received. If a delay occurs
beyond 8 days from the date of closure of subscription list, the company shall be
liable to pay the amount with interest at the rate of 15% [Section 73(2)].
Accounting for Share Capital
Shares of a company are issued either at par, at a premium or at a discount.
Shares are said to have been issued at par when their issue price is exactly
equal to their nominal value according to the terms and conditions of issue.
When the shares of a company are issued more than its nominal value (face
value), the excess amount is called premium and the issue is said to have been
made at a premium. When the shares are issued at a price less than the face
value of the share, it is known as shares issued at a discount.
Irrespective of the fact that shares are issued at par, premium or discount,
the share capital of a company as stated earlier, is collected in instalments to be
paid at different stages.
Accounting Treatment
On application : The amount of money paid with various instalment represents
the contribution to share capital and should ultimately be credited to share
capital. However, for the sake of convenience, initially individual accounts are
opened for each instalment. All money received along with application is
deposited with a scheduled bank in a separate account opened for the purpose.
The journal entry is as follows:
Bank A/c
To Share Application A/c
(Amount received on application for — shares @ Rs. ______ per share).
On allotment : When minimum subscription has been received and certain legal
formalities on the allotment of shares have been duly complied with, the directors
of the company proceed to make the allotment of shares.
The allotment of shares implies a contract between the company and the
applicants who now become the allottees and assume the status of share-holders
or members.
Box 2
Allotment of Shares
(Implications from accounting point of view)
 It is customary to ask for some amount called “Allotment Amount” from the
allottees on the shares allotted to them as soon as the allotment is made.
 With the acceptance to the offer made by the applicants, the amount of
application money received has to be transferred to share capital account as it
has formally become the part of the same.
 The money received on rejected applications should either be fully returned to
the applicant within 130 days of the date or issue of prospectus, or
 In case lesser number of shares have to be allotted, than those applied for the
excess application money must be adjusted towards the amount due on allotment
from the allottees.
 The effect of the later two steps is to close the share application account which
is only a temporary account for share capital transactions.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
The journal entries with regard to allotment of shares are as follows:
For Transfer of Application Money
Share Application A/c
To Share Capital A/c
(Application money on _____ Shares allotted/

For Money refunded on rejected application
Share Application A/c

adjusted to the amount due on allotment).
For Receipt of Allotment Amount
Bank A/c
To Share Allotment A/c
(Allotment money received on — Shares @
Rs. — per share Combined Account)
Sometimes a combined account for share application and share allotment called
‘Share Application and Allotment Account’ is opened in the books of a company.
The combined account is based on the reasoning that allotment without
application is impossible while application without allotment is meaningless.
These two stages of share capital are closely inter-related. When a combined
account is maintained, journal entries are recorded in the following manner:
For Receipt of Application and Allotment
Bank A/c
To Share Application and Allotment A/c
(Money received on applications for shares
@ Rs. _____ per share).
For Transfer of Application Money and Allotment Amount Due
Share Application and Allotment A/c

(Application money returned on rejected application

On Receipt of Allotment Amount
Bank A/c

(Balance of Allotment Money Received).
On Calls :  Calls play a vital role in making shares fully paid-up and for realising
the full amount of shares from the shareholders. In the event of shares not being
fully called-up till the completion of allotment, the directors have the authority
to ask for the remaining amount on shares as and when they decide about the
same. It is also possible that the timing of the payment of calls by the shareholders
is determined at the time of share issue itself and given in the prospectus.
Two points are important regarding the calls on shares. First, the amount
on any call should not exceed 25% of the face value of shares. Second, there
must be an interval of at least one month between the making of two calls unless
otherwise provided by the articles of association of the company.
When a call is made and the amount of the same is received, the journal
entries are as given below:
For Call Amount Due
Share Call A/c
To Share Capital A/c
(Call money due on — Shares @ Rs. ____ per share)
For Receipt of Call Amount
Bank A/c
To Share Call A/c
(Call money received)
The word/words First, Second, or Third must be added between the words
“Share” and ‘Call’ in the Share Call account depending upon the identity of the
call made. For example, in case of first call it will be termed as ‘Share First Call
Account’, in case of second call it will be ‘Share Second Call Account’ and so on.
Another point to be noted is that the words ‘and Final’ will also be added to the
last call, say, if second call is the last call it will be termed as ‘Second and Final
Call’ and if it is the third call which is the last call, it will be termed as ‘Third and
Final Call’. It is also possible that the whole balance after allotment may be
collected in one call only. In that case the first call itself, shall be termed as the
‘First and Final Call’.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Box 3
The following points should be kept in mind while issuing the share capital for
public subscription :
The application money should be at least 5% of the face value of the share.
Calls are to be made as per the provisions of the articles of association.
Where there is no articles of association of its own, the following provisions
of Table A will apply:
A period of one month must elapse between two calls;
The amount of call should not exceed 25% of the face value of the share;
A minimum of 14 days’ notice is given to the shareholders to pay the
amount; and
Calls must be made on a uniform basis on all shares within the same
class.
Note: The procedure for accounting for the issue of both equity and preference shares
is the same. To differentiate between the two the words ‘Equity’ and ‘Preference’ is
prefixed to each and every instalment.

of Rs. 40,000 divided into shares of Rs. 10 each. It offered to the public for subscription
of 3,000 shares payable as follows:
On Application
Rs. 3 per share
On Allotment
Rs. 2 per share
On First Call (One month after allotment)
Rs. 2.50 per share
On Second and Final Call
Rs. 2.50 per share
The shares were fully subscribed for by the public and application money duly
received on January 15, 2006. The directors made the allotment on February 1, 2006.
How will you record the share capital transactions in the books of a company if
the amounts due has been duly received, and the company maintains the combined
account for application and allotment.
Accounting for Share Capital
1.6.1 Calls in Arrears
It often happens that shareholders do not pay the call amount when it becomes
due. When any shareholder fails to pay the amount due on allotment or on any
of the calls, such amount is known as ‘Calls-in-Arrears’/‘Unpaid Calls’. Calls-
in-Arrears represent the debit balance of all the calls account and are shown as
a deduction from the paid-up capital on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.
However, where a company maintains ‘Calls-in-Arrears’ Account, it needs to
pass the following additional journal entry. However, it is not necessary to do
Calls in Arrears A/c
To Share I Call Account A/c
To Share II and Final Call Account A/c
(Calls in arrears brought into account)
The Articles of Association of a company usually empower the directors to
change interest at a stipulated rate on calls in arrears. In case the articles are
silent in this regard, the rule contained in Table A shall be applicable which
states that the interest at a rate not exceeding 5% p.a. shall have to be paid on
all unpaid amounts on shares for the period intervening between the day fixed
for payment and the time of actual payment thereon.
On receipt of the call amount together with interest, the amount of interest
shall be credited to interest account while call money shall be credited to the
respective call account or to calls-in-arrears account. When the shareholder
makes the payment of calls-in-arrears together with interest, the entry will be as
follows:
Bank A/c
To Calls-in-Arrears A/c
To Interest A/c
If nothing is specified, there is no need to take
the interest on calls-in-arrears account and
record the above entry

1.6.2 Calls in Advance
Sometimes some shareholders pay a part or the whole of the amount of the calls
not yet made. The amount so received from the shareholders is known as “Calls
in Advance”. The amount received in advance is a liability of the company and
should be credited to ‘Call-in-Advance Account.” The amount received will be
adjusted towards the payment of calls as and when they becomes due. Table A
of the Companies Act provides for the payment of interest on calls in advance at
a rate not exceeding 6% per annum.
The following journal entry is recorded for the amount of calls received in
advance.
Bank A/c
To Calls-in-Advance A/c
(Amount received on call-in-advance)
When calls become actually due requiring adjustment of ‘Call-in-Advance’
Account, the journal entry will be :
Calls-in-Advance A/c
To Particular Call A/c
(Calls-in-advance adjusted with the call money due)
The balance in ‘Calls-in-Advance’ account is shown as a separate item on
the liabilities side of company’s balance sheet under the heading ‘Share Capital’
but is not added to the amount of paid-up capital.
As Calls-in-Advance is a liability of the company, it is under obligation if
provided by the Articles, to pay interest on such amount from the date of its
receipt up to the date when appropriate call is due for payment. A stipulation is
generally made in the Articles regarding the rate at which interest is payable.
However, if Articles are silent on this account, Table A is applicable which provides
for interest on calls in advance at a rate not exceeding 6% p.a.
The accounting treatment of interest on calls in advance is as follows:
For Payment of Interest

For Interest due

Pass journal entries and prepare the Balance Sheet of the company as on
December 31, 2005.
2. Alfa company Ltd. issued 10,000 shares of Rs.10 each for cash payable at Rs.3

The allotment money was payable on or before March 3, 2006; the first call
money on or before 30 June, 2006; and the final call money on or before 31st
August, 2006. Mr. ‘A’, whom 600 shares were allotted, paid the entire remaining

1.6.3 Over Subscription
There are instances when applications for more shares of a company are received
than the number offered to the public for subscription. This usually happens in
respect of share issues of well-managed and financially strong companies and
is said to be a case of ‘Over Subscription’.
In such a condition, three alternatives are available to the directors to deal
with the situation: (1) they can accept some applications in full and totally reject
the others;  (2) they can make a pro-rata allotment to all; and  (3) they can adopt
a combination of the above two alternatives which happens to be the most
common course adopted in practice.
The problem of over subscription is finally resolved with the allotment of
shares. Therefore, from the accounting point of view, it is better to place the
situation of over subscription within the total frame of application and allotment,
i.e. receipt of application amount, amount due on allotment and its receipt from
the shareholders, and the same has been observed in the pattern of entries.
First Alternative : When the directors decide to fully accept some applications
and totally reject the others, the application money received from rejected
applications is fully refunded. For example, a company invited applications for
20,000 shares and received the applications for 25,000 shares. The directors
totally rejected the applications for 5,000 shares which are in excess of the
required number and refunded their application money in full. In this case, the
journal entries on application and allotment will be as follows :
The journal entries on application and allotment according to this alternative
are as follows:

Share Allotment A/c
To Share Capital A/c
(Amount due on the allotment of _ shares
@ Rs. _ per Share)
Bank A/c
To Share Allotment A/c
(Allotment money received)
Second Alternative : When the directors opt to make a proportionate allotment
to all the applicants (called ‘pro-rata’ allotment), the excess application money
received is normally adjusted towards the amount due on allotment. In case,
however, the excess application money received is more than the amount due
on allotment of shares, such excess amount may either be refunded or credited
to calls in advance.
For example, in the event of applications for 20,000 shares being invited
and those received are for 25,000 shares, it is decieded to allot shares in the
ratio of 4:5 to all applicants. It is a case of pro-rata allotment and the excess
application money received on 5,000 shares would be adjusted towards the
amount due on the allotment of 20,000 shares. In this case, the journal entries
on application and allotment will be as follows.

Third Alternative : When the application for some shares are rejected outrightly;
and pro-rata allotment is made to the remaining applicants, the money on rejected
applications is fully refunded and the excess application money received from
applicants to whom prorata allotment has been made is adjusted towrds the
amount due on the allotment of shares allotted.
For example, a company invited applications for 10,000 shares and received
applications for 15,000 shares. the directors decided to reject the applications
for 2,500 shares outright and to make a pro-rata allotment of 10,000 shares to
the applicants for the remaining 12,500 shares so that four shares are allotted
for every five shares applied. In this case, the money on applications for 2,500
shares rejected would be refunded fully and that on the remaining 2,500 shares
(12,500 shares – 10,000 shares) would be adjusted against the allotment amount
due on 10,000 shares allotted and credited to share allotment account, the
journal entries on application and allotment recorded as follows:

example, a comapny offered 2 lakh shares for subscription to the public but the
applications were received for 1,90,000 share, only. In such a situation, the
Accounting for Share Capital
allotment will be confirmed to 1,90,000 share and entries shall be made
accordingly. However, as stated earlier, it must be ensured that the company
has received the minimum subscriptions (not less than 90% of the offer otherwise
the procedure for issue of shares cannot proceed further and the company will
have to refund the entire subscription amount received.
1.6.5 Issue of Shares at a Premium
It is quite common for the shares of financially strong and well-managed
companies to be issued at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal
or par value of shares. Thus, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is
issued at Rs. 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent.
When the issue of shares is at a premium, the amount of premium may
technically be called at any stage of the issue of shares. However, premium is
generally called with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the
application money and rarely with the call money. The premium amount is
credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Account’ and is shown
on the liabilities side of the company’s balance sheet under the heading ‘Reserves
and Surpluses’. It can be used only for the following four purposes as laid down
by Section 78 of The Companies Act 1956:
to issue fully paid bonus shares to an extent not exceeding unissued
share capital of the company;
to write-off preliminary expenses of the company;
to write-off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed
on any of the shares or debentures of the company; and
to pay premium on the redemption of preference shares or debentures
of the company.

1.6.6 Issue of Shares at a Discount
There are instances when the shares of a company are issued at a discount, i.e.
at an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares, the difference between
the nominal value and issue price representing discount on the issue of shares.
For example, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is issued at Rs. 98, it
is said to have been issued at a discount of two per cent.
As a general rule, a company cannot ordinarily issue shares at a discount. It
can do so only in cases such as ‘reissue of forfeited shares’ (to be discussed
later) and in accordance with the provisions of section 79 of The Companies Act.
It states that, a company is permitted to issue shares at a discount provided
the following conditions are satisfied:
The issue of shares at a discount is authorised by an ordinary
resolution passed by the company at its general meeting and
sanctioned by the Company Law Board now Central Government.
The resolution must specify the maximum rate of discount at which
the shares are to be issued but the rate of discount must not exceed
10 per cent of the nominal value of shares. The rate of discount can be
more than 10 per cent if the Government is convinced that a higher
rate is called-for under special circumstances of a case.
At least one year must have elapse since the date on which the
company became entitled to commence the business.
The shares are of a class which has already been issued.
The shares issued within two months from the date of receiving sanction
for the same from the Government or within such extended period as
the Government may allow.
If the offer prospectus at the date of issue must mention particulars of
the discount allowed on the issue of shares.
Whenever shares are issued at a discount, the amount of discount is brought
into the books at the time of allotment by debiting an account called ‘Discount
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
on the Issue of Shares Account’. The journal entry to be passed for the purpose
is as given below:
Share Allotment A/c
Discount on the Issue of Shares  A/c
Share Capital A/c
(Amount due on allotment of — shares
@ Rs — per share and discount on issue
brought into account.)
‘Discount on the Issue of Shares Account’,havingadebitbalance,denotes aloss
to the company and is shown on the asset side of the company’s balance sheet
under heading ‘Miscellaneous Expenditure’.It is written-off by being charging
it to the Securities Premium Account if any and, in its absence, by being gradually
charged to the Profit and Loss Account over a period of 5 to 10 years.

1.6.7 Issue of Shares for Consideration other than Cash
There are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the
vendors from whom it has purchased assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept,
the payment in the form of fully paid shares of the company issued to them.
Normally, no cash is received for such issue of shares. These shares can also be
issued either at par, at premium or at discount, and the number of shares to be
issued  will depend upon the price at which the shares are issued and the amount
payable to the vendor.  Thus, to find out the number of shares to be issued to
the vendor will be calculated as follows:
Amount Payable
No. of shares to be issued
Issue Price
For example, Rahul Limited purchased building from Handa Limited for
Rs.5,40,000 and the payment is to be made by the issue of shares of Rs.100
each. The number of shares to be issued shall be worked out as follows in different
situations :

Forfeiture of Shares
It may happen that some shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments, viz.
allotment money and/or call money. In such circumstances, the company can
forfeit their shares, i.e. cancel their allotment and treat the amount already
received thereon as forfeited to the company within the framework of the
Accounting for Share Capital
provisions in its articles. There provisions are usually based on Regulations 29
to 35 of the Table A which authorise, the directors to forefeit the shares for non-
payment of calls made. For this purpose, they have to strictly follow the procedure
laid down in this regard.
When shares are forefeited all entries relating to the shares forfeited, except
those relating to premium, already recorded in the accounting records, must be
reversed. Accordingly, share capital account is debited with the amount called-
up in respect of shares are forfeited and crediting (i) the espective unpaid calls
account’s or calls in arrears account, as the case may be will the unpaid amount,
and (ii) share foreited account with the amount already received. Thus, the journal
entry will be as follows:
Share Capital A/c
To Share Forfeiture A/c
To Share Allotment A/c
To Share Calls A/c (individually)
(..... shares forfeited for non-payment of
allotment money and calls made)
Note :
In case ‘Calls-in-Arrears’ account is maintained by a company, ‘Calls-in-Arrears’
account would be credited in the above entry instead of ‘Share Allotment’ and/or
‘Share Call or Calls’ account.
The balance of shares forfeited account is shown as an addition to the total
paid-up capital of the company under the heading ‘Share Capital’ on the liabilities
side of the balance sheet till the forfeited shares are reissued.

Forfeiture of Shares issued at a Premium: Where shares were originally issued
at a premium and the premium amount has been fully realised, and later on
some share are forfeited due to non-payment of call money, the accounting
treatment of forfeiture would be on the same pattern as in the case of shares
issued at par. The important point to be noted in this context is that the share
premium account is not to be debited at the time of forfeiture if the premium has
been received in respect of the forefeited share.
Accounting for Share Capital
In case, however, if the premium amount has not been received, either wholly
or partially, in respect of the shares forfeited, the Share Premium Account will
also be debited with the amount of premium not received along-with the Share
Capital Account at the time forfeiture. This will usually be the case when even
the amount due on allotment has not been received. Thus, the journal entry to
record the forfeiture of shares issued at a premium on which premium has not
been fully received, will be :
Share Capital A/c
Securities Premium A/c
To Share Forfeiture A/c
To Share Allotment A/c
and/or
To Share Calls A/c (individually)
(..... shares forefeited for non-payment of

Note:
Where Calls-in-Arrears Account is maintained, Calls-in-Arrears Account is credited
and not Share Allotment and/or Share Call/Calls Accounts.

Accounting for Share Capital
1.7.1 Re-issue of Forfeited Shares
The directors can either cancel or re-issue the forefeited shares. In most cases,
however, they reissue special shares which may be at par, at premium or at a
discount. Normally, the forfeited shares are reissued as fully paid and at a
discount. In this context, it may be noted that the amount of discount allowed
cannot exceed the amount that had been received on forfeited shares on their
original issue, and that the discount allowed on reissue of forfeited shares should
be debited to the ‘Share Forfeited Account’. The balance, if any, left in the Share-
Forfeited Account, should be treated as capital profit and transferred to Capital
Reserve Account. For example, when a company forfeits 200 shares of Rs. 10
each on which Rs. 600 had been received, it can allow a maximum discount of
Rs. 600 on their reissue. Assuming that the company reissues these shares for
Rs. 1,800 as fully paid, the necessary journal entry will be:
Bank A/c
1,800
Share Forfeiture A/c
To Share Capital A/c
2,000
(Reissue of 200 forfeited shares at Rs. 9 per
share as fully paid)
This shall leave a balance of Rs. 400 in share forfeited account which should
be transferred to Capital Reserve Account by recording the following journal
entry:
Forfeited Share A/c
To Capital Reserve
(Profit on reissue of forfeited shares
transferred)
Another important point to be noted in this context is that the capital profit
arises only in respect of the forefited share reissued, and not on all forefeited
shares. Hence, when a part of the forfeited shares are reissued, the whole balance
of Share Forfeited Account cannot be transferred to the capital reserve. In such
a situation, it is only the proportionate amount of balance that relates to the
forefeited shares reissued which should that relates to the forefeited shares
reissued which should be transferred to capital reserve, ensuring that the
remaining balance in Share forefeited Account is equal to the amount forefeited
on shares not yet reissued.

Summary
Company: An organisation consisting of individuals called ‘shareholders’ by virtue
of their holding the shares of a company, who can act as one legal person as
regards its business through an elected board of directors.
Share: Fractional part of the capital, and forms the basis of ownership in a company;
shares are generally of two types, viz. equity shares and preference shares,
according to the provisions of The Companies Act, 1956. Preference shares again
are of different types based on varying shades of rights attached to them.
Share Capital of a company is collected by issuing shares to either a select
group of persons through the route of private placements and/or offered to the
public for subscription. Thus, the issue of shares is basic to the capital of a company.
Shares are issued either for cash or for consideration other than cash, the former
being more common. Shares are said to be issued for consideration other than
cash when a company purchases business, or some asset/assets, and the vendors
have agreed to receive payment in the form of fully paid shares of a company.
Stages of Share Issue: The issue of shares for cash is required to be made in strict
conformity with the procedure laid down by law for the same. When shares are
issued for cash, the amount on them can be collected at one or more of the following
stages:
Application for shares
Allotment of shares
(iii)
Call/Calls on shares.
Calls in arrears: Sometimes, the full amount called on allotment and/or call (calls)
is not received from the allottees/shareholders. The amount not so received are
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
cumulatively called ‘Unpaid calls’ or ‘Calls-in-Arrears’. However, it is not mandatory
for a company to maintain a separate Calls-in-Arrears Account. There are also
instances where some shareholders consider it descreet to pay a part or whole of
the amount not yet called-up on the shares allotted to them. Any amount paid by
a shareholder in the excess of the amount due from him on allotment/call (calls) is
known as ‘Calls-in-Advance’ for which a separate account is maintained. A company
has the power to charge interest on calls-in-arrears and is under an obligation to
pay interest on calls-in-advance if it accepts them in accordance with the provisions
of Articles of Association.
Oversubscription: It is possible for the shares of some companies to be
oversubscribed which means that applications for more shares are received than
the number offered for subscription through the prospectus. Under such a condition,
the alternatives available to the directors are as follows :
They can accept some applications in full and totally reject the others,
A pro-rata distribution can be made by them,
(iii)
A combination of the above two alternatives can be adopted by them.
If the amount of minimum subscription is not received to the extent of 90%, the
issue devolves. In case the applications received are less than the number of shares
offered to the public, the issue is termed as ‘under subscribed’.
Issue of Shares at Premium: Irrespective of the fact that shares have been issued for
consideration other than cash, they can be issued either at par or at premium.
The issue of shares at par implies that the shares have been issued for an amount
exactly equal to their face or nominal value. In case shares are issued  at a premium,
i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares, the amount of
premium is credited to a separate account called ‘Securities Premium Account’,
the use of which is strictly regulated by law.
Issue of Shares at Discount: Shares can as well be issued at a discount, i.e. on an
amount less than the nominal or par value of shares provided the company fully
complies with the provisions laid down by law with regard to the same. Apart from
such compliance, shares of a company cannot ordinarily be issued at a discount.
When shares are issued at a discount, the amount of discount is debited to ‘Discount
on Issue of Share Account’, which is in the nature of capital loss for the company.
Forfeiture of Shares: Sometimes, shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments
on shares allotted to them. In such a case, the company has the authority to forfeit
shares of the defaulters. This is called ‘Forfeiture of Shares’. Forfeiture means the
cancellation of allotment due to breach of contract and to treat the amount already
received on such shares as forfeited to the company. The precise accounting
treatment of share forfeiture depends upon the conditions on which the shares
have been issued — at par, premium or discount. Generally speaking, accounting
treatment on forfeiture is to reverse the entries passed till the stage of forfeiture,
the amount already received on the shares being credited to Forfeited Shares
Account.
Re-issue of Shares: The management of a company is vested with the power to
Accounting for Share Capital
reissue the shares once forfeited by it, subject of course, to the terms and conditions
in the articles of association relating to the same. The shares can be reissued even
at a discount provided the amount of discount allowed does not exceed the credit
balance of forfeited shares’ account relating to shares being reissued. Therefore,
discount allowed on the reissue of forfeited shares is debited to forfeited shares’
account.
Once all the forfeited shares have been reissued, any credit balance on forfeited
shares’ account is transferred to Capital Reserve representing profit on forfeiture
of shares. In the event of all forfeited share not being reissued, the credit amount
on forfeited shares’ account relating to shares yet to be reissued is carried forward
and the remaining balance on the account only is credited to capital reserve
account.

company raises its capital by means of issue of
shares. But the funds raised by the issue of
shares are seldom adequate to meet their long-term
financial needs of a company. Hence, most
companies turn to raising long-term funds also
through debentures which are issued either through
the route of private placement or by offering the same
to the public. The finances raised through
debentures are also known as long-term debt.  This
chapter deals with the accounting treatment of issue
and redemption of debentures and other related
aspects.
SECTION  I
Meaning of Debentures
Debenture: The word ‘debenture’ has been derived
from a Latin word ‘debere’ which means to borrow.
Debenture is a written instrument acknowledging a
debt under the common seal of the company.  It
contains a contract for repayment of principal after
a specified period or at intervals or at the option of
the company and for payment of interest at a fixed
rate payable usually either half-yearly or yearly on
fixed dates. According, to section 2(12) of The
Companies Act,1956 ‘Debenture’ includes
Debenture Stock, Bonds and any other securities of
a company whether constituting a charge on the
assets of the company or not.
E. Thomas : “A debenture is a document under
company’s seal which provides for the repayment

of a principal sum and interest thereon at regular intervals which is usually
secured by a fixed or floating charge on the company’s property and which
acknowledges loan of a company”.
Topham: “Debenture is a document given by a company as evidence of debt
to the holder usually arising out of a loan and most commonly secured by a
charge.”
Chitty J.: “Debenture’ means a document which either creates a debt or
acknowledges it and any document which fulfills either of these conditions.”
Bond:  Bond is also an instrument of acknowledgement of debt. Traditionally,
the Government issued bonds, but these days’ bonds are also being issued by
semi-government and non-governmental organisations. The terms ‘debentures’
and ‘Bonds’ are now being used inter-changeably.
Distinction between Shares and Debentures
Ownership: A shareholder is an owner of the company whereas a debenture
holder is only a loan creditor.  A share is a part of the owned capital whereas a
debenture is a part of borrowed capital.
Return:   The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on
debentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to
year depending upon the profits of the company but the rate of interest on
debentures is pre-fixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation out profits,
whereas the payment of interest is a charge on profits and is to be paid even if
there is no profit.
Repayment:  Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of
the company, while the debentures are issued for a specified period and the
amount of debentures is returned after that period. However, an amendment in
1998 to The Companies Act, 1956 has permitted the companies to buy back its
own shares from the market, particularly, when the price of its share in the
market is lower than the book value.
Voting Rights:  Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do
not normally enjoy any voting right.
Issue on Discount: Both shares and debentures can be issued at a discount.
However, shares can be issued at discount in accordance with the provisions of
Section 79 of The Companies Act, 1956 which stipulates that the rate of discount
must not exceed 10% of the face value.
Security :  Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are
generally secured and carry a fixed or floating charge over the assets of the
company.
Convertibility:  Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures
Issue and Redemption of Debentures
can be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case
these are known as convertible debentures.
Types of Debentures
A company may issue different kinds of debentures which can be classified as
under:
2.3.1 From the Point of view of Security
Secured Debentures: Secured debentures refer to those debentures
where a charge is created on the assets of the company for the purpose
of payment in case of default. The charge may be fixed or floating.  A
fixed charge is created on a specific asset whereas a floating charge is
on the general assets of the company. The fixed charge is created
against those assets which are held by a company for use in operations
not meant for sale whereas floating charge involves all assets excluding
those assigned to the secured creditors.
Unsecured Debentures: Unsecured debentures do not have a specific
a charge on the assets of the company. However, a floating charge may
be created on these debentures by default. Normally, these kinds of
debentures are not issued.
2.3.2 From the Point of view of Tenure
Redeemable Debentures: Redeemable debentures are those which are
payable on the expiry of the specific period either in lump sum or in
Instalments during the life time of the company.  Debentures can be
redeemed either at par or at premium.
Irredeemable Debentures: Irredeemable debentures are also known
as Perpetual Debentures because the company does not given any
undertaking for the repayment of money borrowed by issuing such
debentures.  These debentures are repayable on the on winding-up of
a company or on the expiry of a long period.
2.3.3 From the Point of view of Convertibility
Convertible Debentures: Debentures which are convertible into equity
shares or in any other security either at the option of the company or
the debentureholders are called convertible debentures. These
debentures are either fully convertible or partly convertible.
Non-Convertible Debentures : The debentures which cannot be
converted into shares or in any other securities are called non-
convertible debentures. Most debentures issued by companies fell in
this category.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
2.3.4 From Coupon Rate Point of view
Specific Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures are issued with a specified
rate of interest, which is called the coupon rate. The specified rate may either be
fixed or floating. The floating interest rate is usually tagged with the bank rate.
Zero Coupon Rate Debentures: These debentures do not carry a specific rate of
interest. In order to compensate the investors, such debentures are issued at
substantial discount and the difference between the nominal value and the issue
price is treated as the amount of interest related to the duration of the debentures.
2.3.5 From the view Point of Registration
Registered Debentures: Registered debentures are those debentures
in respect of which all details including names, addresses and
particulars of holding of the debentureholders are entered in a register
kept by the company. Such debentures can be transferred only by
executing a regular transfer deed.
Bearer Debentures: Bearer debentures are the debentures which can
be transferred by way of delivery and the company does not keep any
record of the debentureholders.  Interest on debentures is paid to a
person who produces the interest coupon attached to such debentures.

Issue of Debentures
The procedure for the issue of debentures is the same as that for the issue of
shares. The intending investors apply for debentures on the basis of the
prospectus issued by the company. The company may either ask for the entire
amount to be paid on application or by means of instalments on application, on
allotment and on various calls. Debentures can be issued at par, at a premium
Issue and Redemption of Debentures
or at a discount. They can also be issued for consideration other than cash or as
a Collateral Security.
2.4.1 Issue of Debentures for Cash
Debentures are said to be issued at par when their issue price is equal to the
face value. The journal entries recorded for such issue are as under.

2.4.2 Issue of Debentures at a Discount
When a debenture is issued at a price below its nominal value, it is said to be
issued at a discount. For example, the issue of Rs.100 debentures at Rs.95,
Rs.5 being the amount of discount. Discount on issue of debentures is a capital
loss and is shown on the asset side of the balance sheet under the head
“Miscellaneous Expenditure” till it is written-off. The discount on issue of
debentures can be written-off either by debiting it to profit and loss account or
out of the capital profits, if any, during the life time of debentures.
Issue and Redemption of Debentures
The Companies Act, 1956 does not impose any restrictions upon the issue
of debentures at a discount. However, convertible debentures cannot be issued
at a discount, if they are to be converted immediately.

Issue and Redemption of Debentures
Over Subscription
When the number of debentures applied for is more than the number of
debentures offered to the public, the issue is said to be over subscribed. A
company, however, cannot allot more debentures than it has invited for
subscription. The excess money received on over subscription may, however, be
retained for adjustment towards allotment and the respective calls to be made.
But the money received from applicants to whom no debentures have been
allotted, will be refunded to them.

Issue of Debentures as a Collateral Security
A collateral security may be defined as a subsidiary or secondary or additional
security besides the primary security when a company obtains a loan or overdraft
from a bank or any other financial Institution. It may pledge or mortgage some
assets as a secured loan against the said loan.  But the lending institutions may
insist on some more assets as collateral security so that the amount of loan can
be realised in full with the help of collateral security in case the amount from the
sale of principal security should fall short of the loan money.  In such a situation,
the company may issue its own debentures to the lenders in addition to some
other assets already pledged.  Such an issue of debenture is known as
‘Debentures issued as Collateral Security’.
If the company fails to repay the loan along with interest, the sender is free to
receive his money from the sale of primary security and if the realisable value of
the primary security falls short to cover the entire amount, the lender has the
right to invoke the benefit of collateral security whereby debentures may either
be presented for redemption or sold in the open market.
Debentures issued as collateral security can be dealt with in two ways in the
books of the company:
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
First Method
No entry is made in the books of accounts since no liability is created by such
issue. However, on the liability side of the Balance Sheet, below the item of loan,
a note to the effect that it has been secured by issue of debentures as a collateral
security is appended. For example, X Company has issued 9%, 10,000
debentures of Rs.100 each for a loan of Rs.10, 00,000 taken from a bank.  This
fact may be shown in the balance sheet as under:

Secured Loans:
Bank loan
10,00,000
(secured by 9%, 10,000
Debentures of Rs. 10 each

(No entry is made for issuing debentures as a Collateral Security)
Second Method
The issue of debentures as a collateral security may be recorded by means of
journal entry as follows:
Journal Entries

bank loan of Rs.10,00,000.

Terms of Issue of Debentures
When a company issues debentures, it usually mentions the terms on which
they will be redeemed at their maturity. Redemption of debentures means
discharge of liability on account of debentures by repayment made to the
debentureholders. Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at a premium.
Depending upon the terms and conditions of issue and redemption of
debentures, the following six situations are commonly found in practice.

Notes:
1. When debentures are redeemable at a premium, a provision has to be made
right at the time of the issue by debiting the amount to ‘Loss on Issue of
Debentures A/c’. It may be noted that when debentures are issued at a
discount and are redeemable at a premium, the amount of discount issue is
also debited to ‘Loss on Issue of Debentures’. It may be noted that when the
debentures are issued at a discount and are redeemable at par, the amount
debited to ‘Discount on Issue of Debentures A/c’ as usual.
2. Premium on redemption is a liability of a company payable in future. It is a
provision and is shown under the head ‘Secured Loans’ until debentures are
redeemed.
3. Loss on issue of debenture account is a capital loss and it is to be written-off
gradually against the profit and loss account or securities premium account.
The unwritten-off amount is shown on the assets side of the balance sheet
under the head ‘Miscellaneous Expenditure’. Just like discount on issue of
debenture account.

10% debentures, etc., and interest payable is calculated at the nominal value of
debentures.
Interest on debenture is a charge against the profit of the company and
must be paid whether the company has earned any profit or not. According to
Income Tax Act 1961, a company must deduct income tax at a prescribed rate
from the interest payable on debentures if it exceeds the prescribed limit. It is
called Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and is to be deposited with the tax
authorities. Of course, the debentureholders can adjust this amount against
the tax due from them.

2.10 Writing off Discount/Loss on Issue of Debentures
The discount/loss on issue of debentures is a capital loss or a fictitious asset
and, therefore, must be written-off during the life time of debentures. The amount
of discount/loss on issue of debentures should normally not be written-off in
the year of issue itself since the benefit of the debentures would accrue to the
company till their redemption. The discount/loss on it is, therefore, treated as
capital loss and, normally, spread user the duration of debentures say 5-7 years
meanwhile it should be shown under the head ‘Miscellaneous Expenditure’ on
the asset side of Balance Sheet. Section 78 of The Companies Act, 1956 also
permits the utilisation of ‘Securities Premium Account’ and other capital profits
for writing off the discount/loss on issue of debentures. In case, however, there
are no capital profits or if the capital profits are not adequate, the amount of
Issue and Redemption of Debentures
such discount/loss can be written-off against the revenue profits every year by
passing the following journal entry.
Profit and Loss A/c
To Discount/Loss on Issue of
Debentures A/c
(Discount/loss on issue of debentures
written-off)
There are two methods, which can be adopted to write off discount/loss on
issue of debentures against the revenue profits. These are as follows.
Fixed Instalment Method: When the debentures are redeemed at the
end of a specified period, the total amount of discount should be written-
off in equal instalments of fixed amount over that period. For example,
if the debentures are to be redeemed after 10 years then out of the
total amount of discount of Rs.1,00,000, Rs.10,000 will be written-off
every year.
Fluctuating Instalment Method: When debentures are repaid by
annual drawings or in instalments, the discount should be written-off
in the ratio of debentures outstanding as at the end of each accounting
year. The amount of discount, under this method, goes on reducing
every year and so this method may also be known as Reducing
Instalment Method.
For example, a company issues Rs.15,00,000, 9% Debentures at a discount
of 10% redeemable by annual drawings of Rs.3,00,000 at the end of each year.
The amount of discount to be written-off will be calculated as under:
Amount utilised during the Year
Ratio
First Year
Rs.15,00,000
Second Year
Rs.12,00,000
Third Year
Rs.  9,00,000
Fourth Year
Rs.  6,00,000
Fifth Year
Rs.  3,00,000
Hence, the amount of discount to be written-off every year will be as under :
First Year
Rs.1,50,000      5/15
=      Rs.50,000
Second Year
Rs.1,50,000      4/15
=      Rs.40,000
Third Year
Rs.1,50,000      3/15
=      Rs.30,000
Fourth Year
Rs.1,50,000      2/15
=      Rs.20,000
Fifth Year
Rs.1,50,000      1/15
=      Rs.10,000

SECTION  II
2.11 Redemption of Debentures
Redemption of debentures refers to extinguishing or discharging the liability on
account of debentures in accordance with the terms of issue. In other words
redemption of debentures means repayment of the amount of debentures by
the company. There are four ways by which the debentures can be redeemed.
These are :
Payment in lump sum
Payment in instalments
Purchase in the open market
By conversion into shares or new debentures.
Methods of Redemption of Debentures
Payment in
Payment in
Purchase in
Conversion  into Shares
Lump sum
Installments
Open Market
or New Debentures
Payment in lump sum :  The company redeems the debentures by paying the
whole amount in one lump sum to the debenturesholders at the expiry of the
agreed time or earlier at the option of the company. In this case, the time of
repayment is known in advance and the company can plan its financial resources
accordingly.
Payment in instalments :  Under this method, redemption of debentures is
made in instalments at the end of each year during the tenure of the debentures.
The total amount of debenture liability is divided by the number of years it is to
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
last and the actual debentures redeemable are identified by means of drawing
the requisite number of lots from out of the debentures outstanding for payment.
Purchase in open market:  When a  company purchases its own debentures
through stock exchanges for the purposes of cancellation, such an act of
purchasing and cancelling the debentures constitutes redemption of debentures
by purchase in the open market.
Conversion into shares or new debentures : A company can redeem its
debentures by converting them into new class of debentures or shares. If
debentureholders find that the offer is beneficial to them, they can exercise their
right of converting their debentures into new class of debentures or shares.  These
new shares or debentures can be issued at par, at a discount or at a premium.
It should be noted that only the actual proceeds of debentures are to be taken
into account for ascertaining the number of shares to be issued in lieu of the
debentures to be converted.  If debentures are originally issued at discount, the
actual amount realised from them at the time of issue is used as the basis for
computing the actual number of shares to be issued. It may be noted that this
method is applicable only to convertible debentures. Non-convertible debentures
can be redeemed in this way.
2.12 Redemption by Payment in Lump Sum
When the company pays the whole amount in one lumpsum, the following,
journal entries are recorded in the books of the company.

As per the latest provisions of The Companies Act, the company must sets
aside a portion of profits every year and transfer it to Debenture Redemption
Reserve for redemption of debentures until the debentures are redeemed. The
journal entry recorded for the purpose is as follows :
Provisions of The Companies (Amendment) Act, 2000 - Section 117C
Where a company issued debentures after the commencement of this
Act, it shall create a Debenture Redemption Reserve for the redemption
of such debentures, to which adequate amount shall be credited, from
out of its profit every year until such debentures are redeemed.
The amount credited to the Debenture Redemption Reserve shall not
be utilised by the company except for the purpose of redemption of
debentures.
SEBI’s Guidelines
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has provided some guidelines
for redemption of debentures. The focal points of these guidelines are:
Every company shall create Debenture Redemption Reserve in case of
issue of debenture redeemable after a period of more than 18 months
from the date of issue.
The creation of Debenture Redemption Reserve is obligatory only for
non-convertible debentures and non-convertible portion of partly
convertible debentures.
A company shall create Debenture Redemption Reserve equivalent to
at least 50% of the amount of debenture issue before starting the
redemption of  debenture.
Withdrawal from Debenture Redemption Reserve is permissible only
after 10% of the debenture liability has already been reduced by the
company.
SEBI guidelines would not apply under the following situations:
Infrastructure company (a company wholly engaged in the business
of developing, maintaining and operating infrastructure facilities), and
Issue and Redemption of Debentures
A company issuing debentures with a maturity period of not more
than 18 months.
2.12.1
Clarifications regarding creation of Debenture Redemption
Reserve
The Department of Company Affairs, Government of India, vide their circular
No.9/2002, dated 18.04.2002 has issued the following clarifications regarding
creation of Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR)-
No DRR is required for debentures issued by All India Financial
Institutions, regulated by RBI and Banking Companies for both public
as well as privately placed debentures.
No DRR is required in case of privately placed debentures.
Section 117C will apply to debentures issued and pending to be
redeemed and, therefore, DRR will also be created for debentures issued
prior to 13.12.2000 and pending redemption.
Section 117C will apply to non-convertible portion of debentures
issued whether they are fully or partly paid.
The Debenture Redemption Reserve account appears on the liability side of the
Balance sheet under the head “Reserves and Surpluses.” When the debentures
are redeemed, the requisite amount of Debenture Redemption Reserve is
transferred to General  Reserve by recording the following journal entry.

2.13 Redemption by Purchase in Open Market
When a company purchases its own debentures in the open market for the
purpose of immediate cancellation, the purchase and cancellation of such
debentures are termed as redemption by purchase in the open market. The
advantage of such an option is that a company can redeem the debentures at its
convenience whenever it has surplus funds. Secondly, the company can purchase
them when they are available in market at a discount.
When the debentures are purchased from the market at a discount and
cancelled, the journal entries are recorded as follows :
On purchase of our debentures for immediate cancellation
Debentures A/c
To Bank A/c
To Profit on Redemption of Debentures A/c
On transfer of Profit on Redemption
Profit on Redemption of Debenture A/c
To Capital Reserve
In case, the debentures are purchased from the market at a price which is above
the nominal value of debenture, the excess will be debited to loss on redemption
of debentures. The journal entry in that case will be

2.14 Redemption by Conversion
As stated earlier the debentures can also be debentures redeemed by converting
them into shares or new debentures.  If debentureholders find that the offer is
beneficial to them, they will take advantage of this offer.  The new shares or
debentures may be issued at par, at a discount or at a premium. It may be
noted that no Debenture Redemption Reserve is required in case of convertible
debentures because no funds are required for redemption.
Illustration 29
Arjun Plastics Limited redeemed 1,000, 15% debentures of Rs.100 each by
converting them into equity shares of Rs.10 each at a premium of Rs.2.50 per

2.15 Sinking Fund Method
Sufficient funds are required to redeem debentures at the end of a specified
period. To meet this requirement, the company may decide to create a sinking
fund and invest adequate amount in marketable securities or bonds of other
business entities. Normally, a company ensures that an equal amount is set
aside every year to arrange the necessary funds at the time of redemption.  This
is called Sinking Fund method according to while the company makes necessary
arrangements is sets aside a part of divisible profit every year and invest the
same outside the business in marketable securities. An appropriate amount is
calculated by referring to on Sinking Fund Table depending upon the rate of
return on investments and the number of years for which investments are made.
The amount thus ascertained is transferred from profits every year to Debenture
Redemption Fund and its investment is termed as Debenture Redemption Fund
Investment. This investment earns as certain amount of income (call it interest)
which is reinvested together with the fixed appropriated amount for the purpose
in subsequent years. In last year, the interest earned and the appropriated fixed
amount are not invested. In fact, at this stage the Debenture Redemption Fund
Investments are encashed and the amount so obtained is used for the redemption
of debentures. Any profit or loss made on the encashment of Debenture
Redemption Fund investments is also transferred to Debenture Redemption
Fund Account. The creation of Debenture Redemption Fund Account serves
the purpose of Debenture Redemption Reserve as required by law and the SEBI
guidelines, and is, after redemption is transferred to general reserve.
Thus, the steps involved in the working of Sinking Fund method are :
Calculate the amount of profit to be set-aside annually with the help
of sinking fund table.
Set aside the amount of profit at the end of each year and credit to
Debenture Redemption Fund (DRF) Account.
Issue and Redemption of Debentures
Purchase the investments of the equivalent amount at the end of first
year and debit it Debenture Redemption Fund Investment (DRFI)
Account.
Receive interest on investment at the end of each subsequent year.
Purchase the investments equivalent to the fixed amount of profit set
aside and the interest earned every year except last year (year of
redemption).
Receive interest on investment for the last year.
Set aside the fixed amount of profit for the last year.
Encash the investments at the end of the year of redemption.
Transfer the profit/loss on sale of investments reflected in the balance
of Debenture Redemption Fund Investment Account to Debenture
Redemption Fund Account.
Make payment to debenture holders.
Transfer Debenture Redemption Fund A/c balance to General Reserve.
The sinking fund method is used for redemption of debentures by payment in
lump sum on naturily, and the journal passed from year to year are as follows.

Summary
Debenture:Debenture is the acknowledgements of debt. It is a loan capital raised by the
company from general public. A person/holder of such a written acknowledgement is called
‘debenture holder’.
Bond: Bond is similar to debenture in terms of contents and texture. The only difference is
with respect of issue condition, i.e bonds can be issued without predetermined rate of
interest as is in case of deep discount bonds.
Charge: Charge is an incumbrance to meet the obligation under trust deed under which
company agrees to mortgage specific portion either by way of first or second charge. First
charge implies the priority in repayment of loan. Those who hold first charge against any
specific assets will realise their claim from the net realisable value of such assets. Any
amount of surplus from assets given under first charge will be utilised for setting the
claims for second chargeholder.
Types of Debenture: Debentures are of various types such as: secured and unsecured
debentures redeemable and perpetual debentures, convertible and non-convertible
debentures, zero coupon rate and specific rate, registered and bearer debentures.
Issue of Debenture: Debenture are said to be issued at par when the amount to be collected
on them is equal to their nominal or face value. If the issue price is more than nominal or
face value, it is said to be issued at a premium. If the issue price is less than the nominal
or face value, it is said to be issued on discount. The amount received as premium is
credited to ‘securities premium account’ whereas amount of discount allowed is debited to
“loss/discount on issue” and is written-off over the years.
Issue of Debenture other than Cash: Sometimes debenture can be issued to vendor or suppliers
of patents, copyrights and for transfer of intellectual property rights on preferential basis
without receiving money in cash.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Purchase Consideration: Purchase consideration is amount paid by purchasing company in
consideration for purchase of assets/business firm, another enterprise/vendor.
Collateral Security: Any security in addition to primary security is called ‘collateral security’.
Redemption of Debenture: Means discharge of liability on account of debenture/bond by
repayment made to debenture holders. Normally, the redemption takes place on the expiry
of period for which they have been issued, depending upon the terms and conditions of
issue.

aving understood how a company raises its
capital, we have to learn the nature, objectives
and types of financial statements it has to prepare
including their contents, format, uses and
limitations. The financial statements are the end
products of accounting process. They are prepared
following the consistent accounting concepts,
principles, procedures and also the legal
environment in which the business organisations
operate. These statements are the outcome of the
summarising process of accounting and are,
therefore, the sources of information on the basis of
which conclusions are drawn about the profitability
and the financial position of a company. Hence, they
need to be arranged in a proper form with suitable
contents so that the shareholders and other users
of financial statements can easily understand and
use them in their economic decisions in a meaningful
Meaning of Financial Statements
Financial statements are the basic and formal annual
reports through which the corporate management
communicates financial information to its owners
and various other external parties which include–
investors, tax authorities, government, employees,
etc. These normally refer to (a) the balance sheet
(position statement) as at the end of accounting
period, and (b) the profit and loss account (income
statement) of a company. Now a days, the cash flow
statement is also taken as an integral component of
the financial statements of a company.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

content of balance sheet
of a company;
• Explain the significance
and limitations of

Financial Statements of a Company
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Box 1
In the words of John N. Myer, “The Financial statements provide a summary of
accounts of a business enterprise, the balance sheet reflecting the assets, liabilities
and capital as on a certain date and the income statement showing the results of
operations during a certain period”.
Smith and Asburne define financial statements as “the end product of financial
accounting in a set of financial statements prepared by the accounts of a business
enterprise that purport to reveal the financial position of the enterprise, the result of
its recent activities and an analysis of what has been done with earnings”.
In the words of Anthony, “Financial statements, essentially, are interim reports
presented annually and reflect a division of the life of an enterprise into more or less
arbitrary accounting period more frequently a year”.
Nature of Financial Statements
The chronologically recorded facts about events expressed in monetary terms
for a defined period of time are the basis for the preparation of periodical financial
statements which reveal the financial position as on a date and the financial
results obtained during a period. The American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants states the nature of financial statements as, “the statements
prepared for the purpose of presenting a periodical review of report on progress
by the management and deal with the status of investment in the business and
the results achieved during the period under review. They reflect a combination
of recorded facts, accounting principles and personal judgements.”
The following points explain the nature of financial statements:
Recorded facts: Financial statements are prepared on the basis of
facts in the form of cost data recorded in accounting books. The original
cost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The figures
of various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, bills receivable,
sundry debtors, fixed assets, etc. are taken as per the figures recorded
in the accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and
at different prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are
not based on market prices, the financial statements do not show
current financial condition of the concern.
Accounting Conventions: Certain accounting conventions are followed
while preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing
inventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The
valuing of assets at cost less depreciation principle for balance sheet
purposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealing
with small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items
are treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased
even though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost
Financial Statements of a Company
and not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The
use of accounting conventions makes financial statements comparable,
simple and realistic.
Postulates: Financial statements are prepared on certain basic
assumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going
concern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation
postulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is
treated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the
assets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement
postulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in
different periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power
of money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at the
amount paid for them. While, preparing profit and loss account the
revenue is included in the sales of the year in which the sale was
undertaken even though the sale price may be received over a number
of years. The assumption is known as realisation postulate.
Personal Judgments: Under more than one circumstance, facts and
figures presented through financial statements are based on personal
opinion, estimates and judgments. The depreciation is provided taking
into consideration the useful economic life of fixed assets. Provisions
for doubtful debts are made on estimates and personal judgments. In
valuing inventory, cost or market value, whichever is less is being
followed. While deciding either cost of inventory or market value of
inventory many personal judgments are to be made based on certain
considerations. Personal opinion, judgments and estimates are made
while preparing the financial statements to avoid any possibility of
over statement of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure,
keeping in mind the convention of conservatism.
Thus, financial statements are the summarised reports of recorded facts and
are prepared following the accounting concepts, conventions and requirements
of Law.
Objectives of Financial Statements
Financial statements are the basic sources of information to the shareholders
and other external parties for understanding the profitability and financial
position of any concern. They provide information about the results of the concern
during a specified period of time and status of the concern in terms of assets
and liabilities, which provide the basis for taking decisions. Thus, the primary
objective of financial statements is to assist the users in their decision-making.
The specific objectives include the following:
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
To provide information about economic resources and obligations of
a business: They are prepared to provide adequate, reliable and
periodical information about economic resources and obligations of a
business firm to investors and other external parties who have limited
authority, ability or resources to obtain information.
To provide information about the earning capacity of the business:
They are to provide useful financial information which can gainfully
be utilised to predict, compare, and evaluate the business firm’s earning
capacity.
To provide information about cash flows: They are to provide
information useful to investors and creditors for predicting, comparing
and evaluating, potential cash flows in terms of amount, timing and
related uncertainties.
To judge effectiveness of management: They supply information
useful for judging management’s ability to utilise the resources of a
business effectively.
Information about activities of business affecting the society: They
have to report the activities of the business organisation affecting the
society, which can be determined and described or measured and which
are important in its social environment.
Disclosing accounting policies: These reports have to provide the
significant policies, concepts followed in the process of accounting and
changes taken up in them during the year to understand these
statements in a better way.
Types of Financial Statements
The financial statements generally include two statements known as balance
sheet and profit and loss account which are required for external reporting and
also for internal needs of the management like planning, decision-making and
control. These two basic statements are supported by number schedules,
annexures, supplementing the data contained in the balance sheet and profit
and loss account. Apart from these two basic financial statements, there is a
need to know about movements of funds and changes in the financial position
of the company. For this purpose, a statement of changes in financial position of
the company or a cash flow statement help in this direction.
Balance Sheet : The purpose of balance sheet is to show its resources and
obligations for acquiring its resources i.e., assets and liabilities. According to
American Institute of Public Accountants, balance sheet is “a tabular statement
of summary of balances (debits and credits) carried forward after an actual and
constructive closing of books of accounts and kept according to principles of
Financial Statements of a Company
accounting”. Balance sheet is the statement prepared on a particular date and
shows classified properties and assets on the right hand side and obligations or
liabilities on the left hand side.
Profit and Loss Account or Income Statement : The profit and loss account
is the accounting report which summarises the revenues and expenses and
ascertains the profit/loss for a specified accounting period. It also represents
the changes in the owner’s equity between two successive periods. It is an essential
statement for preparation of balance sheet and hence annexed to it. Income
statement is the moving picture of an organisation and reflects the results of
operations for a period. Income statement gives a quantitative interpretation of
policies, expenses, knowledge, foresight and aggressiveness of the management
of a business from the point of view of income, expenses, gross profit, operating
profit and net profit or loss.
As per the accounting concept of income, income (profit) is excess of realised
revenues over related expired cost of the period and loss is known as excess of
expired cost of a period over related realised revenues of the period. Thus, profit
or loss is the difference between the realised revenues of the period and the
related expired costs. It may be noted that normally accrual basis of accounting
is followed for measuring the revenues and expenses for the period. In addition,
another statement called Profit and Loss Appropriation Account is prepared to
record various appropriations of profits like transfer to reserve and provision for
dividends.

requirements as to the profit and loss account and clearly states that it “shall be
made out as clearly to disclose the result the working of the company during
the period covered by the account, and shall disclose every material feature.”
Form and Contents of Balance Sheet

the right hand side and capital and liabilities on the left.  In case of companies,
the assets and liabilities are arranged on permanency basis. Accordingly, all
permanent long term assets, and capital and liabilities are shown at the beginning
and liquid assets and liabilities are shown subsequently in order of their liquidity
or maturity. The registered companies are required to follow Part I of Schedule
VI of The Companies Act for recording assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

respective legislations. The prescribed form of balance sheet as per Part I of
Financial Statements of a Company
Schedule VI of The Companies Act has been duly given in Appendix I of this
chapter for perusal and clarily.

Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Some Peculiar Items
There are certain items relating to financial statements of companies which need
clarification to ensure their correct treatment while preparing the final accounts
of a company. Some of these have already been clarified in the previous chapters
which include items like share capital, discount on issue of shares, securities
premium, calls in arears, calls in advance, forefeited shares, discount (or loss)
on issue of debentures, etc. The nature and treatment of some other peculiar
items is explained hereunder.
Preliminary expenses: This refers to the expenses that are incurred in
connection with the formation of a company which include items like
cost of printing various documents, fees paid to the lawyers for draftingof
such documents, stamp duty, registration and filing fees paid at the time
of registration of the company, etc. The amount spent on these items is
put under one head called ‘preliminary expenses’ which is written-off
over a period of 3 to 5 years. The amount to be written-off annually is
debited to the profit and loss account, and the balance is shown under
the heading ‘Miscellaneous expenditure’ on the assets side of the balance
sheet.
Expenses on Issue of Shares and Debentures: When shares and
debentures are issued to the public, the company has to incur expenses
on preparation and printing of prospectus, advertisement on the issue,
merchant bankers fees, brokerage, etc. Such expenses are also capitalised
and written-off over a period of 3 to 5 years, and treated in the same
manner as preliminary expenses, but are shown separately.
Interest on Debentures: The rate of interest payable on debentures is
always mentioned with the debentrures, and paid half yearly on
September 30 and March 31 (or June 30 and December 31). The amount
of interest paid on debentures is given in the trial balance which is usually
for the half year. This implies that a provision must be made for the
remaining half year whether or not it is specified in adjustments. In other
words, one has to ensure that full years interest on debentures is charged
to profit and loss account and the unpaid part, if any, must be shown as
outstanding interest in the balance sheet on the liabilities side.
Provision for Taxation: This refers to the provision for income tax
(corporation tax) chargeable on profits, and it is made by debiting the
profit and loss account and crediting the provision for taxation account
which is shown on the liabilities side under the heading ‘Current liabilities
and Provisions’ in the balance sheet.
Dividends: Dividend refers to that part of profits which is distributed
among its shareholders. The general practice is to declare the dividend
for an accounting year at the annual general meeting of the company
while presenting the Annual Report (including Financial Statements) for
approval, and it is shown as proposed dividend in the appropriation
part of the profit and loss account (debit side) and so also in the balance
sheet on the liabilitieis side under the heading ‘Current Liabilities and
Financial Statements of a Company
Provisions’. Sometimes, the companies also declare and pay some
dividend during the course of an accounting year in anticipation of profits.
This is known as interim dividend and since the same stands paid, it is
simply shown in the appropriation part of the Profit and Loss Account
(debit side). In such a situation, the dividend declared in addition to the
interim dividend at the time of presenting the Annual Report is termed
as final dividend which is treated in the same manner in accounts as the
proposed dividend. It may be noted that no dividend is payable on the
calls-in-arears.
Any amount of dividend, interim or final, which remains unclaimed
(unpaid) is shown as unclaimed dividend under the heading current
liabilities.
In this context, there is another important aspect to be kept in view
namely, ‘Dividend Tax’ payable by the company. While dividends are tax
free in the hands of shareholders, the company has to pay tax on dividends
declared at the prescribed rate which is termed as ‘Corporate Dividend
Tax’ and a provision has to be made thereof. The is shown along with
dividends in the appropriation part of the profit and loss account on the
debit side, and so also in balance sheet under current liabilities and
provisions.
Transfer to Reserves:  Invariably, the companies transfer a part of their
profits to reserves. The amount transferred to general reserve or any
specific reserve is shown in the appropriation part of the profit and loss
account and added to the concerned reserve shown under the heading
‘Reserves and Surplus’ in the balance sheet.

Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Uses and Importance of Financial Statements
The users of financial statements include management, investors, shareholders,
creditors, government, bankers, employees and public at large. Financial
statements, provide the necessary information about the performance of the
management to these parties interested in the organisation and help in taking
appropriate economic decisions. It may be noted that the financial statements
constitute an integral part of the Annual Reports of the companies which is
included to are concerned which include in addition, the directors report,
auditors report, corporate governance report, and management discussion and
analysis.
The various uses and importance of financial statements are as follows:
Report on stewardship function: Financial statements report the
performance of the management to the shareholders. The gaps between
the management performance and ownership expectations can be
understood with the help of financial statements.
Basis for fiscal policies: The fiscal policies, particularly taxation policies
of the government, are related with the financial performance of
corporate undertakings. The financial statements provide basic input
for industrial, taxation and other economic policies of the government.
Basis for granting of credit: Corporate undertakings have to borrow
funds from banks and other financial institutions for different purposes.
Credit granting institutions take decisions based on the financial
performance of the undertakings. Thus, financial statements form the
basis for granting of credit.
Basis for prospective investors: The investors include both short-term
and long-term investors. Their prime considerations in their investment
decisions are security and liquidity of their investment with reasonable
profitability. Financial statements help the investors to assess long-
term and short-term solvency as well as the profitability of the concern.
Guide to the value of the investment Already Made: Shareholders of
companies are interested in knowing the status, safety and return on
their investment. They may also need information to take decision
about continuation or discontinuation of their investment in the
business. Financial statements provide information to the shareholders
in taking such important decisions.
Aids trade associations in helping their members: Trade associations
may analyse the financial statements for the purpose of providing
service and protection to their members. They may develop standard
ratios and design uniform system of accounts.
Financial Statements of a Company
Helps stock exchanges: Financial statements help the stock exchanges
to understand the extent of transparency in reporting on financial
performance and enables them to call for required information to protect
the interest of investors. The financial statements enable the stock
brokers to judge the financial position of different concerns and take
decisions about the prices to be quoted.
Limitations of Financial Statements
Though utmost care is taken in the preparation of the financial statements and
provide detailed information to the users, they suffer from the following
limitations:
Do not reflect current situation: Financial statements are prepared on
the basis of historical cost. Since the purchasing power of money is
changing, the values of assets and liabilities shown in financial
statement do not reflect current market situation.
Assets may not realise: Accounting is done on the basis of certain
conventions. Some of the assets may not realise the stated values, if
the liquidation is forced on the company. Assets shown in the balance
sheet reflect merely unexpired or unamortised cost.
Bias: Financial statements are the outcome of recorded facts,
accounting concepts and conventions used and personal judgments
made in different situations by the accountants. Hence, bias may be
observed in the results, and the financial position depicted in financial
statements may not be realistic.
Aggregate information: Financial statements show aggregate
information but not detailed information. Hence, they may not help
the users in decision-making much.
Vital Information missing: Balance sheet does not disclose information
relating to loss of markets, and cessation of agreements, which have
vital bearing on the enterprise.
No Qualitative information: Financial statements contain only
monetary information but not qualitative information like industrial
relations, industrial climate, labour relations, quality of work, etc.
They are only interim reports: Profit and loss account discloses the
profit/loss for a specified period. It does not give an idea about the
earning capacity over time similarly, the financial position reflected in
balance sheet is true at that point of time, the likely change on a future
date is not depicted.

Summary
Financial Statements: Financial statements are the end products of accounting
process, which reveal the financial results of a specified period and financial position
as on a particular date. They are the general purpose financial statements prepared
and published by every corporate undertaking for the benefit of the parties
interested. These statements include income statement and balance sheet. The
basic objective of these statements is to provide information required for decision-
making by the management as well as other outsiders who are interested in the
affairs of the undertaking.
Balance Sheet: The balance sheet shows all the assets owned by the concern, all
the obligations or liabilities payable to outsiders or creditors and claims of the
owners on a particular date. It is one of the important statements depicting the
financial position or status or strength of an undertaking. It gives a concise summary
of firm’s resources and obligations and measures the firm’s liquidity and solvency.
Balance sheet can be presented either in liquidity or permanency order. However
all companies established under The Companies Act have to prepare their financial
statements in permanency order classifying under suitable heads. Balance sheet
is prepared on the basis of accrual and going concern basis. Financial statements
are prepared for the period starting with 1st April and ending 31st March.
Income statement: The Income Statement or Profit and Loss Account is prepared for
the above period to determine the operational results of an undertaking. It is a
statement of revenue earned and the expenses incurred for earning the revenue.
It is a performance report showing the changes in income, expenses, profits and
losses as a result of business operations during the year between two balance
sheet dates.
Significance of Financial Statements: The users of financial statements include
Shareholders, Investors, Creditors, Lenders, Customers, Management, Government,
etc. Financial statements help all the users in their decision-making process. They
provide data about general purpose needs of these members.
Financial Statements of a Company
Limitations of Financial Statements: Financial statements are not free from limitations.
They provide only aggregate information to satisfy the general purpose needs of
the users but not for the specific purpose needs. They are technical statements
understood by only persons having some accounting knowledge. They reflect
historical information but not current situation, which is essential in any decision
making. In addition, one can get idea about the organisation’s performance in
terms of quantitative changes but not in qualitative terms like labour relations,
quality of work, employees satisfaction, etc. the financial statements are neither
complete nor accurate as the flow of income and expenses are segregated using
best judgment apart from accepted concepts. Hence, these statements need proper
analysis before their use in decision-making.

ou have learnt about the  financial statements
(Income Statement and Balance Sheet) of
companies. Basically, these are summarised
financial reports which provide the operating results
and financial position of companies, and the detailed
information contained therein is useful for assessing
the operational efficiency and financial soundness
of a company. This requires proper analysis and
interpretation of such information for which a
number of techniques (tools) have been developed
by financial experts. In this chapter we will have an
overview of these techniques.
4.1  Meaning of Analysis of Financial Statements
The process of critical evaluation of the financial
information contained in the financial statements in
order to understand and make decisions regarding
the operations of the firm is called ‘Financial
Statement Analysis’. It is basically a study of
relationship among various financial facts and
figures as given in a set of financial statements, and
the interpretation thereof to gain an insight into the
profitability and operational efficiency of the firm to
assess its financial health and future prospects.
The term ‘financial analysis’ includes both
‘analysis and interpretation’. The term analysis
means simplification of financial data by methodical
classification given in the financial statements.
Interpretation means explaining the meaning and
significance of the data. These two are
complimentary to each other. Analysis is useless
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter,
you will be able to :
• explain the nature and
significance of financial
analysis;
• identify the objectives of
financial analysis;
• describe the various tools
of financial analysis;
• state the limitations of
financial analysis;
• prepare comparative and
commonsize statements
and interpret the data
given therein; and
• calculate the trend
percentages and interpret
them.
Analysis of Financial Statements
without interpretation, and interpretation without analysis is difficult or even
impossible.
Financial statement analysis is very aptly defined by Bernstein as, “a judgemental
process which aims to estimate current and past financial positions and the
results of the operation of an enterprise, with primary objective of determining
the best possible estimates and predictions about the future conditions.” It
essentially involves regrouping and analysis of information provided by financial
statements to establish relationships and throw light on the points of strengths
and weaknesses of a business enterprise, which can be useful in decision-making
involving comparison with other firms (cross sectional analysis) and with firms’
own performance, over a time period (time series analysis).
Significance of Financial Analysis
Financial analysis is the process of identifying the financial strengths and
weaknesses of the firm by properly establishing relationships between the various
items of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account. Financial analysis
can be undertaken by management of the firm, or by parties outside the firm,
viz. owners, trade creditors, lenders, investors, labour unions, analysts and
others. The nature of analysis will differ depending on the purpose of the analyst.
A technique frequently used by an analyst need not necessarily serve the purpose
of other analysts because of the difference in the interests of the analysts.
Financial analysis is useful and significant to different users in the following
ways:
Finance manager: Financial analysis focusses on the facts and
relationships related to managerial performance, corporate efficiency,
financial strengths and weaknesses and creditworthiness of the company.
A finance manager must be well-equipped with the different tools of
analysis to make rational decisions for the firm. The tools for analysis
help in studying accounting data so as to determine the continuity of the
operating policies, investment value of the business, credit ratings and
testing the efficiency of operations. The techniques are equally important
in the area of financial control, enabling the finance manager to make
constant reviews of the actual financial operations of the firm to analyse
the causes of major deviations, which may help in corrective action
wherever indicated.
Top management: The importance of financial analysis is not limited to
the finance manager alone. Its scope of importance is quite broad which
includes top management in general and the other functional managers.
Analysis of Financial Statements
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Management of the firm would be interested in every aspect of the financial
analysis. It is their overall responsibility to see that the resources of the
firm are used most efficiently, and that the firm’s financial condition is
sound. Financial analysis helps the management in measuring the
success or otherwise of the company’s operations, appraising the
individual’s performance and evaluating the system of internal control.
Trade creditors: A trade creditor, through an analysis of financial
statements, appraises not only the urgent ability of the company to meet
its obligations, but also judges the probability of its continued ability to
meet all its financial obligations in future. Trade creditors are particularly
interested in the firm’s ability to meet their claims over a very short period
of time. Their analysis will, therefore, confine to the evaluation of the
firm’s liquidity position.
Lenders: Suppliers of long-term debt are concerned with the firm’s long-
term solvency and survival. They analyse the firm’s profitability overtime,
its ability to generate cash to be able to pay interest and repay the principal
and the relationship between various sources of funds (capital structure
relationships). Long-term tenders do analyse the historical financial
statements. But they place more emphasis on the firm’s projected financial
statements to make analysis about its future solvency and profitability.
Investors: Investors, who have invested their money in the firm’s shares,
are interested about the firm’s earnings. As such, they concentrate on
the analysis of the firm’s present and future profitability. They are also
interested in the firm’s capital structure to ascertain its influences on
firm’s earning and risk. They also evaluate the efficiency of the
management and determine whether a change is needed or not. However,
in some large companies, the shareholders’ interest is limited to decide
whether to buy, sell or hold the shares.
Labour unions: Labour unions analyse the financial statements to assess
whether it can presently afford a wage increase and whether it can absorb
a wage increase through increased productivity or by raising the prices.
Others: The economists, researchers, etc. analyse the financial statements
to study the present business and economic conditions. The government
agencies need it for price regulations, taxation and other similar purposes.
Objectives of Financial Analysis
Analysis of financial statements reveals important facts concerning managerial
performance and the efficiency of the firm. Broadly speaking, the objectives of
the analysis are to apprehend the information contained in financial statements
Analysis of Financial Statements
with a view to know the weaknesses and strengths of the firm and to make a
forecast about the future prospects of the firm thereby, enabling the analysts to
take decisions regarding the operation of, and further investment in, the firm.
To be more specific, the analysis is undertaken to serve the following purposes
(objectives):
to assess the current profitability and operational efficiency of the firm
as a whole as well as its different departments so as to judge the financial
health of the firm.
to ascertain the relative importance of different components of the
financial position of the firm.
to identify the reasons for change in the profitability/financial position
of the firm.
to judge the ability of the firm to repay its debt and assessing the
short-term as well as the long-term liquidity position of the firm.
Through the analysis of financial statements of various firms, an economist can
judge the extent of concentration of economic power and pitfalls in the financial
policies pursued. The analysis also provides the basis for many governmental
actions relating to licensing, controls, fixing of prices, ceiling on profits, dividend
freeze, tax subsidy and other concessions to the corporate sector.
It also helps the management in self-appraisal and the shareholders (owners)
and others to judge the performance of the management.
Tools of Financial Analysis
The most commonly used techniques of financial analysis are as follows:
Comparative Statements: These are the statements showing the
profitability and financial position of a firm for different periods of time in
a comparative form to give an idea about the position of two or more periods.
It usually applies to the two important financial statements, namely,
Balance Sheet and Income Statement prepared in a comparative form.
The financial data will be comparative only when same accounting principles
are used in preparing these statements. If this is not the case, the deviation
in the use of accounting principles should be mentioned as a footnote.
Comparative figures indicate the trend and direction of financial position
and operating results. This analysis is also known as ‘horizontal analysis’.
Common Size Statements: These are the statements which indicate the
relationship of different items of a financial statement with some common
item by expressing each item as a percentage of the common item. The
percentage thus calculated can be easily compared with the results
corresponding percentages of the previous year or of some other firms, as
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
the numbers are brought to common base. Such statements also allow an
analyst to compare the operating and financing characteristics of two
companies of different sizes in the same industry. Thus, common-size
statements are useful, both, in intra-firm comparisons over different years
and also in making inter-firm comparisons for the same year or for several
years. This analysis is also known as ‘Vertical analysis’.
Trend Analysis: It is a technique of studying the operational results and
financial position over a series of years. Using the previous years’ data of a
business enterprise, trend analysis can be done to observe the percentage
changes over time in the selected data. The trend percentage is the
percentage relationship, which each item of different years bear to the
same item in the base year. Trend analysis is important because, with its
long run view, it may point to basic changes in the nature of the business.
By looking at a trend in a particular ratio, one may find whether the ratio
is falling, rising or remaining relatively constant. From this observation, a
problem is detected or the sign of good management is found.
Ratio Analysis: It describes the significant relationship which exists
between various items of a balance sheet and a profit and loss account of
a firm. As a technique of financial analysis, accounting ratios measure the
comparative significance of the individual items of the income and position
statements. It is possible to assess the profitability, solvency and efficiency
of an enterprise through the technique of ratio analysis.
Cash Flow Analysis: It refers to the analysis of actual movement of cash
into and out of an organisation. The flow of cash into the business is called
as cash inflow or positive cash flow and the flow of cash out of the firm is
called as cash outflow or a negative cash flow. The difference between the
inflow and outflow of cash is the net cash flow. Cash flow statement is
prepared to project the manner in which the cash has been received and
has been utilised during an accounting year as it shows the sources of
cash receipts and also the purposes for which payments are made. Thus,
it summarises the causes for the changes in cash position of a business
enterprise between dates of two balance sheets.
In this chapter, we shall have a brief idea about the first three techniques,
viz. comparative statements common size statements and trend analysis. The
ratio analysis and cash flow analysis is covered in detail in chapters 5 and 6
respectively.

Comparative Statements
As stated earlier, these statements refer to the Profit and Loss Account and
Balance Sheet prepared by providing columns for the figures for both the current
year as well as for the previous year and for the changes during the year, both in
absolute and relative terms. As a result, it is possible to find out not only the
balances of account as on different dates and summaries of different operational
activities of different periods, but also the extent of their increase or decrease
between these dates. The figures in the comparative statements can be used for
identifying the direction of changes and also the trends in different indicators of
performance of an organisation.
The following steps may be followed to prepare the comparative statements:
Step 1 : List out absolute figures in rupees relating to two points of time (as
shown in columns 2 and 3 of Figure 4.1.).
Step 2 : Find out change in absolute figures by subtracting the first year (Col.2)
from the second year (Col.3) and indicate the change as increase (+) or decrease
(–) and put it in column 4.
Step 3 : Preferably, also calculate the percentage change as follows and put it
in Column 5.

Analysis of Financial Statements
Interpretation
The comparative balance sheet of the company reveals that during the year
2006, there has been an increase in fixed assets by Rs.1,10,000, i.e. 13.5%
while long-term liabilities have relatively increased by Rs.1,50,000 and equity
share capital has increased by Rs.2 lakhs. This fact depicts that the policy of
the company is to purchase fixed assets from long-term source of finance, thereby
not affecting the working capital.
The current assets have increased by Rs.1,52,000, i.e. 24.52%. The current
liabilities have increased only by Rs.20,000, i.e. 12.9%. This shows an
improvement in the liquid position of the Company.
Shareholder’s funds (share capital plus reserves) have shown an increase of Rs.
92,000.
The overall financial position of the company is satisfactory.

Common Size Statement
Common Size Statement, also known as component percentage statement, is a
financial tool for studying the key changes and trends in the financial position
and operational result of a company. Here, each item in the statement is stated
as a percentage of the aggregate, of which that item is a part. For example, a
common size balance sheet shows the percentage of each asset to the total assets,
and that of each liability to the total liabilities. Similarly, in the common size
income statement, the items of expenditure are shown as a percentage of the net
sales. If such a statement is prepared for successive periods, it shows the changes
Analysis of Financial Statements
of the respective percentages over time. [See the Five year Review of Asian paints
(India) Ltd. Exhibit 2].
Common size analysis is of immense use for comparing enterprises which
differ substantially in size as it provides an insight into the structure of financial
statements.  Inter-firm comparison or comparison of the company’s position
with the related industry as a whole is possible with the help of common size
statement analysis.
The following procedure may be adopted for preparing the common size
statements.
List out absolute figures in rupees at two points of time, say year 1,
and year 2 (Column 2 & 4 of Exhibit 2)
Choose a common base (as 100). For example, Sales revenue total
may be taken as base (100) in case of income statement, and total
assets or total liabilities (100) in case of balance sheet.
For all items of Col. 2 and 4 work out the percentage of that total.
Column 3 and 5 portray these percentages in Figures 4.2.

Interpretation :
In 2005, both current assets and current liabilities decreased as compared to
2004, but the decrease in current assets is more than the decrease in the current
liabilities. As a result, the firm may face liquidity problem.
In 2005 both fixed assets and the long-term liabilities increased, but the increase
in the fixed assets is more than the increase in long-term liabilities. The firm sold
some investments to acquire fixed assets and used short-term funds to purchase
fixed assets.
The firm has undertaken expansion programme reflected in addition to land and
buildings.
The overall financial position of the firm is satisfactory. It should improve its liquidity.

Trend Analysis
The financial statements may be analysed by computing trends of series of
information. Trend analysis determines the direction upwards or downwards
and involves the computation of the percentage relationship that each item bears
to the same item in the base year. In case of comparative statement, an item is
compared with itself in the previous year to know whether it has increased or
decreased or remained constant. Common size is observed to know whether the
proportion of an item (say cost of goods sold) is increasing or decreasing in the
common base (say sales). But in case of trend analysis, we learn about the
behaviour of the same item over a given period, say, during the last 5 years.
Take for example, administrative expenses, whether they are exhibiting
increasing tendency or decreasing tendency or remaining constant over the period
of comparison, generally trend analysis is done for a reasonably long period.
Many companies present their financial data for a period of 5 or 10 years in
various forms in their annual reports.
Analysis of Financial Statements
4.7.1
Procedure for Calculating Trend Percentage
One year is taken as the base year. Generally, the first year is taken as the base
year. The figure of base year is taken as 100. The trend percentages are calculated
in relation to this base year. If a figure in other year is less than the figure in base
year, the trend percentage will be less than 100 and it will be more than 100 if
figure is more than the base year figure. Each year’s figure is divided by the
base year figure.
Present year value
Trend Percentage = ____________________________________   100
Base year value
The accounting procedures and conventions used for collecting data and
preparation of financial statements should be similar; otherwise the figures will
not be comparable.

Interpretation :
The sales have continuously increased in all the years up to 2005, though in
different proportions. The percentage in 2005 is 200 as compared to 100 in
2001. The increase in sales is quite satisfactory.
The figures of stock have also increased over a period of five years. The increase
in stock is more in 2004 and 2005 as compared to earlier years.
Profit has substantially increased. The profits have increased in greater
proportion than sales which implies that the company has been able to reduce
their cost of goods sold and control the operating expenses.

in the business in the form of reserves, and the share capital has also increased,
may be due to issue of fresh shares or bonus shares.
The increase in current liabilities is more than that of long term debt. This may
be due to expansion of business and/or availability of greater credit activities.

inancial statements aim at providing financial
information about a business enterprise to meet
the information needs of the decision-makers.
Financial statements prepared by a business
enterprise in the corporate sector are published and
are available to the decision-makers. These
statements provide financial data which require
analysis, comparison and interpretation for taking
decision by the external as well as internal users of
accounting information. The act is termed as
financial statement analysis. It is regarded as  an
integral and important part of accounting. As
indicated in the previous chapter, the most
commonly used techniques of financial statement,
analysis are comparative statements, common size
statements, trend analysis, accounting ratios and
cash flow analysis. The first three have been
discussed in detail in the previous chapter. This
chapter covers the technique of accounting ratios
for analysing the information contained in financial
statements for assessing the solvency, efficiency and
profitability of the firms.
Meaning of Accounting Ratios
As stated earlier, accounting ratios are an important
tool of financial statement analysis. A ratio is a
mathematical number calculated as a reference to
relationship of two or more numbers and can be
expressed as a fraction, proportion, percentage, and
a number of times. When the number is calculated
by referring to two accounting numbers derived from
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter,

using accounting ratios;
⑨Identify the various
types of ratios
commonly used ;
⑨Calculate various ratios
to assess solvency,
liquidity, efficiency and
profitability of the firm;
⑨Interpret the various
ratios calculated for
intra-firm and inter-
firm comparisons.
Accounting Ratios
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
the financial statements, it is termed as accounting ratio. For example if the
gross profit of the business is Rs. 10,000 and the sales are Rs. 1,00,000, it can
be said that the gross profit is 10% (10,000/1,00,000) of the sales. This ratio is
termed as gross profit ratio. Similarly, inventory turnover ratio may be 6 which
implies that inventory turns into sales six times in a year.
It needs to be observed that accounting ratios exhibit relationship, if any
between accounting numbers extracted from financial statements, they are
essentially derived numbers and their efficacy depends a great deal upon the
basic numbers from which they are calculated. Hence, if the financial statements
contain some errors, the derived numbers in terms of ratio analysis would also
present an erroneous scenerio. Further, a ratio must be calculated using
numbers which are meaningfully correlated. A ratio calculated by using two
unrelated numbers would hardly serve any purpose. For example, the furniture
of the business is Rs. 1,00,000 and Purchases are Rs. 3,00,000. The ratio of
purchases to furniture is 3 (3,00,000/1,00,000) but it hardly has any relevance.
The reason is that there is no relationship between these two aspects.
Objectives of Ratio Analysis
Ratio analysis is indispensable part of interpretation of results revealed by the
financial statements. It provides users with crucial financial information and
points out the areas which require investigation. Ratio analysis is a technique.
Which involves regrouping of data by application of arithmetical relationships,
though its interpretation is a complex matter. It requires a fine understanding
of the way and the rules used for preparing financial statements. Once done
effectively, it provides a wealth of information which helps the analyst:
To know the areas of the business which need more attention;
To know about the potential areas which can be improved with the
effort in the desired direction;
To provide a deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency
and efficiency levels in the business;
To provide information for making cross sectional analysis by
comparing the performance with the best industry standards;
To provide information derived from financial statements useful for
making projections and estimates for the future.
Advantages of Ratio Analysis
The ratio analysis if properly done improves the user’s understanding of the
efficiency with which the business is being conducted. The numerical
relationships throw light on many latent aspects of the business. If properly
analysed, the ratios make us understand various problem areas as well as the
bright spots of the business. The knowledge of problem areas help management
Accounting Ratios
take care of them in future. The knowledge of areas which are working better
helps you improve the situation further. It must be emphasised that ratios are
means to an end rather than the end in themselves. Their role is essentially
indicative and that of a whistle blower. There are many advantages derived from
the ratio analysis. These are summarised as follows:
Helps understand efficacy of decisions: The ratio analysis helps you
understand whether the business firm has taken the right kind of
operating, investing and financing decisions. It indicates how far they
have helped in improving the performance.
Simplify complex figures and establish relationships: Ratios help in
simplifying the complex accounting figures and bring out their
relationships. They help summarise the financial information effectively
and assess the managerial efficiency, firm’s credit worthiness, earning
capacity, etc.
Helpful in comparative analysis: The ratios are not be calculated for
one year only. When many year figures are kept side by side, they help
a great deal in exploring the trends visible in the business. The
knowledge of trend helps in making projections about the business
which is a very useful feature.
Identification of problem areas: Ratios help business in identifying
the problem areas as well as the bright areas of the business. Problem
areas would need more attention and bright areas will need polishing
to have still better results.
Enables SWOT analysis: Ratios help a great deal in explaining the
changes occurring in the business. The information of change helps
the management a great deal in understanding the current threats
and opportunities and allows business to do its own SWOT (Strength-
Weakness-Opportunity-Threat) analysis.
Various comparisons: Ratios help comparisons with certain bench
marks to assess as to whether firm, performance is better or otherwise.
For this purpose, the profitability, liquidity, solvency, etc. of a business
may be compared: (i) over a number of accounting periods with itself
(Intra-firm Comparison/Time Series Analysis), (ii) with other business
enterprises (Inter-firm Comparison/Cross-sectional Analysis), and
(iii)with standards set for that firm/industry (comparison with standard
(or industry) expectations).
Limitations of Ratio Analysis
Since the ratios are derived from the financial statements, any weakness in the
original financial statements will also creep in the derived analysis in the form of
ratio analysis. Thus, the limitations of financial statements also form the
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
limitations of the ratio analysis. Hence, to interpret the ratios, the user should
be aware of the rules followed in the preparation of financial statements and
also their nature and limitations. The limitations of ratio analysis which arise
primarily from the nature of financial statements are as under:
Limitations of Accounting Data: Accounting data give an unwar-ranted
impression of precision and finality. In fact, accounting data “reflect a
combination of recorded facts, accounting conventions and personal
judgements and the judgements and conventions applied affect them
materially. For example, profit of the business is not a precise and
final figure. It is merely an opinion of the accountant based on
application of accounting policies. The soundness of the judgement
necessarily depends on the competence and integrity of those who
make them and on their adherence to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles and Conventions”. Thus, the financial statements may not
reveal the true state of affairs and so the ratios will also not give the
true picture.
Ignores Price-level Changes: The financial accounting is based on
stable money measurement principle. It implicitly assumes that price
level changes are either non-existent or minimal. But the truth is
otherwise. We are normally living in inflationary economies where the
power of money declines constantly. A change in the price level makes
analysis of financial statement of different accounting years meaningless
because accounting records ignore changes in value of money.
Ignore Qualitative or Non-monetary Aspects: Accounting provides
information about quantitative (or monetary) aspects of business.
Hence, the ratios also reflect only the monetary aspects, ignoring
completely the non-monetary (qualitative) factors.
Variations in Accounting Practices: There are differing accounting
policies for valuation of stock, calculation of depreciation, treatment of
intangibles, definition of certain financial variables, etc. available for
various aspects of business transactions. These variations leave a big
question mark on the cross sectional analysis. As there are variations
in accounting practices followed by different business enterprises, a
valid comparison of their financial statements is not possible.
Forecasting: Forecasting of future trends based only on historical
analysis is not feasible. Proper forecasting requires consideration of
non-financial factors as well.
Now let us talk about the limitations of the ratios. The various limitations
Means and not the End: Ratios are means to an end rather than the
end by itself.
Accounting Ratios
Lack of ability to resolve problems: Their role is essentially indicative
and of whistle blowing and not providing a solution to the problem.
Lack of standardised definitions: There is a lack of standardised
definitions of various concepts used in ratio analysis. For example,
there is no standard definition of liquid liabilities. Normally, it includes
all current liabilities, but sometimes it refers to current liabilities less
bank overdraft.
Lack of universally accepted standard levels: There is no universal
yardstick which specifies the level of ideal ratios. There is no standard
list of the levels universally acceptable, and, in India, the industry
averages are also not available.
Ratios based on unrelated figures: A ratio calculated for unrelated
figures would essentially be a meaningless exercise. For example,
creditors of Rs. 1,00,000 and furniture of Rs. 1,00,000 represent a
ratio of 1:1. But it has no relevance to assess efficiency or solvency.
Hence, ratios should be used with due consciousness of their limitations
while evaluatory the performance of an organisation and planning the future
strategies for its improvement.

State which of the following statements are True or False.
The only purpose of financial reporting is to keep the managers informed
about the progress of operations.
Analyses of data provided in the financial statements as is termed as financial
analysis
Long-term creditors are concerned about the ability of a firm to discharge
its obligations to pay interest and repay the principal amount of term.
A ratio is always expressed as a quotient of one number divided by another.
Ratios help in comparisons of a firm’s results over a number of accounting
periods as well as with other business enterprises.
One ratios reflect both quantitative and qualitative aspects.
Types of Ratios
There is a two way classification of ratios: (1) traditional classification, and (2)
functional classification. The traditional classification has been on the basis of
financial statements to which the determinants of ratios belong. On this basis
the ratios are classified as follows:
Income Statement Ratios: A ratio of two variables from the income
statement is known as Income Statement Ratio. For example, ratio of
gross profit to sales known as gross profit ratio is calculated using
both figures from the income statement.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Balance Sheet Ratios: In case both variables are from balance sheet,
it is classified as Balance Sheet Ratios. For example, ratio of current
assets to current liabilities known as current ratio is calculated using
both figures from balance sheet.
Composite Ratios: If a ratio is computed with one variable from income
statement and another variable from balance sheet, it is called Composite
Ratio. For example, ratio of credit sales to debtors and bills receivable
known as debtor turnover ratio is calculated using one figure from
income statement (credit sales) and another figure from balance sheet
(debtors and bills receivable).
Although accounting ratios are calculated by taking data from financial
statements but classification of ratios on the basis of financial statements is
rarely used in practice. It must be recalled that basic purpose of accounting is
to throw useful light on the financial performance (profitability) and financial
position (its capacity to raise money and invest them wisely) as well as changes
occurring in financial position (possible explanation of changes in the activity
level). As such, the alternative classification (functional classification) based on
the purpose for which a ratio is computed, is the most commonly used
classification which reach as follows:
Liquidity Ratios: To meet its commitments, business needs liquid
funds. The ability of the business to pay the amount due to
stakeholders as and when it is due is known as liquidity, and the
ratios calculated to measure it are known as ‘Liquidity Ratios’. They
are essentially short-term in nature.
Solvency Ratios: Solvency of business is determined by its ability to
meet its contractual obligations towards stakeholders, particularly
towards external stakeholders, and the ratios calculated to measure
solvency position are known as ‘Solvency Ratios’. They are essentially
long-term in nature, and
Activity (or Turnover) Ratios: This refers to the ratios that are calculated
for measuring the efficiency of operation of business based on effective
utilisation of resources. Hence, these are also known as ‘efficiency
ratios’.
Profitability Ratios: It refers to the analysis of profits in relation to
sales or funds (or assets) employed in the business and the ratios
calculated to meet this objective are known as ‘Profitability Ratios’.

Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity ratios are calculated to have indications about the short term solvency
of the business, i.e. the firm’s ability to meet its current obligations. These are
analysed by looking at the amounts of current assets and current liabilities in
the balance sheet. These include bank overdraft, creditors, outstanding capenses,
bills payable, income received inadvance. The two ratios included in this category
are Current Ratio and Liquid Ratio.
5.6.1  Current Ratio
Current ratio is the proportion of current assets to current liabilities. It is
expressed as follows:
Current Ratio  =  Current Assets : Current Liabilities or
Cu rren t Assets
Cu rren t Liabilities
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Current assets include cash in hand, bank balance, debtors, bills receivable,
stock, prepaid expenses, accrued income, and short-term investments
(marketable securities).
Current liabilities include creditors, bills payable, outstanding expenses,
provision for taxation net of advance tax, bank overdraft, short-term loans,
income received in advance, etc.

Bills Receivable
10,000
Bills Payable
40,000

Solution
Current Assets
= Rs.50,000 + Rs.40,000 + Rs.10,000 + Rs.4,000 + Rs.30,000
=  Rs.1,34,000
Current Liabilities = Rs.60,000 + Rs.40,000 + Rs.4,000 =  Rs. 1,04,000
Current Ratio
= Rs.1,34,000 : Rs.1,04,000  =  1.29 : 1.
Significance: It provides a measure of degree to which current assets cover current
liabilities. The excess of current assets over current liabilities provides a measure
of safety margin available against uncertainty in realisation of current assets
and flow of funds. The ratio should be reasonable. It should neither be very high
or very low. Both the situations have their inherent disadvantages. A very high
current ratio implies heavy investment in current assets which is not a good
sign as it reflects under utilisation or improper utilisation of resources. A low
ratio endangers the business and puts it at risk of facing a situation where it
will not be able to pay its short-term debt on time. If this problem persists, it
may affect firms credit worthiness adversely. Normally, it is advocated to have
this ratio as 2:1.
5.6.2
Quick Ratio
It is the ratio of quick (or liquid) asset to current liabilities. It is expressed as
Quick ratio = Quick Assets : Current Liabilities  or
Qu ick Assets
Cu rren t Liabilities
The quick assets are defined as those assets which are quickly convertible
into cash. While calculating quick assets we exclude the closing stock and prepaid
Accounting Ratios
expenses from the current assets. Because of exclusion of non-liquid current
asset, it is considered better than current ratio as a measure of liquidity position
of the business. It is calculated to serve as a supplementary check on liquidity
position of the business and is therefore, also known as ‘Acid-Test Ratio’.
Illustration 2
Calculate quick ratio from the information given in illustration 1.
Solution
Quick Assets
= Current Assets – Stock – Advance Tax
Quick Assets
= Rs. 1,34,000 – (Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000) = Rs. 80,000
Current Liabilities
= Rs. 1,04,000
Quick ratio
= Quick Assets : Current Liabilities
= Rs. 80,000 : Rs. 1,04,000
= 1:.77
Significance: The ratio provides a measure of the capacity of the business to
meet its short-term obligations without any flaw. Normally it is advocated to be
safe to have a ratio of 1:1 as unnecessarily low ratio will be very risky and a high
ratio suggests unnecessarily deployment of resources in otherwise less profitable
short-term investments.

The current ratio is 2:1. State giving reasons which of the following transactions
would improve, reduce and not change the current ratio:
Repayment of current liability;
Purchased goods on credit;
Sale of an office typewriter (Book value – Rs. 4,000) for Rs. 3,000 only;
Sale of merchandise (goods) costing Rs. 10,000 for Rs. 11,000;
Payment of dividend.
Solution
The change in the ratio depends upon the original ratio. Let us assume that
current assets are Rs. 50,000 and current liabilities are Rs. 25,000; and so the
current ratio is 2:1. Now we will analyse the effect of given transactions on current
ratio.
Assume that Rs. 10,000 of creditors is paid by cheque. This will reduce
the current assets to Rs. 40,000 and current liabilities to Rs. 15,000.
The new ratio will be 2.67(Rs. 40,000/Rs.15,000). Hence, it has
improved.
Assume that Rs. 10,000 goods are purchased on credit. This will
increase the current assets to Rs. 60,000 and current liabilities to
Rs. 35,000. The new ratio will be 1.71(Rs. 60,000/Rs. 35,000). Hence,
it has reduced.
Due to sale of a typewriter (a fixed asset) the current assets will increase
upto Rs. 53,000 without any change in the current liability. The new
ratio will be 2.12(Rs. 53,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has improved.
This transaction will decrease the stock by Rs. 10,000 and increase
the cash by Rs. 11,000 thereby increasing the current assets by
Rs. 1,000 without and change in the current liability. The new ratio
will be 2.04 (Rs. 51,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has improved.
Assume that Rs. 5,000 is given by way of dividend. It will reduce the
current assets to Rs. 45,000 without any change in the current liability.
The new ratio will be 1.8 (Rs. 45,000/Rs. 25,000). Hence, it has reduced.

Solvency Ratios
The persons who have advanced money to the business on long-term basis are
interested in safety of their payment of interest periodically as well as the
repayment of principal amount at the end of the loan period. Solvency ratios are
calculated to determine the ability of the business to service its debt in the long
run. The following ratios are normally computed for evaluating solvency of the
business.
Debt equity ratio;
Debt ratio;
Proprietary ratio;
Total Assets to Debt Ratio;
Interest Coverage Ratio.
5.7.1
Debt-Equity Ratio
Debt Equity Ratio measures the relationship between long-term debt and equity.
If debt component of the total long-term funds employed is small, outsiders feel
more secure. From security point of view, capital structure with less debt and
more equity is considered favourable as it reduces the chances of bankruptcy.
Normally, it is considered to be safe if debt equity ratio is 2:1. It is computed as
follows:
Debt-Equity ratio    =
Long-term Debt’s/
Long-term Debt
or     Share holders Fund
Shareholders Fund or
Where Shareholders Funds =   Equity Share Capital + Reserves and Surplus
(equity)
– Fictitious Assets + Preference Share Capital
Alternatively, it can be calculated as Non–fictitions Total
Assets – Total External Liabilities.
Long-term Funds = Debentures + Long-term Loans
Significance: This ratio measures the degree of indebtedness of an enterprise
and gives an idea to the long-term lender regarding extent of security of the
debt. As indicated earlier, a low debt equity ratio reflects more security. A high
ratio, on the other hand, is considered risky as it may put the firm into difficulty
in meeting its obligations to outsiders. However, from the perspective of the
owners, greater use of debt trading on equity may help in ensuring higher.
returns for them if the rate of earnings on capital employed is higher than the
rate of interest payable. But it is considered risky and so, with the exception of
a few business, the prescribed ratio is limited to 2:1. This, ratio is also termed as
‘Leverage Ratio’.

Total external liabilities Rs.5,00,000 Balance Sheet Total
Rs.10,10,000
Current liabilities
Rs.1,00,000 Fictitious Assets
Rs.10,000
Solution
Long-term Debt
= Total External Liabilities – Current Liabilities
= Rs. 5,00,000 – Rs. 1,00,000 = Rs. 4,00,000
Total Non-fictitious Assets
= Total Assets – Fictitious Assets
= Rs. 10,10,000 – Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 10,00,000
Shareholders Funds
= Non-fictitious Total Assets – Total liabilities
= Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 5,00,000 = Rs. 5,00,000
Debt Equity Ratio
= Rs. 4,00,000/Rs. 5,00,000  =  4:5.
5.7.2
Debt Ratio
The Debt Ratio refers to the ratio of long-term debt to the total of external and
internal funds (capital employed or net assets). It is computed as follows:
Long-term Debt/Capital Employed (or Net Assets)
Capital employed is equal to the long-term debt + shareholders’ fund.
Alternatively, it may be taken as net assets which are equal to the total non-
fictitionies assets – current liabilities taking the data of Illustration 7, capital
employed shall work out to Rs. 4,00,000 + Rs. 5,00,000 = Rs. 9,00,000. Similarly,
Net Assets as Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 1,00,000 = Rs. 9,00,000 and he Debt Ratio as
Rs. 4,00,000/Rs. 9,00,000 = 0.444.
Significance : Like debt equity ratio, it shows proportion of long-term debt in
capital employed. Low ratio provides security to creditors and high ratio helps
management in trading on equity. In the above case, the debt ratio is less than
half which indicates reasonable funding by debt and adequate security of debt.
It may be noted that Debt Ratio can also be computed in relation to total
assets. In that case, it usually refers to the ratio of total debt (long-term debt +
current liabilities) to total assets, i.e. total of fixed and current assets (or
shareholders funds + long-term debt + current liabilities), and is expressed as
Total Debt
Debt Ratio = Total Assets
5.7.3    Proprietary Ratio
Proprietary ratio expresses relationship of proprietor’s (shareholders) funds to
net assets and is calculated as follows :
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Proprietary Ratio
=  Shareholders Funds/Capital employed (or net assets)
Based on data of Illustration 7, it shall be worked out as follows:
Rs. 5,00,000/Rs. 9,00,000 = 0.556
Significance: Higher proportion of shareholders funds in financing the assets is
a positive feature as it provides security to creditors. This ratio can also be
computed in relation to total assets in lead of net assets (capital employed) It
may be noted that the total of Debt Ratio and Proprietory Ratio will be equal to
1. Take these ratio worked out on the basis of data of Illustration 7, the Debt
Ratio is 0.444 and the Proprietory Ratio 0.556, the total is 0.444 + 0.556 = 1. In
terms of percentage if can be stated that the 44% of the capital employed is
funded by debt and 56% by owners funds.

Total Assets to Debt Ratio
This ratio measures the extent of the coverage of long-term debt by assets. It is
calculated as
Total assets to Debt Ratio  =  Total assets/Long-term debt
Taking the data of Illustration on 8, this ratio will be worked out as follows:
Rs. 13,90,000/Rs. 1,50,000 = 9.27 times
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
The higher ratio indicates that asset have been mainly financed by owners
funds, and the long-term debt is adequately covered by assets.
It is better to take the net assets (capital employed) instead of total assets for
computing this ratio also. It will be observed that in that case, the ratio will be
the reciprocal of the debt ratio.
Significance. This ratio primarily indicators the rate of external funds in financing
the assets and the extent of coverage of their debt is covered by assets.

the debt equity ratio of 1:2. Now we will analyse the effect of given transactions
on debt equity ratio.
Assume that Rs. 1,00,000 worth of equity shares are issued. This will
increase the internal funds to Rs. 11,00,000. The new ratio will be
5:11(5,00,000/11,00,000). Thus, it is clear that further issue of equity
shares decreases the debt-equity ratio.
Cash received from debtors will leave the internal and external funds
unchanged as this will only affect the current assets. Hence the debt-
equity ratio will remain.
This will also leave the ratio unchanged.
Assume that Rs. 1,00,000 debentures are redeemed. This will decrease
the long-term debt to Rs. 4,00,000. The new ratio will be 4:10(4,00,000/
10,00,000). Thus, any new issue of debenture will decrease the debt
equity ratio.
This will also leave the ratio unchanged.
5.7.5
Interest Coverage Ratio
It is a ratio which deals with the servicing of interest on loan. It is a measure of
security of interest payable on long-term debt. It expresses the relationship
between profits available for payment of interest and the amount of interest
payable. It is calculated as follows:
Interest Coverage Ratio
Net Profit before Interest and Tax/
Interest on long term debt
Significance: It reveals the number of times interest on long-term debt is covered
by the profits available for interest. A higher ratio ensures safety of interest
payment debt and it also indicates availability of surplus for shareholders.
Illustration 11
From the following details, calculate interest coverage ratio:
Net Profit after tax  Rs. 60,000; 15% Long-term Debt 10,00,000; and Tax Rate
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Solution
Net Profit after Tax
= Rs. 60,000
Tax Rate
= 40%
Net Profit before tax
= Net profit after tax*100/(100 – Tax rate)
= Rs. 60,000*100/(100 – 40)
= Rs. 1,00,000
Interest on Long Term Debt
= 15% of Rs. 10,00,000  =  Rs. 1,50,000
Net profit before interest and tax = Net profit before tax + Interest
= Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 1,50,000 = Rs. 2,50,000
Interest Coverage Ratio
= Net Profit before Interest and
Tax/Interest on long term debt
= Rs. 2,50,000/Rs. 1,50,000
= 1.67 times.
Activity (or Turnover) Ratios
The turnover ratios basically exhibit the activity levels characterised by the
capacity of the business to make more sales or turnover. The activity ratios
express the number of times assets employed, or, for that matter, any constituent
of assets, is turned into sales during an accounting period. Higher turnover
ratio means better utilisation of assets and signifies improved efficiency and
profitability, and as such are known as efficiency ratios. The important activity
ratios calculated under this category are :
Stock Turn-over;
Debtors (Receivable) Turnover;
Creditors (Payable) Turnover;
Investment (Net Assets) Turnover
Fixed Assets Turnover;
Working Capital Turnover.
5.8.1
Stock (or Inventory) Turnover Ratio
It determines the number of times stock is turned in sales during the accounting
period under consideration. It expresses the relationship between the cost of
goods sold and stock of goods. The formula for its calculation is as follows:
Stock Turnover Ratio  =  Cost of Goods Sold/ Average Stock
Where average stock refers to arithmetic average of opening and closing stock,
and the cost of goods sold means sales less gross profit.
Significance : It studies the frequency of conversion of stock of finished goods
into sales. It is also a measure of liquidity. It determines how many times stock
Accounting Ratios
is purchased or replaced during a year. Low turnover of stock may be due to
bad buying, obsolete stock, etc. and is a danger signal. High turnover is good
but it must be carefully interpreted as it may be due to buying in small lots or
selling quickly at low margin to realise cash. Thus, it throws light on utilisation
of stock of goods.

5.8.2
Debtors (Receivables) Turnover Ratio
It expresses the relationship between credit sales and debtors. It is calculated
as follows :
Debtors Turnover ratio
= Net Credit sales/ Average Accounts Receivable
Where Average Account Receivable
= (Opening Debtors and Bills Receivable +
Closing Debtors and Bills Receivable)/2
It needs to be noted that debtors should be taken before making any provision
for doubtful debts.
Significance: The liquidity position of the firm depends upon the speed with
which debtors are realised. This ratio indicates the number of times the
receivables are turned over and coverted into cash in an accounting period.
Higher turnover means speedy collection from debtors. This ratio also helps in
working out the average collection period, ratio calculated by dividing the days/
months in a year by debtors turnover ratio.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Illustration 15
Calculate the Debtors Turnover Ratio from the following information:
Total sales
Rs. 4,00,000

Debtors on 31.12.2004
Rs. 1,20,000
Solution
Average Debtors
= (Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 1,20,000)/2  =  Rs. 80,000
Net credit sales
= Total sales – Cash sales
= Rs.4,00,000 – Rs.80,000 (20% of Rs.4,00,000)
= Rs. 3,20,000
Debtors Turnover Ratio
= Net Credit sales/
Average Debtors
= Rs. 3,20,000/Rs. 80,000

5.8.3
Creditors (Payable) Turnover Ratio
Creditors turnover ratio indicates the pattern of payment of accounts payable.
As accounts payable arise on account of credit purchases, it expresses
relationship between credit purchases and accounts payable. It is calculated as
follows :
Creditors Turnover ratio
Net Credit purchases/
Average accounts payable
Where Average account payable
(Opening Creditors and Bills Payable +
Closing Creditors and Bills Payable)/2
Significance : It reveals average payment period. Lower ratio means credit allowed
by the supplier is for a long period or it may reflect delayed payment to suppliers
which is not a very good policy as it may affect the reputation of the business.
The average period of payment can be worked out by days/months in a year by
the turnover rate.

Net Sales/Capital Employed
Capital turnover which studies turnover of capital employed (Net Assets) is
analysed further by following two turnover ratios :
Fixed Assets Turnover : It is computed follows:
Fixed asset turnover
Net Sales/Net Fixed Assets
Working Capital Turnover : It is calculated as follows :
Working Capital Turnover
Net Sales/Working Capital
Significance : High turnover, capital employed, working capital and fixed assets
is a good sign and implies efficient utilisation of resources. Utilisation of capital
employed or, for that matter, any of its components is revealed by the turnover
ratios. Higher turnover reflects efficient utilisation resulting in higher liquidity
and profitability in the business.

5.9.1
Gross Profit Ratio
Gross profit ratio as a percentage of sales is computed to have an idea about
gross margin. It is computed as follows:
Gross Profit Ratio = Gross Profit/Net Sales × 100
Significance: It indicates gross margin or mark-up on products sold. There is
no standard norm for its comparison. It also indicates the margin available to
cover operating expenses, non-operating expenses, etc. Change in gross profit
ratio may result from change in selling price or cost of sales or a combination of
both. A low ratio may indicate unfavourable purchase and sales policy. It must
be interpreted carefully as valuation of stock also affects its computation. Higher
gross profit ratio is always a good sign.

5.9.2
Operating Ratio
It is computed to analyse cost of operation in relation to sales. It is calculated as
follows:
Operating Ratio
=  (Cost of Sales + Operating Expenses)/ Net Sales × 100
Operating expenses include office expenses, administrative expenses, selling
expenses and distribution expenses.
Cost of operation is determined by excluding non-operating incomes and
expenses such as loss on sale of assets, interest paid, dividend received, loss by
fire, speculation gain and so on.
5.9.3
Operating Profit Ratio
It is calculated to reveal operating margin. It may be computed directly or as a
residual of operating ratio.
Operating Profit Ratio
= 100 – Operating Ratio
Alternatively, it is calculated as under:
Operating Profit Ratio
=  Operating Profit/ Sales × 100
Where Operating Profit
=  Sales – Cost of Operation
Significance: Operating Ratio is computed to express cost of operations excluding
financial charges in relation to sales. A corollary of it is ‘Operating Profit Ratio’.
It helps to analyse the performance of business and throws light on the
operational efficiency of the business. It is very useful for inter-firm as well as
intra-firm comparisons. Lower operating ratio is a very healthy sign.

Net Profit Ratio is based on all inclusive concept of profit. It relates sales to net
profit after operational as well as non-operational expenses and incomes. It is
calculated as under:
Net Profit Ratio     =    Net profit / Sales × 100
Generally, net profit refers to Profit after Tax (PAT).
Significance: It is a measure of net profit margin in relation to sales. Besides
revealing profitability, it is the main variable in computation of Return on
Investment. It reflects the overall efficiency of the business, assumes great
significance from the point of view of investors.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Illustration 21
Gross profit ratio of a company was 25%. Its credit sales was Rs. 20,00,000 and
its cash sales was 10% of the total sales. If the indirect expenses of the company

Solution
Cash sales
Rs.20,00,000 × 10/90
Rs.2,22,222
Hence, total sales are
Rs.22,22,222.
Gross profit = .25 × 22,22,222

5.9.5
Return on Capital Employed or Investment (ROCE or ROI)
It explains the overall utilisation of funds by a business enterprise. Capital
employed means the long-term funds employed in the business and includes
shareholders fund, debentures and long-term loans. Alternatively, capital
employed may be taken as the total of non-factious assets current liabilities.
Profit refers to the Profit before Interest and Tax (PBIT) for computation of this
ratio. Thus, it is computed as follows:
Return on Investment (or Capital Employed) = Profit before Interest and Tax/
Capital Employed × 100
Significance: It measures return on capital employed in the business. It reveals
the efficiency of the business in utilisation of funds entrusted to it by shareholders,
debenture-holders and long-term liabilities. For inter-firm comparison, return
on capital employed which reveals overall utilisation of fund is considered good
measure of profitability. It also helps in assessing whether the firm is earning a
higher return on capital employed as compared to the interest rate paid.
5.9.6
Return on Shareholders’ Fund
This ratio is very important from shareholders’ point of view in assessing whether
their investment in the firm generates a reasonable return or not. It should be
higher than the return on investment otherwise it would imply that company’s
funds have not been employed profitably.
Accounting Ratios
A better measure of profitability from shareholders point of view is obtained
by determining return on total shareholders fund, it is also termed as Return on
Net Worth (RONW) and is calculated as under :
Return on Shareholders’ Fund =
Profit after Tax
Sh areh olders Fu n d
5.9.7
Earnings Per Share
The ratio is defined as –
=  Profit available for equity shareholders/ No. of Equity Shares
In this context, earnings refer to profit available for equity shareholders which
is worked out as Profit after Tax – Dividend on Preference Shares.
This ratio is very important from equity shareholders point of view and so
also for the share price in the stock market. This also helps comparison with
other firm’s to ascertain its reasonableness and capacity to pay dividend.
5.9.8
Book Value Per Share
This ratio is calculated as –
Book Value per share = Equity shareholders’ funds/No. of Equity Shares
Equity shareholder funds refer to Shareholders Funds – Preference Share
Capital. This ratio is again very important from equity shareholders point of
view as it gives an idea about the value of their holding and affects market price
of the shares.
5.9.9
Dividend Payout Ratio
This refers to the proportion of earning that are distributed against the
shareholders. It is calculated as –
Dividend Payout Ratio =
Dividend Per Sh are
Earn in gs Per Sh are
This reflects company’s dividend policy and growth in owner’s equity.
5.9.10 Price Earning Ratio
The ratio is defined as –
P/E Ratio =  Market price of a Share/Earnings per Share
For example, if the EPS of company X is Rs. 10 and market price is Rs. 100,
the price earning ratio will be 10 (100/10). It reflects investors expectation about
the growth in the firm’s earnings and reasonableness of the market price of its
shares. P/E ratios vary from industy to industry and company to company in
the same industry depending upon investors perception of their future.

The current ratio is 2.5:1. Current assets are Rs. 50,000 and current liabilities
are Rs. 20,000. How much must be the decline in the current assets to bring the
ratio to 2:1.
Solution
Current liabilities
= Rs. 20,000
For a ratio of 2:1, the current assets must be 2 × 20,000
= Rs. 40,000
Present level of current assets
= Rs. 50,000
Necessary decline
= Rs. 50,000 – Rs. 40,000
= Rs. 10,000.

Summary
Financial Statement Analysis: It is an integral part of the basic accounting
to provide the necessary value addition to the users.
Ratio Analysis: An important tool of financial statement analysis is ratio
analysis. Accounting ratios represent relationship between two accounting
numbers.
Objective of Ratio Analysis:The objective of ratio analysis is to provide a
deeper analysis of the profitability, liquidity, solvency and activity levels in
the business. It is also to identify the problem areas as well as the strong
areas of the business.
Advantages of Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis offers many advantages
including enabling financial statement analysis, helping understand efficacy
of decisions, simplifying complex figures and establish relationships, being
helpful in comparative analysis, identification of problem areas, enables
SWOT analysis, and allows various comparisons.
Limitations of Ratio Analysis: There are many limitations of ratio analysis.
Few are based because of the basic limitations of the accounting data on
which it is based. The other set includes the limitation of the ratio analysis
per set. In the first set are included factors like Historical Analysis, Ignores
Price-Level Changes, Ignore Qualitative or Non-Monetary Aspects,
Limitations of Accounting Data, Variations in Accounting Practices, and
Forecasting. In the second set are included factor like means and not the
end, lack of ability to resolve problems, lack of standardised definitions,
lack of universally accepted standard levels, and ratios based on unrelated
figures.
Types of Ratios: There are many types of ratios, viz. liquidity, solvency,
activity and profitability ratios. The liquidity ratios include current ratio
and acid test ratio.  Solvency ratios are calculated to determine the ability
of the business to service its debt in the long run instead of in the short
run. They include debt equity ratio, total assets to debt ratio, proprietary
ratio and times interest coverage ratio. The turnover ratios basically exhibit
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
the activity levels characterised by the capacity of the business to make
more sales or turnover and include Stock Turnover, Debtors (Receivable)
Turnover, Creditors (Payable) Turnover, Working Capital Turnover, Fixed
Assets Turnover, and Current asset Turnover. Profitability ratios are
calculated to analyse the earning capacity of the business which is the
outcome of utilisation of resources employed in the business. The ratios
include Gross Profit ratio, Operating ratio, Net-profit-ratio, Return on
investment (Capital employed), Earnings per Share, Book Value per Share,
Dividend per Share, and Price Earning ratio.
Question for Practice
Short Answer Questions
What do you mean by Ratio Analysis?
What are various types of ratios?
What relationships will be established to study:
Inventory Turnover
Debtor Turnover
Payables Turnover
Working Capital Turnover.
Why would the inventory turnover ratio be more important when analysing
a grocery store than an insurance company?
The liquidity of a business firm is measured by its  ability to satisfy its
long-term obligations as they become due ? Comment.
The average age of inventory is viewed as the average length of time
inventory is held by the firm or as the average number of day’s sales in
inventory. Explain.
Long Answer Questions
Who are the users of financial ratio analysis? Explain the significance of
ratio analysis to them?
What are liquidity ratios? Discuss the importance of current and liquid
ratio.
How would you study the Solvency position of the firm?
What are important profitability ratios? How are they worked out?
Financial ratio analysis are conduced by four groups of analysts:
managers, equity investors, long-term creditors, and short-term creditors.
What is the primary emphasis of each of these groups in evaluating ratios?
The current ratio provides a better measure of overall liquidity only when
a firm’s inventory cannot easily be converted into cash. If inventory is
liquid, the quick ratio is a preferred  measure of overall liquidity. Explain.

ill now you have learnt about the financial
statements being primarily inclusive of Position
Statement (showing the financial position of an
enterprise as on a particular date) and Income
Statement (showing the result of the operational
activities of an enterprise over a particular period).
There is also a third important financial statement
known as Cash flow statement, which shows inflows
and outflows of the cash and cash equivalents. This
statement is usually  prepared by companies which
comes as a tool in the hands of users of financial
information to know about the sources and uses of
cash and cash equivalents of an enterprise over a
period of time from various activities of an
enterprise. It has gained substantial importance in
the last decade because of its practical utility to the
users of financial information.
Accounting Standard-3 (AS-3), issued by The
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)
in june 1981, which dealt with a statement showing
‘Changes in Financial Position’, (Fund Flow
Statement), has been revised and now deals with the
preparation and presentation of Cash flow statement.
The revised AS-3 has made it mandatory for all listed
companies to prepare and present a cash flow
statement along with other financial statements on
annual basis. Hence, it may be noted, that Fund
Flow statement is no more considered relevant in
accounting and so not discussed  here.
A cash flow statement provides information
about the historical changes in cash and cash
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After studying this chapter,
you will be able to :
• State the purpose
and preparation of
statement of cash flow
statement;
• Distinguish between
operating activities,
investing activities and
financing activities;
• Prepare the statement
of cash flows using
direct method;
• Prepare the cash
flow statement using
indirect method.
Cash Flow Statement
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
equivalents of an enterprise by classifying cash flows into operating, investing
and financing activities. It requires that an enterprise should prepare a cash
flow statement and should present it for each accounting period for which financial
statements are presented.  You will recall that cash flow analysis has also been
mentioned in Chapter 4 as a technique of financial analysis. This chapter
discusses this technique and explains the method of preparing a cash from
statement for an accounting period.
Nature of Cash Flow Statement
A Cash flow statement shows inflow and outflow of cash and cash equivalents
from various activities of a company during a specific period. The primary
objective of cash flow statement is to provide useful information about cash
flows (inflows and outflows) of an enterprise during a particular period under
various heads, i.e. operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
This information is useful in providing users of financial statements with a
basis to assess the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents
and the needs of the enterprise to utilise those cash flows. The economic decisions
that are taken by users require an evaluation of the ability of an enterprise to
generate cash and cash equivalents and the timing and certainty of their
generation.
Benefits of Cash Flow Statement
Cash flow statement provides the following benefits :
 A cash flow statement when used along with other financial statements
provides information that enables users to evaluate changes in net assets
of an enterprise, its financial structure (including its liquidity and
solvency) and its ability to affect  the amounts and timings of cash
flows in order to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities.
 Cash flow information is useful in assessing the ability of the enterprise
to generate cash and cash equivalents and enables users to develop
models to assess and compare the present value of the future cash
flows of different enterprises.
 It also enhances the  comparability of the reporting of operating
performance by different enterprises because it eliminates the effects of
using different accounting treatments for the same transactions and
events.
 Historical cash flow information is often used as an indicator of the
amount, timing and certainty of future cash flows. It is also helpful in
checking the accuracy of past assessments of future cash flows and in
Cash Flow Statement
examining the relationship between profitability and net cash flow and
impact of changing prices.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
As stated earlier, cash flow statement shows inflows and outflows of cash and
cash equivalents from various activities of an enterprise during a particular
period. As per AS-3, ‘Cash’ comprises cash in hand and demand deposits with
banks, and  ‘Cash equivalents’ means short-term highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value. Thus, cash equivalents refer to such
investments that are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash
commitments rather than for investments or other purposes. An investment
normally qualifies as cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity, of say,
three months or less from the date of acquisition. Investments in shares are
excluded from cash equivalents unless they are in substantial cash equivalents.
For example, preference shares of a company acquired shortly before their specific
redemption date, provided there is only insignificant risk of failure of the company
to repay the amount at maturity. Similarly, short-term marketable securities
which can be readily converted into cash are treated as cash equivalents.
Cash Flows
‘Cash Flows’  implies movement of cash in and out of non-cash items. Receipt of
cash from a non-cash item is termed as cash inflow while cash payment in respect
of such items as cash outflow. For example, purchase of machinery by paying
cash  is cash outflow while sale proceeds received from sale of machinery is cash
inflow. Other examples of cash flows include collection of cash from debtors,
payment to creditors, payment to employees, receipt of dividend, interest
payments, etc.
As per AS 3, cash flows exclude movements between items that constitute
cash or cash equivalents because these components are part of the cash
management of an enterprise rather than part  of its operating, investing of
financing activities. Cash management includes the investment of excess cash
in cash equivalents. Hence, purchase of marketable securities or short-term
investment which constitutes cash equivalents is not considered while preparing
cash flow statement.
Classification of Activities for the Preparation of Cash Flow
Statement
You know that various activities of an enterprise result into cash flows (inflows
or receipts and outflows or payments) which is the subject matter of a cash flow
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
statement. As per AS-3, these activities are to be classified into three categories:
(1) operating, (2) investing, and (3) financing activities so as to show separately
the cash flows generated (or used) by (in) these activities. This helps the users of
cash flow statement to assess the impact of these activities on the financial position
of an enterprise and so also on its cash and cash equivalents.
6.5.1
Cash from Operating Activities
As per AS-3, operating activities are the activities that constitute the primary or
main activities of an enterprise, for example, for a company manufacturing
garments, procurement of raw material, incurrence of manufacturing expenses,
sale of garments, etc. These are the principal  revenue producing activities (or
the main activities) of the enterprise and other activities that are not investing or
financing activities. The amount of cash from operations’ indicate the internal
solvency level of the company, and is regarded as the key indicator of the extent
to which the operations of the enterprise have generated sufficient cash flows to
maintain the operating capability of the enterprise, paying dividends, making of
new investments and repaying of loans without recourse to external source of
financing. Information about the specific components of historical operating cash
flows is useful in conjunction with other information, in forecasting future
operating cash flows.
Cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from the main
activities of the enterprise. Therefore, they generally result from the transactions
and other events that enter into the determination of net profit or loss. Examples
of cash flows from operating activities are:
Cash Inflows from operating activities
 cash receipts from sale of  goods and the rendering of services.
 cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenues.
Cash Outflows from operating activities
 Cash payments to suppliers for goods and services.
 Cash payments to and on behalf of the employees.
 Cash payments to an insurance enterprise for premiums and claims,
annuities, and other policy benefits.
 Cash payments or refunds of income taxes unless they can be
specifically identified with financing and investing activities.
The net position is shown in case of operating cash flows.
Some transactions such as sale of an item of plant may give rise to a gain or
loss which is included in the determination of net profit or loss. However, the
Cash Flow Statement
cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows from investing activities
which are discussed in detail later.
An enterprise may hold securities and loans for dealing or trading purposes
in which case they are similar to inventory acquired specifically for resale.
Therefore, cash flows arising from the purchase and sale of dealing or trading
securities are classified as operating activities. Similarly, cash advances and
loans made by financial enterprises are usually classified as operating activities
since they relate to main activity of that enterprise.
6.5.2
Cash from Investing Activities
Investing activities relate to purchase and sale of long-term assets or fixed assets
such as machinery, furniture, land and building, etc. Transactions related to
long-term investment are also investing activities. As per AS-3, investing activities
are the acquisition and  disposal of long-term assets and other investments not
included in cash  equivalents.
Separate disclosure of cash flows from investing activities is important
because they represent the extent to which expenditures have been made for
resources intended to generate future income and cash flows.  Examples of cash
flows arising from investing activities are:
Cash Outflows from investing activities
 Cash payments to acquire fixed assets including intangibles and
capitalised research and development.
 Cash payments to acquire shares warrants or debt instruments of other
enterprises other than the instruments considered to be cash
equivalents or held for trading purposes.
 Cash advances and loans made to third party (other than advances
and loans made by a financial enterprise wherein it is operating
activities).
Cash Inflows from Investing Activities
 Cash receipt from disposal of  fixed assets including intangibles.
 Cash receipt from the repayment of advances or loans made to third
parties ( except in case of financial enterprise).
 Cash receipt from disposal of shares, warrants or debt instruments of
other enterprises other than receipts from those instruments considered
to be cash or cash equivalents or held for trading purposes.
 Interest received in cash from loans and advances.
 Dividend received from investments in other enterprises.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
6.5.3
Cash from Financing Activities
As the name suggests, financing activities relate to long-term funds or capital of
an enterprise, e.g. cash proceeds from issue of equity shares, debentures, raising
long-term bank loans, redemption of bank loan, etc. As per AS-3, financing
activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the
owners’ capital   (including preference share capital in case of a company) and
borrowings of the enterprise. Separate disclosure of cash flows arising from
financing activities is important because it is useful in predicting claims on future
cash flows by providers of funds ( both capital and borrowings ) to the enterprise.
Examples of financing activities are:
Cash Inflows from financing activities
 Cash proceeds from issuing shares or other similar instruments.
 Cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, bonds and other short
or long-term borrowings.
Cash Outflows from financing activities
 Cash repayments of amounts borrowed.
 Interest paid on loans, debentures and advances.
 Dividends paid on equity and preference capital.
It is important to mention here that a transaction may include cash flows
that are classified differently. For example, when the instalment paid in respect
of a fixed asset acquired on deferred payment basis includes both interest and
loan, the interest element is classified under financing activities and the loan
element is classified under investing activities. Moreover, same activity may be
classified differently for different enterprises. For example, purchase of shares is
an operating activity for a share brokerage firm while it is investing activity in
case of other enterprises.

Treatment of Some Peculiar Items
Extraordinary items
Extraordinary items are not the regular phenomenon, e.g. loss due to theft or
earthquake or flood. Extraordinary items are non-recurring in nature and hence
cash flows associated with extraordinary items should be classified and disclosed
separately as arising from operating, investing or financing activities. This is
done to enable users to understand their nature and effect on the present and
future cash flows of an enterprise.
Interest and Dividend
In case of a financial enterprise (whose main business is lending and borrowing),
interest paid,  interest received  and dividend received are classified as operating
activities while  dividend  paid is the financing activity.
In case of a non-financial enterprise, as per AS-3, it is considered more
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
appropriate that  payment of interest and dividend paid are classified as financing
activities whereas receipt of interest and dividends are classified as investing
activities.
Taxes on Income and Gains
Taxes may be income tax (tax in normal profit), capital gains tax (tax on capital
profits), dividend tax (tax on the amount distributed as dividend to share holders).
AS 3 requires that cash flows arising from taxes on income should be separately
disclosed and should be classified as cash flows from operating activities unless
they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities. This
clearly implies that:
 tax on operating profit should be classified as operating cash flows.
 dividend tax, i.e. tax paid on dividend should be classified as financing
activity along with dividend paid.
 Capital gains tax paid on sale of fixed assets should be classified under
investing activities.
Non-cash Transactions
As per AS-3, investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of
cash or cash equivalents should be excluded from a cash flow statement.
Examples of such transactions are – acquisition of machinery by issue of equity
shares, or redemption of debentures by issue of equity shares. Such transactions
should be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provide
all the relevant information about these investing and financing activities. Hence,
stocks acquired by issue of shares are not disclosed in cash flow statement.
With these three classifications, Cash Flow Statement is shown in Figure

Ascertaining Cash Flow from Operating Activities
Operating activities are the main source of revenue and expenditure in an
enterprise. Not only that, this aspect is most complex  and regarded as the major
problem area faced while preparing the cash flow statement. Therefore, the
ascertainment of cash flows from operating activities need special attention.
As per AS-3,  an enterprise should report cash flows from operating activities
using either by using :
 Direct method whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross
cash payments are disclosed;
 Indirect method whereby net profit or loss is duly adjusted for the effects
of (1) transactions of a non-cash nature, (2) any deferrals or accruals of
past/future operating cash receipts, and (3) items of income or expenses
associated with investing or financing cash flows. It is important to
mention here that under indirect method, the starting point is net profit/
loss before taxation and extra ordinary items as per Income Statement
of the enterprise. Then this amount is for non-cash items, etc. adjusted
for ascertaining cash flows from operating activities.
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
Accordingly, cash flow from operating activities can be determined using
either the Direct method or the Indirect method. These methods are discussed
in detail as follows.
6.6.1
Direct Method
As the name suggests, under direct method, major heads of cash inflows and
outflows (such as cash received from debtors, salary payments, etc) are
considered.
It is important to note here that items are recorded on accrual basis in Profit
and Loss Account. Hence, certain adjustments are made to convert them into
cash basis such as the following :
Cash receipts from customers =  Sales+ Debtors  and Bills Receivable
in the beginning – Debtors and Bills Receivable in the end.
Cash payments to suppliers  = Purchases + Creditors and Bills Payable
in the beginning – Creditors and Bills Payable in the end.
Purchases =  Cost of Goods Sold – Opening Stock + Closing Stock
Cash Expenses = Expenses on Accrual basis – Prepaid Expenses in the
beginning and Outstanding Expenses in the end +  Prepaid Expenses
in the end and Outstanding Expenses in the beginning.
However, the following items are not to be considered:
1. Non-cash items such as depreciation , discount on shares, etc. be written-
2. Items which are classified as investing or financing activities such as
interest received, dividend paid, etc.
As per AS-3, under the direct method, information about major classes of
gross cash receipts and cash payments may be obtained either–
 from the accounting records of the enterprise, or
 by adjusting sales cost of sales and other items in the statement of
profit or loss for the following:
changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables
and payables;
other non cash items; and
other items for which cash effects are investing or financing cash
flows.
Figure 6.2 shows the Proforma of cash flows from operating activities using
direct method.

Working Notes:
Cash Receipts from Customers is calculated as under :
Cash Receipts from Customers =  Sales+ Debtors and Bills Receivables in the
beginning – Debtors and Bills Receivables in the end
= Rs.2,20,000 + Rs.25,000 + Rs.8,000 – Rs.30,000 – Rs.6,000
= Rs. 2,17,000
Purchases =  Cost of Goods Sold – Opening Stock + Closing Stock
= Rs. 1,20,000 – Rs. 22,000 + Rs. 27,000
= Rs. 1,25,000
Cash Payments to Suppliers = Purchases+ Creditors and Bills Payables in the
beginning – Creditors and Bills Payable in the end
= Rs. 1,25,000 + Rs.17,000 – Rs.15,000
= Rs. 1,27,000
Cash Expenses = Expenses on Accrual basis – Prepaid Expenses in the beginning
and Outstanding Expenses in the end + Prepaid Expenses in the end and
Outstanding Expenses in the beginning
Cash Paid to Employees = Rs. 30,000+Rs.2,000 – Rs.3,000
= Rs. 29,000
Cash Paid for Insurance Premium = Rs. 8,000 – Rs.5,000+Rs.5,500
= Rs. 8,500
Income Tax Paid = Rs. 10,000+Rs.3,000 – Rs.2,000
= Rs. 11,000
It is important to note here that there are no extraordinary items.
6.6.2  Indirect Method
As mentioned earlier, indirect method of ascertaining cash flow from operating
activities begins with the amount of net profit/loss. This is not so because income
statement incorporates the effects of all operating activities of an enterprise.
However, income statement is prepared on accrual basis (and not on cash basis).
Moreover, it also includes certain non-operating items such as interest paid,
profit/loss on sale of fixed assets, etc) and non-cash items (such as depreciation,
goodwill to be written-off, etc. Therefore, it becomes necessary to adjust the
amount of net profit/loss as shown by Profit and Loss Account for arriving at
cash flows from operating activities. Let us look at the example :

Net Profit

1,02,000
1,02,000
The above Profit and Loss Account shows the amount of net profit of
Rs.32,000. This has to be adjusted for arriving cash flows from operating
activities. Let us take various items one by one.
Depreciation is a non-cash item and hence, Rs.10,000 charged as
depreciation does not result in any cash flow. Therefore, this amount
must be added back to the net profit.
Interest paid of Rs.12,000 is a cash outflow on account of financing
activity. Therefore, this amount must also be added back to net profit
while calculating cash flows from operating activities. This amount of
interest will be shown as an outflow under the head of financing
activities.
Profit on sale of land is cash inflow from investing activity. Hence, this
amount must be deducted from the amount of net profit while
calculating cash flows from operating activities.
The above example gives you an idea as to how various adjustments are
made in the amount of net profit/loss. Other important adjustments relate to
changes in working capital which are necessary (i.e. items of current assets and
current liabilities) to convert net profit/loss which is based on accrual basis into
cash flows from operating activities. Therefore, the increase in current assets
and decrease in current liabilities are added to the net profit, and the decrease
in current assets and increase in current liabilities are deducted from the net
profit so as to arrive at the exact amount of net cash flow from operating activities.
As per AS-3, under indirect method, net cash flow from operating activities is
determined by adjusting net profit or loss for the effect of :
 Non-cash items such as depreciation, goodwill be written-off, provisions,
deferred taxes, etc. which are to be added back.
 All other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash
flows. The treatment of such items depend upon their nature. All investing
and financing incomes are to be deducted from the amount of net profits
while all such expenses are to be added back. For example, interest expense
Accountancy : Company Accounts and Analysis of Financial Statements
which is a financing cash outflow is to be added back while interest income
which is investing cash inflow is to be deducted from the amount of net
profit.
 Changes in current assets and liabilities during the period. Increase in
current assets and decrease in current liabilities are to be deducted while
increase in current liabilities and decrease in current assets are to be
added up.
Figure 6.3 shows the proforma of calculating cash flows from operating
activities as per indirect method.
The direct method provides information which is useful in estimating future
cash flows. But such information is not available under the indirect method.
However, in practice, indirect method is mostly used by the companies for arriving
at the net cash flow from operating activities.

that the income tax paid is deducted there from as the last item to arrive at the

Increase in the value of debtors
Decrease in the amount of accrued income.
Sometimes, neither the amount of net profit is specified nor the Profit and Loss
Account is given. In such a situation, the amount of net profit can be worked
out by comparing the Profit, and Loss Account balance given in the comparative
Balance Sheets for two years. The difference is treated as the net profit for the
year; and, then, by adjusting it with the amount of provision for tax made during
the year (as worked out by comparing the provision for tax balances of two
years given in balance sheets), the amount of ‘Net Profit before tax’ can be
ascertained (see Illustration (see Illustration 7 and 8)
Ascertainment of Cash Flow from Investing and Financing Activities
The details of item leading inflows and outflows from investing and financing
activities have already been outlined. While preparing the cash flow statement,
all major items of gross cash receipts, gross cash payments, and net cash flows
from investing and financing activities must be shown separately under the
headings ‘Cash Flow from Investing Activities’ and ‘Cash Flow from Financing
Activities’ respectively.’
The ascertainment of net cash flows from investing and financing activities
have been briefly dealt with in Illustrations 5 and 6.

Preparation of Cash Flow Statement
As stated earlier cash flow statement provides information about change in the
position of Cash and Cash Equivalents of an enterprise, over an accounting
period. The activities contributing this change are classified into operating,
investing and financial. The methology of working out the net cash flow (or use)
from all the three activities for an accounting period has been explained in details
and a brief format of Cash Flow Statement has also been given in Fig. 6.1. However,
while preparing a cash flow statement, full details of inflows and outflows are
given under head including the net cash flow (or use) arise there from. The
aggregate of the net cash flows (or use) is worked out and is shown as, Net
Increase Decrease in cash and Cash Equivalents’ to which the amount of ‘cash
and cash equivalent at the beginning’ is added and thus the amount of ‘cash
and cash equivalents at the end’ is arrived at as shown in Fig. 6.1. This figure
will be the same as the total amount of cash in hand, cash at bank (or overdraft)
and cash equivalants (if any) given in the balance sheet (see Illustrations 7 to
10). Another point that needs to be noted is that when cash flows from operating
activities are worked out by an indirect method and shown as such in the cash
flow statement, the statement itself is termed as ‘Indirect method cash flow
statement’. Thus, the cash flow statements prepared in Illustrations 7, 8 and 9
fall under this category as the cash flows from operating activities have been
worked out by indirect method. Similarly, if the cash flows from operating
activities are worked by direct method while preparing the cash flow statement,
it will be termed as ‘direct method Cash Flow Statement’. Illustration 10 shows
both types of Cash Flow Statement. However, unless it is specified clearly as to
which method is to be used, the cash flow statement may preferably be prepared
by an indirect method as is done by most companies in practive. Look at these
flow statements of Grase in Industries, Ucal Fuel Systems and Sterlite optical
Technologies given at the end of the Chapter.
