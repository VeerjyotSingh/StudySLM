Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be
linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish
learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and
community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement
this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries
between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the
direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to
encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We
must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with
the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and
initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed
body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in
the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required
number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation
will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy
experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the
problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts
to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work
done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the
Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief
Advisor for this book, Dr H.K. Dewan for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this
possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to
draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the
National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and
Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time anc contribution. As an organisation committed to
systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments
and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Preface
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 suggests the need for developing the ability for
mathematisation in the child. It points out that the aim of learning mathematics is not merely being
able to do quantitative calculations but also to develop abilities in the child that would enable her/him
to redefine her/his relationship with the World. The NCF-2005 also lays emphasis on development in
the children logical abilities as well as abilities to comprehend space, spatial transformations and
develop the ability to visualise both these. It recommends that mathematics needs to slowly move
towards abstraction even though it starts from concrete experiences and models. The ability to
generalise and perceive patterns is an important step in being able to relate to the abstract and logic
governed nature of the subject.
We also know that most children in upper primary and secondary classes develop a fear of
mathematics and it is one of the reasons for students not being able to continue in schools.
NCF-2005 has also mentioned this problem and has therefore emphasised the need to develop a
programme which is relevant and meaningful. The need for conceptualising mathematics teaching
allows children to explore concepts as well as develop their own ways of solving problems. This also
forms corner-stone of the principles highlighted in the NCF-2005.
In Class VI we have begun the process of developing a programme which would help
children understand the abstract nature of mathematics while developing in them the ability to construct
their own concepts. As suggested by NCF-2005, an attempt has been made to allow multiple ways of
solving problems and encouraging children to develop strategies different from each other.
There is an emphasis on working with basic principles rather than on memorisation of algorithms
and short-cuts.
The Class VII textbook has continued that spirit and has attempted to use language which the
children can read and understand themselves. This reading can be in groups or individual and at some
places require help and support by the teacher. We also tried to include a variety of examples and
opportunities for children to set problems. The appearance of the book has sought to be made pleasant
by including many illustrations. The book attempts to engage the mind of the child actively and provides
opportunities to use concepts and develop her/his own structures rather than struggling with
unnecessarily complicated terms and numbers.
We hope that this book would help all children in their attempt to learn mathematics and would
build in them the ability to appreciate its power and beauty. We also hope that this would enable to
revisit and consolidate concepts and skills that they have learnt in the primary school. We hope to
strengthen the foundation of mathematics, on which further engagement with studies as well as her
daily life would become possible in an enriched manner.
The team in developing the textbook consists of many teachers who are experienced and brought
to the team the view point of the child and the school. We also had people who have done research in
learning of mathematics and those who have been writing textbooks for mathematics for many years.
The team has tried to make an effort to remove fear of mathematics from the minds of children and
make it a part of their daily routine even outside the school. We had many discussions and a review
process with some other teachers of schools across the country. The effort by the team has been to
accommodate all the comments.
In the end, I would like to place on record our gratefulness to Prof Krishna Kumar, Director,
NCERT, Prof G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT and Prof Hukum Singh, Head, DESM,  for giving
opportunity to me and the team to work on this challenging task. I am also grateful to
Prof J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics for his suggestions.
I am also grateful for the support of all those who were part of this team  including Prof S.K. Singh
Gautam, Dr V.P. Singh and Dr Ashutosh K. Wazalwar from NCERT, who have worked very hard to
make this possible. In the end I must thank the Publication Department of NCERT for its support and
advice and those from Vidya Bhawan who helped produce the book.
The process of developing materials is a continuous one and we would hope to make this book
better. Suggestions and comments on the book are most welcome.

A Note for the Teachers
This book is a continuation of the process and builds on what was initiated in Class VI. We had shared
with you the main points reflected in NCF-2005. These include relating mathematics to a wider
development of abilities in children, moving away from complex calculations and algorithms following,
to understanding and constructing a framework of understanding. The mathematical ideas in the mind
of the child grow neither by telling nor by merely giving explanations. For children to learn mathematics,
to be confident in it and understand the foundational ideas, they need to develop their own framework
of concepts. This would require a classroom where children discuss ideas, look for solutions of problems,
set new problems and find not only their own ways of solving problems but also their own definitions
with the language they can use and understand. These definitions need not be as general and complete
as the standard ones.
In the mathematics class it is important to help children read with understanding the textbook and
other references. The reading of materials is not normally considered to be related to learning of
mathematics but learning mathematics any further would require the child to comprehend the text.
The text in mathematics uses a language that has brevity. It requires the ability to deal with terseness
and with symbols, to follow logical arguments and appreciate the need for keeping certain factors and
constraints. Children need practice in translating mathematical statements into normal statements
expressing ideas in words and vice-a-versa. We would require children to become confident of using
language in words and also being able to communicate through mathematical statements.
Mathematics at the upper primary stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of
being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. Children often are
not able to work in terms of ideas alone. They need the comfort of context and/or models linked to
their experience to find meaning. This stage presents before us the challenge of engaging the children
while using the contexts but gradually moving them away from such dependence. So while children
should be able to identify the principles to be used in a contextual situation, they should not be dependent
or be limited to contexts. As we progress further in the middle school there would be greater requirement
from the child to be able to do this.
Learning mathematics is not about remembering solutions or methods but knowing how to solve
problems. Problem-solving strategies give learners opportunities to think rationally, enabling them to
understand and create methods as well as processes; they become active participants in the construction
of new knowledge rather than being passive receivers. Learners need to identify and define a problem,
select or design possible solutions and revise or redesign the steps, if required. The role of a teacher
gets modified to that of a guide and facilitator. Students need to be provided with activities and challenging
problems, along with sets of many problem-solving experiences.
On being presented a problem, children first need to decode it. They need to identify the knowledge
required for attempting it and build a model for it. This model could be in the form of an illustration or
a situation construct. We must remember that for generating proofs in geometry the figures constructed
are also models of the ideal dimensionless figure. These diagrams are, however, more abstract than
the concrete models required for attempting problems in arithmetic and algebra. Helping children to
develop the ability to construct appropriate models by breaking up the problems and evolving their own
strategies and analysis of problems is extremely important. This should replace prescriptive algorithms
to solve problems.
Teachers are expected to encourage cooperative learning. Children learn a lot in purposeful
conversation with each other. Our classrooms should develop in the students the desire and capacity
to learn from each other rather than compete. Conversation is not noise and consultation is not cheating.
It is a challenge to make possible classroom groups that benefit the most from being with each other
and in which each child contributes to the learning of the group. Teachers must recognise that
different children and different groups will use distinct strategies. Some of these strategies would
appear to be more efficient and some not as efficient. They would reflect the modelling done by each
group and would indicate the process of thinking used. It is inappropriate to identify the best strategy
or pull down incorrect strategies. We need to record all strategies adopted and analyse them. During
this, it is crucial to discuss why some of the strategies are unsuccessful. The class as a group can
improve upon the ineffective and unsuccessful strategies and correct them. This implies that we need
to complete each strategy rather than discard some as incorrect or inappropriate. Exposures to a
variety of strategies would deepen mathematical understanding and ability to learn from others. This
would also help them to understand the importance of being aware of what one is doing.
Enquiry to understand is one of the natural ways by which students acquire and construct knowledge.
The process can even begin with casual observations and end in generation and acquisition of knowledge.
This can be aided by providing examples for different forms of questioning-explorative, open-ended,
contextual, error detection etc. Students need to get exposed to challenging investigations. For example
in geometry there could be things like, experimenting with suitable nets for solids, visualising solids
through shadow play, slicing and elevations etc. In arithmetic we can make them explore relationships
among members, generalise the relationships, discover patterns and rules and then form algebraic
relations etc.
Children need the opportunity to follow logical arguments and find loopholes in the arguments
presented. This will lead them to understand the requirement of a proof.
At this stage topics like Geometry are poised to enter a formal stage. Provide activities that
encourage students to exercise creativity and imagination while discovering geometric vocabulary and
relationships using simple geometric tools.
Mathematics has to emerge as a subject of exploration and creation rather than an exercise of
finding answers to old and complicated problems. There is a need to encourage children to find many
different ways to solve problems. They also need to appreciate the use of many alternative algorithms
and strategies that may be adopted to solve a problem.
Topics like Integers, Fractions and Decimals, Symmetry have been presented here by linking them
with their introductory parts studied in earlier classes. An attempt has been made to link chapters with
each other and the ideas introduced in the initial chapters have been used to evolve concepts in the
subsequent chapters. Please devote enough time to the ideas of negative integers, rational numbers,
exploring statements in Geometry and visualising solids shapes.
We hope that the book will help children learn to enjoy mathematics and be confident in the
concepts introduced. We want to recommend the creation of opportunity for thinking individually and
collectively. Group discussions need to become a regular feature of mathematics classroom thereby
making learners confident about mathematics and make the fear of mathematics a thing of past.
We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the book and hope that you will
send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that you develop during the course of teaching, to be
included in the future editions.

1.1 INTRODUCTION
We have learnt about whole numbers and integers in Class VI.
We know that integers form a bigger collection of numbers
which contains whole numbers and negative numbers. What
other differences do you find between whole numbers and
integers? In this chapter, we will study more about integers,
their properties and operations. First of all, we will review and
revise what we have done about integers in our previous class.
1.2 RECALL
We know how to represent integers on a number line. Some integers are marked on the
number line given below.
Can you write these marked integers in ascending order? The ascending order of
these numbers is – 5, – 1, 3. Why did we choose  – 5 as the smallest number?
Some points are marked with integers on the following number line. Write these integers
in descending order.
The  descending order of these integers is 14, 8, 3, ...
The above number line has only a few integers filled. Write appropriate numbers at
each dot.

1. A number line representing integers is given below
–3 and –2 are marked by E and F respectively. Which integers are marked by B,
D, H, J, M and O?
Arrange 7, –5, 4, 0 and – 4 in ascending order and then mark them on a number
line to check your answer.
We have done addition and subtraction of integers in our previous class. Read the
following statements.
On a number line when we
add a positive integer, we move to the right.
add a negative integer, we move to the left.
(iii)
subtract a positive integer, we move to the left.
subtract a negative integer, we move to the right.
State whether the following statements are correct or incorrect. Correct those which
are wrong:
When two positive integers are added we get a positive integer.
When two negative integers are added we get a positive integer.
(iii)
When a  positive integer and a  negative integer are added, we always get a negative
integer.
Additive inverse of an integer 8 is (– 8) and additive inverse of (– 8) is 8.
For subtraction, we add the additive inverse of the integer that is being subtracted,
to the other integer.
(–10) + 3 = 10 – 3
(vii)
8 + (–7) – (– 4) = 8 + 7 – 4
Compare your answers with the answers given below:
Correct. For example:
(a) 56 + 73 = 129
(b) 113 + 82 = 195  etc.
Construct five more examples in support of this statement.
Incorrect, since (– 6) + (– 7) = – 13, which is not a positive integer. The correct
statement is: When two negative integers are added we  get a negative integer.
For example,
(a) (– 56) + (– 73) = – 129
(b) (– 113) + (– 82) = – 195, etc.
Construct five more examples on your own to verify this statement.

TRY THESE
(iii)
Incorrect, since – 9 + 16 = 7, which is not a negative integer. The correct statement is :
When one positive and one negative integers are added, we take their difference
and place the sign of the bigger integer. The bigger integer is decided by ignoring the
signs of both the integers. For example:
(a) (– 56) + (73) = 17
(b) (– 113) + 82 = – 31
(c) 16 + (– 23) = – 7
(d) 125 + (– 101) = 24
Construct five more examples for verifying this statement.
Correct. Some other examples of additive inverse are as given below:
Integer
Additive inverse
Thus, the additive inverse of any integer a is – a and additive inverse of (– a) is a.
Correct. Subtraction is opposite of addition and therefore, we add the additive
inverse of the integer that is being subtracted, to the other integer. For example:
(a) 56 – 73 =  56 + additive inverse of 73 = 56 + (–73) = –17
(b) 56 – (–73) =  56 + additive inverse of (–73) = 56 + 73 = 129
(c) (–79) – 45 = (–79) + (– 45) = –124
(d) (–100) – (–172) = –100 + 172 = 72 etc.
Write atleast five such examples to verify this statement.
Thus, we find that for any two integers a and b,
a – b = a + additive inverse of b = a + (– b)
a – (– b) = a + additive inverse of (– b) = a + b
Incorrect, since
(–10) + 3 = –7 and 10 – 3 = 7
therefore,
(–10) + 3 ≠ 10 – 3
(vii)
Incorrect, since,
8 + (–7) – (– 4) = 8 + (–7) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5
8 + 7 – 4 = 15 – 4 = 11
However,
8 + (–7) – (– 4) = 8 – 7 + 4
We have done various patterns with numbers in our previous class.

What do you observe? Is the sum of two integers always an integer?
Did you find a pair of integers whose sum is not an integer?
Since addition of integers gives integers, we say integers are closed under addition.
In general, for any two integers a and b, a + b is an integer.
1.3.2  Closure under Subtraction
What happens when we subtract an integer from another integer? Can we say that their
difference is also an integer?

What do you observe? Is there any pair of integers whose difference is not an integer?
Can we say integers are closed under subtraction? Yes, we can see that integers are
closed under subtraction.
Thus, if a and b are two integers then a – b is also an intger. Do the whole numbers
satisfy this property?
INTEGERS
1.3.3  Commutative Property
We know that 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8, that is, the whole numbers can be added in any order. In
other words, addition is commutative for whole numbers.
Can we say the same for integers also?
We have 5 + (– 6) = –1 and (– 6) + 5 = –1
So, 5 + (– 6) = (– 6) + 5
Are the following equal?
(i) (– 8) + (– 9) and (– 9) + (– 8)
(– 23) + 32 and 32 + (– 23)
(iii)
(– 45) + 0 and 0 + (– 45)
Try this with five other pairs of integers. Do you find any pair of integers for which the
sums are different when the order is changed? Certainly not. We say that addition is
commutative for integers.
In general, for any two integers a and b, we can say
a + b = b + a
 We know that subtraction is not commutative for whole numbers. Is it commutative
for  integers?
Consider the integers 5 and (–3).
Is 5 – (–3) the same as (–3) –5? No, because  5 – ( –3) = 5 + 3 = 8, and (–3) – 5
= – 3 – 5 = – 8.
Take atleast five different pairs of integers and check this.
We conclude that subtraction is not commutative for integers.
1.3.4  Associative Property
Observe the following examples:
Consider the integers –3, –2 and –5.
Look at (–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] and [(–5) + (–3)] + (–2).
In the first sum (–3) and (–2) are grouped together and in the second (–5) and (–3)
are grouped together. We will check whether we get different results.
(–5) + [(–3) + (–2)]
[(–5) + (–3)] + (–2)
MATHEMATICS
TRY THESE
In both the cases, we get –10.
i.e.,
(–5) + [(–3) + (–2)] = [(–5) + (–2)] + (–3)
Similarly consider  –3 , 1 and  –7.
( –3) + [1 + (–7)] = –3 + __________ = __________
[(–3) + 1] + (–7) = –2 + __________ = __________
Is (–3) + [1 + (–7)] same as [(–3) + 1] + (–7)?
Take five more such examples. You will not find any example for which the sums are
different. Addition is associative for integers.
In general for any integers a, b and c, we can say
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
1.3.5  Additive Identity
When we add zero to any whole number, we get the same whole number. Zero is an
additive identity for whole numbers. Is it an additive identity again for integers also?
Observe the following and fill in the blanks:
(i) (– 8) + 0  = – 8
(ii) 0 + (– 8) = – 8

(v) 0 + (–59) = _____
(vi) 0 + _____ = – 43
(vii) – 61 + _____ = – 61
(viii) _____ + 0 = _____
The above examples show that zero is an additive identity for integers.
You can verify it by adding zero to any other five integers.
In general, for any integer a
a + 0 = a = 0 + a

1.4  MULTIPLICATION OF INTEGERS
We can add and subtract integers. Let us now learn how to multiply integers.
1.4.1  Multiplication of a Positive and a Negative Integer
We know that multiplication of whole numbers is repeated addition. For example,
5 + 5 + 5 = 3 × 5 = 15
Can you represent addition of integers in the same way?
MATHEMATICS
We have from the following number line, (–5) + (–5) + (–5) = –15
But we can also write
(–5) + (–5) + (–5) = 3 × (–5)
Therefore,
3 × (–5) = –15
Similarly
(– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) + (– 4) = 5 × (– 4) = –20
(–3) + (–3) + (–3) + (–3) = __________ = __________
Also,
(–7) + (–7) + (–7) = __________ = __________
Let us see how to find the product of a positive integer and a negative integer without
using number line.
Let us find 3 × (–5) in a different way. First find 3 × 5 and then put minus sign (–)
before the product obtained. You get –15. That is we find – (3 × 5) to get –15.
Similarly,
5 × (– 4) = – (5×4) = – 20.
Find in a similar way,
4 × (– 8) = _____  = _____,  3 × (– 7) = _____ = _____
6 × (– 5) = _____  = _____,  2 × (– 9) = _____ = _____
Using this method we thus have,
10 × (– 43) = _____ – (10 × 43) = – 430
Till now we multiplied integers as (positive integer) × (negative integer).
Let us now multiply them as (negative integer) × (positive integer).
We first find –3 × 5.
To find this, observe the following pattern:
We have,
3 × 5 = 15
2 × 5 = 10 = 15 – 5
1 × 5 = 5 = 10 – 5
0 × 5 = 0 = 5 – 5
–1 × 5 = 0 – 5 = –5

TRY THESE
–2 × 5 = –5 – 5 = –10
–3 × 5 = –10 – 5 = –15
We already have
3 × (–5) = –15
So we get
(–3) × 5 = –15 = 3 × (–5)
Using such patterns, we also get (–5) × 4 = –20 = 5 × (– 4)
Using patterns, find (– 4) × 8, (–3) × 7, (– 6) × 5 and (– 2) × 9
Check whether,
(– 4) × 8 = 4 × (– 8), (– 3) × 7 = 3 × (–7), (– 6) × 5 = 6 × (– 5)
(– 2) × 9 = 2 × (– 9)
Using this we get,
(–33) × 5 = 33 × (–5) = –165
We thus find that while multiplying a positive integer and a negative integer, we
multiply them as whole numbers and put a minus sign (–) before the product. We
thus get a negative integer.

15 × (–16)
21 × (–32)

2. Check if (a)

(–23) × 20 = 23 × (–20)
Write five more such examples.
In general, for any two positive integers a and b we can say
a × (– b) = (– a) × b = – (a × b)
1.4.2  Multiplication of two Negative Integers
Can you find the product  (–3) × (–2)?
Observe the following:
–3 × 4 = – 12
–3 × 3 = –9 = –12 – (–3)
–3 × 2 = – 6 = –9 – (–3)
–3 × 1 = –3 = – 6 – (–3)
–3 × 0 = 0   = –3 – (–3)
–3 × –1 = 0 – (–3) = 0 + 3 = 3
–3 × –2 = 3 – (–3) = 3 + 3 = 6
Do you see any pattern? Observe how the products change.
MATHEMATICS
Based on this observation, complete the following:
–3 × –3 = _____ –3 × – 4 = _____
Now observe these products and fill in the blanks:
– 4 × 4 = –16
– 4 × 3 = –12  = –16 + 4
– 4 × 2 =  _____ = –12 + 4
– 4 × 1 = _____
– 4 × 0 = _____
– 4 × (–1) = _____
– 4 × (–2) = _____
– 4 × (–3) = _____
From these patterns we observe that,
(–3) × (–1) = 3 = 3 × 1
(–3) × (–2) = 6 = 3 × 2
(–3) × (–3) = 9 = 3 × 3
(– 4) × (–1) = 4 = 4 × 1
(– 4) × (–2) = 4 × 2   =  _____
(– 4) × (–3) = _____ = _____
So observing these products we can say that the product of two negative integers is
a positive integer. We multiply the two negative integers as whole numbers and put
the positive sign before the product.
Thus, we have
(–10) × (–12) = 120
Similarly
(–15) × (– 6) = 90
In general, for any two positive integers a and b,
(– a) × (– b) = a × b

1.4.3  Product of three or more Negative Integers
We observed that the product of two negative integers is a positive integer.
What will be the product of three negative integers? Four negative integers?
Let us observe the following examples:
(a) (– 4) × (–3) = 12
(b) (– 4) × (–3) × (–2) = [(– 4) × (–3)] × (–2) = 12 × (–2) = – 24
(c) (– 4) × (–3) × (–2) × (–1) = [(– 4) × (–3) × (–2)] × (–1) = (–24) × (–1)
(d) (–5) × [(–4) × (–3) × (–2) × (–1)] = (–5) × 24 = –120
From the above products we observe that
(a) the product of two negative integers
is a positive integer;
(b) the product of three negative integers
is a negative integer.
(c) product of four negative integers is
a positive integer.
What is the product of five negative integers in
So what will be the product of six negative
integers?
We further see that in (a) and (c) above,
the number of negative integers that are
multiplied are even [two and four respectively]
and the product obtained in (a) and (c) are
positive integers. The number of negative
integers that are multiplied in (b) and (d) is odd
and the products obtained in (b) and (d) are
negative integers.
We find that if the number of negative integers in a product is even, then the
product is a positive integer; if the number of negative integers in a product is odd,
then the product is a negative integer.
Justify it by taking five more examples of each kind.
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE

(–9) × ( –5) × 6 × (–3) is negative. Why?
(ii) What will be the sign of the product if we multiply together:
(a) 8 negative integers and 3 positive integers?
(b) 5 negative integers and 4 positive integers?
Euler in his book Ankitung zur
Algebra(1770), was one of
the first mathematicians to
attempt to prove
(–1) × (–1) = 1
A Special Case
Consider the following statements and
the resultant products:
(–1) × (–1) = +1
(–1) × (–1) × (–1) = –1
(–1) × (–1) × (–1) × (–1)  = +1
(–1) × (–1) × (–1) × (–1) × (–1) = –1
This means that if the integer
(–1) is multiplied even number of times,
the product is +1 and if the integer (–1)
is multiplied odd number of times, the
product is –1. You can check this by
making pairs of (–1) in the statement.
This is useful in working out products of
integers.

What do you observe? Can you find a pair of integers whose product is not an integer?
No. This gives us an idea that the product of two integers is again an integer. So we can
say that integers are closed under multiplication.
In general,
a × b is an integer, for all integers a and b.
Find the product of five more pairs of integers and verify the above statement.

0 is the additive identity whereas 1 is  the
multiplicative identity for integers. We get
additive inverse of an integer a when we multiply
(–1) to a, i.e.  a × (–1) = (–1) × a = – a
What are your observations? The above examples suggest multiplication is
commutative for integers. Write five more such examples and verify.
In general, for any two integers a and b,
a × b = b × a
1.5.3  Multiplication by Zero
We know that any whole number when multiplied by zero gives zero. Observe the following
products of negative integers and zero. These are obtained from the patterns done earlier.
(–3) × 0 = 0
0 × (– 4) = 0
– 5 × 0 = _____
0 × (– 6) = _____
This shows that the product of a negative integer and zero is zero.
In general, for any integer a,
a × 0 = 0 × a = 0
1.5.4  Multiplicative Identity
We know that 1 is the multiplicative identity for whole numbers.
Check that 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers as well. Observe the following
products of  integers with 1.
(–3) × 1 = –3
1 × 5 = 5
(– 4) × 1 = _____
1 × 8 = _____
1 × (–5) = _____
3 × 1 = _____
1 × (– 6) = _____
7 × 1 = _____
This shows that 1 is the multiplicative identity for integers also.
In general, for any integer a we have,
a × 1 = 1 × a = a
What happens when we multiply any integer with –1?  Complete the following:
(–3) × (–1) = 3
3 × (–1) = –3
(– 6) × (–1) = _____
(–1) × 13 = _____
(–1) × (–25) = _____
18 × (–1) = _____
What do you observe?
Can we say –1 is a multiplicative identity of integers? No.
INTEGERS
1.5.5  Associativity for Multiplication
Consider –3, –2 and 5.
Look at [(–3) × (–2)] × 5 and  (–3) × [(–2) × 5].
In the first case (–3) and (–2) are grouped together and in the second (–2) and 5 are
grouped together.
We see that [(–3) × (–2)] × 5 = 6 × 5 = 30
(–3) × [(–2) × 5] = (–3) × (–10) = 30
So, we get the same answer in both the cases.
Thus,
[(–3) × (–2)] × 5 = (–3) × [(–2) × 5]
Look at this and complete the products:
[(7) × (– 6)] × 4 = __________ × 4 = __________
7 × [(– 6) × 4] = 7 × __________ = __________
Is [7 × (– 6)] × 4 = 7 × [(– 6) × 4]?
Does the grouping of integers affect the product of integers? No.
In general, for any three integers a, b and c
(a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
Take any five values for a, b and c each and verify this property.
Thus, like whole numbers, the product of three integers does not depend upon
the grouping of integers and this is called the associative property for multiplication
of integers.
1.5.6  Distributive Property
We know
16 × (10 + 2) = (16 × 10) + (16 × 2)
[Distributivity of multiplication over addition]
Let us check if this is true for integers also.
Observe the following:
(a) (–2) × (3 + 5) = –2 × 8 = –16
[(–2) × 3] + [(–2) × 5] = (– 6) + (–10) = –16
(–2) × (3 + 5) = [(–2) × 3] + [(–2) × 5]
(b) (– 4) × [(–2) + 7] = (– 4) × 5 = –20
[(– 4) × (–2)] + [(– 4) × 7] =  8  + (–28)  = –20
(– 4) × [(–2) + 7]  = [(– 4) × (–2)] + [(– 4) × 7]
(c) (– 8) × [(–2) + (–1)] = (– 8) × (–3) = 24
[(– 8) × (–2)] + [(– 8) × (–1)] =  16  + 8  = 24
(– 8) × [(–2) + (–1)]  = [(– 8) × (–2)] + [(– 8) × (–1)]

Can we say that the distributivity of multiplication over addition is true for integers
also? Yes.
In general, for any integers a, b and c,
a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c
Take atleast five different values for each of a, b and c and verify the above Distributive
property.
(i) Is 10 × [(6 + (–2)] = 10 × 6 + 10 × (–2)?
(ii) Is (–15) × [(–7) + (–1)] = (–15) × (–7) + (–15) × (–1)?
Now consider the following:
Can we say 4 × (3 – 8) = 4 × 3 – 4 × 8?
Let us check:
4 × (3 – 8) = 4 × (–5) = –20
4 × 3 – 4 × 8 = 12  – 32 = –20
4 × (3 – 8) = 4 × 3 – 4 × 8.
Look at the following:
( –5) × [( – 4)  – ( – 6)] = ( –5) × 2 =  –10
[( –5) × ( – 4)]  – [ ( –5) × ( – 6)]  = 20  – 30 =  –10
( –5) × [( – 4)  – ( – 6)] = [( –5) × ( – 4)]  – [ ( –5) × ( – 6)]
Check this for ( –9) × [ 10  – ( –3)] and [( –9) × 10 ]  – [ ( –9) × ( –3)]
You will find that these are also equal.
In general, for any three integers a, b and c,
a × (b – c) = a × b – a × c
Take atleast five different values for each of a, b and c and verify this property.
(i) Is 10 × (6 – (–2)] = 10 × 6 – 10 × (–2)?
Is (–15) × [(–7) – (–1)] = (–15) × (–7) – (–15) × (–1)?
1.5.7  Making Multiplication Easier
Consider the following:
(i) We can find (–25) × 37 × 4 as
[(–25) × 37] × 4 = (– 925)× 4 = –3700
INTEGERS
TRY THESE
Or, we can do it this way,
(–25) × 37 × 4 = (–25) × 4 × 37 = [(–25) × 4] × 37 = (–100) × 37 = –3700
Which is the easier way?
Obviously the second way is easier because multiplication of (–25) and 4 gives
–100 which is easier to multiply with 37. Note that the second way involves
commutativity and associativity of integers.
So, we find that the commutativity, associativity and distributivity of integers help to
make our calculations simpler. Let us further see how calculations can be made
easier using these properties.
Find 16 × 12
16 × 12 can be written as 16 × (10 + 2).
16 × 12 =   16 × (10 + 2)  =  16 × 10 + 16 × 2 = 160 + 32 = 192
(iii)
(–23) × 48 = (–23) × [50 – 2]  = (–23) × 50 – (–23) × 2 = (–1150) – (– 46)

(–35) × (–98) = (–35) × [(–100) + 2] = (–35) × (–100) + (–35) × 2
= 3500 + (–70) = 3430
52 × (– 8) + (–52) × 2
(–52) × 2 can also be written as  52 × (–2).
Therefore, 52 × (– 8) + (–52) × 2 = 52 × (– 8) + 52 × (–2)
= 52 × [(– 8) + (–2)] = 52 × [(–10)] = –520

(ii) (–20) × (–2) × (–5) × 7
(iii) (–1) × (–5) ×  (– 4) × (– 6)
SOLUTION
(i) (–18) × (–10) × 9 = [(–18) × (–10)] × 9 = 180 × 9 = 1620
(ii) (–20) × (–2) × (–5) × 7 = – 20 × (–2 × –5) × 7 = [–20 × 10] × 7 = – 1400
(iii) (–1) × (–5) ×  (– 4) × (– 6) = [(–1) × (–5)] × [(– 4) × (– 6)] = 5 × 24 = 120
EXAMPLE 3

(–30) × [13 + (–3)] = (–30) × 10 = –300
MATHEMATICS
[(–30) × 13] + [(–30) × (–3)]  = –390 + 90 = –300
So, (–30) × [13 + (–3)] =  [(–30) × 13] + [(–30) × (–3)]
EXAMPLE 4 In a class test containing 15 questions, 4 marks are given for every
correct answer and (–2) marks are given for every incorrect answer.
(i) Gurpreet attempts all questions but only 9 of her answers are correct.
What is her total score? (ii) One of her friends gets only 5 answers
correct. What will be her score?
SOLUTION
(i) Marks given for one correct answer = 4
So, marks given for 9 correct answers = 4 × 9 = 36
Marks given for one incorrect answer = – 2
So, marks given for 6 (= 15 – 9) incorrect answers = (–2) × 6 = –12
Therefore, Gurpreet’s total score  = 36 + ( –12) = 24
(ii) Marks given for one correct answer = 4
So, marks given for 5 correct answers   = 4 × 5 = 20
Marks given for one incorrect answer = (–2)
So, marks given for 10 (=15 – 5) incorrect answers = (–2) × 10 = –20
Therefore, her friend’s total score = 20 + ( –20) = 0
EXAMPLE 5
Suppose we represent the distance above the ground by a positive integer
and that below the ground by a negative integer, then answer the following:
(i) An elevator descends into a mine shaft at the rate of 5 metre per minute. What will
be its position after one hour?
(ii) If it begins to descend from 15 m above the ground, what will be its position after 45
minutes?
SOLUTION
Since the elevator is going down, so the distance covered by it will be represented
by a negative integer.
Change in position of the elevator in one minute = – 5 m
Position of the elevator after 60 minutes = (–5) × 60 = – 300 m, i.e., 300 m below
ground level.
Change in position of the elevator in 45 minutes = (–5) × 45 = –225 m, i.e., 225 m
below ground level.
So, the final position of the elevator = –225 + 15 = –210 m, i.e., 210 m below
ground level.

1.6  DIVISION OF INTEGERS
We know that division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Let us see an example
for whole numbers.
Since 3 × 5 = 15
So    15 ÷ 5 = 3 and 15 ÷ 3 = 5
Similarly, 4 × 3 = 12 gives 12 ÷ 4 = 3 and 12 ÷ 3 = 4
We can say for each multiplication statement of whole numbers there are two
division statements.
Can you write multiplication statement and its corresponding divison statements
for integers?
 Observe the following and complete it.
Multiplication Statement
2 × (– 6) = (–12)
(– 4) × 5 = (–20)
(– 8) × (–9) = 72
(–3) × (–7) = _____
(– 8) × 4 = ____
5 × (– 9) = _____
(–10) × (–5) =
Corresponding Division Statements
(–12) ÷ (– 6) = 2         ,     (–12) ÷ 2 = (– 6)
(–20) ÷ (5) = (– 4)      ,     (–20) ÷ (– 4) = 5
72 ÷ _____ = _____  ,     72 ÷ _____ = _____
_____ ÷ (–3) = ____ ,

From the above we observe that :
(–12) ÷ 2 = (– 6)
(–20) ÷ (5) = (– 4)
(–32) ÷ 4 = – 8
(– 45) ÷ 5 = – 9
We observe that when we divide a negative integer by a positive integer, we divide
them as whole numbers and then put a minus sign (–) before the quotient. We, thus,
get a negative integer.
Find:
(a) (–100) ÷ 5
(b) (–81) ÷ 9
(c) (–75) ÷  5
(d) (–32) ÷ 2

INTEGERS
 We also observe that:
72  ÷  (–8) = –9
50 ÷  (–10) = –5
72  ÷  (–9) = – 8
50  ÷  (–5) = –10
So we can say that when we divide a positive integer by a negative
integer, we first divide them as whole numbers and then put a minus
sign (–) before the quotient. That is, we get a negative integer.
In general, for any two positive integers a and b
a ÷  (–b) = (– a) ÷  b
where b ≠ 0
Find:   (a)  125 ÷ (–25)      (b) 80 ÷ (–5)      (c) 64 ÷ (–16)
 Lastly, we observe that
(–12)  ÷  (– 6) = 2; (–20)  ÷  (– 4) = 5; (–32)  ÷  (– 8) = 4; (– 45)  ÷  (–9) = 5
So, we can say that when we divide a negative integer by a negative integer, we first
divide them as whole numbers and then put a positive sign (+). That is, we get a positive
integer.
In general, for any two positive integers a and b
(– a) ÷  (– b) = a ÷  b
where b ≠ 0
Find:     (a)   (–36)  ÷  (– 4)           (b)   (–201)  ÷  (–3)           (c)   (–325)  ÷  (–13)

What do you observe? We observe that integers are not closed under division.
Justify it by taking five more examples of your own.
 We know that division is not commutative for whole numbers. Let us check it for
integers also.
MATHEMATICS
You can see from the table that (– 8) ÷ (– 4) ≠ (– 4) ÷ (– 8).
Is (– 9) ÷ 3 the same as 3 ÷ (– 9)?
Is (– 30) ÷ (– 6) the same as (– 6) ÷ (– 30)?
Can we say that division is commutative for integers? No.
You can verify it by taking five more pairs of integers.
 Like whole numbers, any integer divided by zero is meaningless and zero divided by
an integer other than zero is equal to zero i.e., for any integer a, a ÷ 0 is not defined
but 0 ÷ a = 0 for a ≠ 0.
 When we divide a whole number by 1 it gives the same whole number. Let us check
whether it is true for negative integers also.
Observe the following :
(– 8) ÷ 1 = (– 8)
(–11) ÷ 1 = –11
(–13) ÷ 1 = –13
(–25) ÷ 1 = ____
(–37) ÷ 1 = ____
(– 48) ÷ 1 = ____
This shows that negative integer divided by 1 gives the same negative integer.
So, any integer divided by 1 gives the same integer.
In general, for any integer a,
a ÷ 1 = a
 What happens when we divide any integer by (–1)? Complete the following table
(– 8) ÷ (–1) = 8
11 ÷ (–1) = –11
13 ÷ (–1) = ____
(–25) ÷ (–1) = ____
(–37) ÷ (–1) = ____
– 48 ÷ (–1) = ____
What do you observe?
We can say that if any integer is divided by (–1) it does not give the same integer.
Can we say
[(–16) ÷ 4] ÷ (–2)  is the same as
(–16) ÷ [4 ÷ (–2)]?
We know that
[(–16) ÷ 4] ÷ (–2) = (– 4) ÷ (–2) = 2
(–16) ÷ [4 ÷ (–2)] = (–16) ÷ (–2) = 8
[(–16) ÷ 4] ÷ (–2) ≠ (–16) ÷ [4 ÷ (–2)]
Can you say that division is associative for integers? No.
Verify it by taking five more examples of your own.

INTEGERS
answered all the questions and scored (–12) marks though he got 4
correct answers. How many incorrect answers had they attempted?
SOLUTION
(i) Marks given for one correct answer = 5
So, marks given for 10 correct answers = 5 × 10 = 50
Radhika’s score = 30
Marks obtained for incorrect answers = 30 – 50 = – 20
Marks given for one incorrect answer = (–2)
Therefore, number of incorrect answers = (–20) ÷ (–2) = 10
(ii) Marks given for 4 correct answers = 5 ◊ 4 = 20
Jay’s score = –12
Marks obtained for incorrect answers = –12 – 20 = – 32
Marks given for one incorrect answer = (–2)
Therefore number of incorrect answers = (–32) ÷ (–2) = 16
EXAMPLE 7
A shopkeeper earns a profit of  ` 1 by selling one pen and incurs a loss
of 40 paise per pencil while selling pencils of her old stock.
(i) In a particular month she incurs a loss of ` 5. In this period, she sold 45 pens. How
many pencils did she sell in this period?
(ii) In the next month she earns neither profit nor loss. If she sold 70 pens, how many
pencils did she sell?
SOLUTION
(i) Profit earned by selling one pen = ` 1
Profit earned by selling 45 pens = ` 45, which we denote by  + ` 45
Total loss given =  ` 5, which we denote by – ` 5
Profit earned + Loss incurred = Total loss
Therefore, Loss incurred = Total Loss – Profit earned
= ` (– 5 – 45) = ` (–50) = –5000 paise
Loss incurred by selling one pencil =  40 paise which we write as  – 40 paise
So, number of pencils sold  =    (–5000) ÷ (– 40) = 125 pencils.
(ii) In the next month there is neither profit nor loss.
So, Profit earned + Loss incurred = 0
MATHEMATICS
i.e., Profit earned = – Loss incurred.
Now, profit earned by selling 70 pens = ` 70
Hence, loss incurred by selling pencils =  ` 70 which we indicate by – ` 70 or
– 7,000 paise.
Total number of pencils sold = (–7000) ÷ (– 40) = 175 pencils.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Integers are a bigger collection of numbers which is formed by whole numbers and
their negatives. These were introduced in Class VI.
2. You have studied in the earlier class, about the representation of integers on the
number line and their addition and subtraction.
3. We now study the properties satisfied by addition and subtraction.
(a) Integers are closed for addition and subtraction both. That is, a + b and
a – b are again integers, where a and b are any integers.
(b) Addition is commutative for integers, i.e., a + b = b + a for all integers
a and b.
(c) Addition is associative for integers, i.e., (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all integers
a, b and c.
(d) Integer 0 is the identity under addition. That is, a + 0 = 0 + a = a  for every
integer a.
4. We studied, how integers could be multiplied, and found that product of a positive
and a negative integer is a negative integer, whereas the product of two negative
integers is a positive integer. For example, – 2 × 7 = – 14 and – 3 × – 8 = 24.
5. Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd
number of negative integers is negative.
6. Integers show some properties under multiplication.
(a) Integers are closed under multiplication. That is, a × b is an integer for any two
integers a and b.
(b) Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is, a × b = b × a for any integers
a and b.
(c) The integer 1 is the identity under multiplication, i.e., 1 × a = a × 1 = a for any
integer a.
(d) Multiplication is associative for integers, i.e., (a × b) × c = a × (b × c) for any
three integers a, b and c.
7. Under addition and multiplication, integers show a property called distributive prop-
erty. That is, a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c for any three integers a, b and c.
MATHEMATICS
8. The properties of commutativity, associativity under addition and multiplication, and
the distributive property help us to make our calculations easier.
9. We also learnt how to divide integers. We found that,
(a) When a positive integer is divided by a negative integer, the quotient obtained is
a negative integer and vice-versa.
(b) Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives a positive integer
as quotient.
10. For any integer a, we have
(a) a ÷ 0 is not defined
(b) a ÷ 1 = a

2.3  MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS
You know how to find the area of a rectangle. It is equal to length × breadth. If the length
and breadth of a rectangle are 7 cm and 4 cm respectively, then what will be its area? Its
area would be 7 × 4 = 28 cm2.

For improper fractions also we have,
2× 3  = 2× 5
3× 7  = ?
4× 5   = ?
Thus, to multiply a whole number with a proper or an improper fraction, we
multiply the whole number with the numerator of the fraction, keeping the
denominator same.

If the product is an improper fraction express it as a mixed fraction.

So, both the shaded portions together will represent 1
2  of 2.
Combine the 2 shaded 1
2  parts. It represents 1.
So, we say 1
2  of 2 is 1. We can also get it as 1

2 . Also, 1
2  × 3 = 3
Thus, 1
2  of 3 = 1
2  × 3 = 3
So we see that ‘of’ represents multiplication.
Farida has 20 marbles. Reshma has 1 th
of the number of marbles what
Farida has. How many marbles Reshma has? As, ‘of ’ indicates multiplication,
so, Reshma has 1 × 20
= 4 marbles.
Similarly, we have 1
2 of 16 is  1 ×16
2  =  8.

Let us now see how to find the product of two fractions like 1
To do this we first learn to find the products like 1
(a) How do we find  1
3 of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of
the three parts represents 1
3 of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and
shade it as shown in Fig 2.8.
(b) How will you find 1
2 of this shaded part? Divide this one-third (1
3 ) shaded part into
two equal parts. Each of these two parts represents 1
2  of  1
3  i.e., 1
2  × 1
3 (Fig 2.9).
Take out 1 part of these two and name it ‘A’. ‘A’ represents 1
2  × 1
(c) What fraction is ‘A’ of the whole? For this, divide each of the remaining 1
3  parts also
in two equal parts. How many such equal parts do you have now?
There are six such equal parts. ‘A’ is one of these parts.
So, ‘A’ is 1
6  of the whole. Thus,  1
2  × 1
3   =  1
How did we decide that ‘A’ was 1
6  of the whole? The whole was divided in 6 = 2 × 3
parts and 1 = 1 × 1 part was taken out of it.
Thus,
2  × 1
3  = 1
6   = 1×1

two equal parts. One part out of it is the shape we considered. What will it represent?
It will represent 1

So, we are required to divide a whole number by a fraction or a fraction by another
fraction. Let us see how to do that.
2.4.1  Division of Whole Number by a Fraction
Let us find 1÷ 1
We divide a whole into a number of equal parts such that each part is half of the whole.
The number of such half ( 1
2 ) parts would be 1÷ 1
2 . Observe the figure (Fig 2.11). How
many half parts do you see?
There are two half parts.
1 ÷ 1
2  = 2. Also,

John has ` 15.50 and Salma has ` 15.75. Who has more money? To find this we need
to compare the decimal numbers 15.50 and 15.75. To do this, we first compare the digits
on the left of the decimal point, starting from the leftmost digit. Here both the digits 1 and
5, to the left of the decimal point, are same. So we compare the digits on the right of the
decimal point starting from the tenths place. We find that 5 < 7, so we say
15.50 < 15.75. Thus, Salma has more money than John.
If the digits at the tenths place are also same then compare the digits at the hundredths
place and so on.
Now compare quickly, 35.63 and 35.67; 20.1 and 20.01; 19.36 and 29.36.
While converting lower units of money, length and weight, to their higher units, we are
required to use decimals. For example, 3 paise = ` 3
100 = ` 0.03, 5g =
1000  kg
= 0.005 kg,  7 cm = 0.07 m.
Write 75 paise = ` ______,

2.6  MULTIPLICATION OF DECIMAL NUMBERS
Reshma purchased 1.5kg vegetable at the rate of ` 8.50 per kg. How much money should
she pay? Certainly it would be ` (8.50 × 1.50). Both 8.5 and 1.5 are decimal numbers.
So, we have come across a situation where we need to know how to multiply two deci-
mals. Let us now learn the multiplication of two decimal numbers.
First we find 0.1 × 0.1.
Now, 0.1 = 1
10 . So, 0.1 × 0.1 = 1
10  = 1×1
10×10  = 1
100  = 0.01.
Let us see it’s pictorial representation (Fig 2.13)
The fraction 1
10  represents 1 part out of 10 equal parts.
The shaded part in the picture represents 1
We know that,
10  means 1
10  of 1
10 . So, divide this
th part into 10 equal parts and take one part
out of it.
Fig 2.13
FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS
Thus, we have, (Fig 2.14).
Fig 2.14
The dotted square is one part out of 10 of the 1
th part. That is, it represents
10  or  0.1 × 0.1.
Can the dotted square be represented in some other way?
How many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14?
There are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01.
Hence, 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01.
Note that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is one digit to the right of
the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two digits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point.
Let us now find 0.2 × 0.3.
We have, 0.2 × 0.3 = 2
As we did for 1
, let us divide the square into 10
equal parts and take three parts out of it, to get 3
10 . Again
divide each of these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and
take two from each. We get 2
The dotted squares represent 2
10  or 0.2 × 0.3. (Fig 2.15)
Since there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also
reprsent 0.06.
Fig 2.15
MATHEMATICS
Thus, 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.06.
Observe that 2 × 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in
0.06 is 2 (= 1 + 1).
Check whether this applies to 0.1 × 0.1 also.
Find 0.2 × 0.4 by applying these observations.
While finding 0.1 × 0.1 and 0.2 × 0.3, you might have noticed that first we
multiplied them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 × 0.1, we found
01 × 01 or 1 × 1. Similarly in 0.2 × 0.3 we found 02 × 03 or 2 × 3.
Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved
towards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted
is obtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the
decimal numbers that are being multiplied.
Let us now find 1.2 × 2.5.
Multiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is 1 digit to the right
of the decimal point. So, count 1 + 1 = 2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300
and move towards left. We get 3.00 or 3.
Find in a similar way 1.5 × 1.6, 2.4 × 4.2.
While multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the
decimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2 = 3 (Why?) digits starting from
the rightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 × 1.25 = 3.225
Find 2.7 × 1.35.
1. Find:
(i) 2.7 × 4
(ii) 1.8 × 1.2
(iii) 2.3 × 4.35
2. Arrange the products obtained in (1) in descending order.
EXAMPLE 7 The side of an equilateral triangle is 3.5 cm. Find its perimeter.
SOLUTION
All the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.
So, length of each side = 3.5 cm
Thus, perimeter = 3 × 3.5 cm = 10.5 cm
EXAMPLE 8 The length of a rectangle is 7.1 cm and its breadth is 2.5 cm. What
is the area of the rectangle?
SOLUTION
Length of the rectangle = 7.1 cm
Breadth of the rectangle = 2.5 cm
Therefore, area of the rectangle = 7.1 × 2.5 cm2 = 17.75 cm2

2.6.1  Multiplication of Decimal Numbers by 10, 100 and 1000
Reshma observed that 2.3 = 23
10  whereas 2.35 = 235
100 . Thus, she found that depending
on the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with
denominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen if a decimal number is multiplied
by 10 or 100 or 1000.
Let us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000.
Have a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks:
1.76 × 10  = 176
100 × 10 = 17.6

1.76 × 1000 = 176
100  × 1000 = 1760   or
2.35 ×1000 = ___
12.356 × 1000 = ___
1760.0
0.5 × 10 = 5
10  × 10 = 5     ;     0.5 × 100 = ___     ;     0.5 × 1000 = ___
Observe the shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are
multiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 × 10 = 17.6, the digits are same i.e., 1, 7 and 6. Do
you observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the
decimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place.
Note that 10 has one zero over 1.
In 1.76×100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many
digits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two
places.
Note that 100 has two zeros over one.
Do you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also?
So we say, when a decimal number is multiplied by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits in
the product are same as in the decimal number but the decimal
point in the product is shifted to the right by as, many of places as
there are zeros over one.
Based on these observations we can now say
0.07 × 10 = 0.7, 0.07 × 100 = 7 and 0.07 × 1000 = 70.
Can you now tell 2.97 × 10 = ?    2.97 × 100 = ?    2.97 × 1000 = ?

2.7  DIVISION OF DECIMAL NUMBERS
Savita was preparing a design to decorate her classroom. She needed a few coloured
strips of paper of length 1.9 cm each. She had a strip of coloured paper of length 9.5 cm.
How many pieces of the required length will she get out of this strip? She thought it would
be 9.5
cm. Is she correct?
Both 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of
decimal numbers too!
2.7.1  Division by 10, 100 and 1000
Let us find the division of a decimal number by 10, 100 and 1000.
Consider  31.5 ÷ 10.
31.5 ÷ 10 = 315
10  = 315
100  = 3.15
Similarly, 31 5 100
0 315
Let us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000. This may
help us in dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000 in a shorter way.
31.5 ÷ 10 = 3.15
231.5 ÷ 10 =___
1.5 ÷ 10 =___
29.36 ÷ 10 =___
31.5 ÷ 100 = 0.315
231.5 ÷ 10 =___
1.5 ÷ 100 =___
29.36 ÷ 100 =___
31.5 ÷ 1000 = 0.0315 231.5 ÷ 1000 =___
1.5 ÷ 1000 =___
29.36 ÷ 1000 =___
FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS
Take 31.5 ÷ 10 = 3.15. In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are
same i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the
quotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal
point has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one
zero over 1.
Consider now 31.5 ÷ 100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the
digits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient?
It has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two zeros over1.
So we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the
number and the quotient are same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the
left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Using this observation let us now
quickly find:        2.38 ÷ 10 = 0.238,  2.38 ÷ 100 = 0.0238, 2.38 ÷ 1000 = 0.00238
2.7.2  Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number
Let us find 6.4
. Remember we also write it as 6.4 ÷ 2.
So, 6.4 ÷ 2 = 64
10  ÷ 2  = 64
as learnt in fractions..
= 64 1
Or, let us first divide 64 by 2. We get 32. There is one digit to the right of the decimal
point in 6.4. Place the decimal in 32 such that there would be one digit to its
right. We get 3.2 again.
To find 19.5 ÷ 5, first find 195 ÷5. We get 39. There is one digit to the
right of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there
would be one digit to its right. You will get 3.9.
Now, 12.96 ÷ 4 = 1296
100 ÷
= 1296
4 = 1
= 1 × 324
= 3.24
Or, divide 1296 by 4. You get 324. There are two digits to the right of the decimal in
12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you will get 3.24.
Note that here and in the next section, we have considered only those
divisions in which, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely
divisible by another number to give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 ÷ 5, the
number 195 when divided by 5, leaves remainder zero.
However, there are situations in which the number may not be completely
divisible by another number, i.e., we may not get remainder zero. For example, 195 ÷ 7.
We deal with such situations in later classes.
Thus, 40.86 ÷ 6 = 6.81

SOLUTION
The average of 4.2, 3.8 and 7.6 is 4.2

2.7.3 Division of a Decimal Number by another Decimal
Number
Let us find 25.5
0.5  i.e., 25.5 ÷ 0.5.
We have 25.5 ÷ 0.5 = 255
= 255
5 = 51.
Thus, 25.5 ÷ 0.5 = 51
What do you observe? For 25.5
0.5 , we find that there is one digit to the right of the
decimal in 0.5. This could be converted to whole number by dividing by 10. Accordingly
25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10.
Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5.
So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255.
Thus,
22.5 ÷ 1.5  = 22 5
= 225
15  = 15
and 15 2
in a similar way.
Let us now find 20.55 ÷ 1.5.
We can write it is as 205.5 ÷ 15, as discussed above. We get 13.7. Find 3.96
, 2.31
Consider now, 33.725
. We can write it as 3372.5

EXAMPLE 10 Each side of a regular polygon is 2.5 cm in length. The perimeter of the
polygon is 12.5cm. How many sides does the polygon have?
SOLUTION
The perimeter of a regular polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its
equal sides = 12.5 cm.
Length of each side = 2.5 cm. Thus, the number of sides = 12.5
2.5  = 125
25  = 5

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. We have learnt about fractions and decimals alongwith the operations of addition and
subtraction on them, in the earlier class.
2. We now study the operations of multiplication and division on fractions as well as on
decimals.
3. We have learnt how to multiply fractions. Two fractions are multiplied by multiplying
their numerators and denominators seperately and writing the product as
productof numerators
productof denominators .  For example, 2
4. A fraction acts as an operator ‘of ’. For example, 1
2  of  2 is 1
2  × 2 = 1.
MATHEMATICS
5. (a)
The product of two proper fractions is less than each of the fractions that are
multiplied.
The product of a proper and an improper fraction is less than the improper
fraction and greater than the proper fraction.
The product of two imporper fractions is greater than the two fractions.
6. A reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting it upside down.
7. We have seen how to divide two fractions.
(a) While dividing a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number
with the reciprocal of that fraction.
For example,
(b) While dividing a fraction by a whole number we multiply the fraction by the
reciprocal of the whole number.
For example, 2
(c) While dividing one fraction by another fraction, we multuiply the first fraction by
the reciprocal of the other. So, 2
8. We also learnt how to multiply two decimal numbers. While multiplying two decimal
numbers, first multiply them as whole numbers. Count the number of digits to the right
of the decimal point in both the decimal numbers. Add the number of digits counted.
Put the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place.
The count should be the sum obtained earlier.
For example, 0.5 × 0.7 = 0.35
9. To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the
number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1.
Thus  0.53 × 10 = 5.3,     0.53 × 100 = 53,      0.53 × 1000 = 530
10. We have seen how to divide decimal numbers.
(a) To divide a decimal number by a whole number, we first divide them as whole
numbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number.
For example, 8.4 ÷ 4 = 2.1
Note that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero.
(b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal
number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the
quotient.
So, 23.9 ÷ 10 = 2.39,23.9 ÷ 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 ÷ 1000 = 0.0239
(c) While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by
equal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number. Then
divide. Thus, 2.4 ÷ 0.2 = 24 ÷ 2 = 12.
DATA HANDLING
3.1  INTRODUCTION
In your previous classes, you have dealt with various types of data. You have learnt to
collect data, tabulate and put it in the form of bar graphs. The collection, recording and
presentation of data help us organise our experiences and draw inferences from them.
In this Chapter, we will take one more step towards learning how to do this. You will
come across some more kinds of data and graphs. You have seen several kinds of data
through newspapers, magazines, television and other sources. You also know that all
data give us some sort of information. Let us look at some common forms of data that
you come across:

What do these collections of data tell you?
For example you can say that the highest maximum temperature was in Jammu on
20.06.2006 (Table 3.1) or we can say that, on Wednesday, no child was absent.
(Table 3.3)
Can we organise and present these data in a different way, so that their analysis and
interpretation becomes better? We shall address such questions in this Chapter.
3.2  COLLECTING DATA
The data about the temperatures of cities (Table 3.1) can tell us many things, but it cannot
tell us the city which had the highest maximum temperature during the year. To find that, we
need to collect data regarding the highest maximum temperature reached in each of these
cities during the year. In that case, the temperature chart of one particular date of the year,
as given in Table 3.1 will not be sufficient.
This shows that a given collection of data may not give us a specific information related
to that data. For this we need to collect data keeping in mind that specific information. In
the above case the specific information needed by us, was about the highest maximum
temperature of the cities during the year, which we could not get from Table 3.1
Thus, before collecting data, we need to know what we would use it for.
Given below are a few situations.
You want to study the
Performance of your class in Mathematics.
Performance of India in football or in cricket.
Female literacy rate in a given area, or
Number of children below the age of five in the families around you.
What kind of data would you need in the above situations? Unless and until you collect
appropriate data, you cannot know the desired information. What is the appropriate data
for each?
Discuss with your friends and identify the data you would need for each.
Some of this data is easy to collect and some difficult.
3.3  ORGANISATION OF DATA
When we collect data, we have to record and organise it. Why do we need to
do that? Consider the following example.
Ms Neelam, class teacher wanted to find how children had performed
in English. She writes down the marks obtained by the students in the
following way:
23, 35, 48, 30, 25, 46, 13, 27, 32, 38
In this form, the data was not easy to understand. She also did not know whether her
impression of the students matched their performance.
DATA HANDLING
Neelam’s colleague helped her organise the data in the following way (Table 3.4).

In this form, Neelam was able to know which student has got how many marks. But she
wanted more. Deepika suggested another way to organise this data (Table 3.5).

Now Neelam was able to see who had done the best and who needed help.
Many kinds of data we come across are put in tabular form. Our school rolls, progress
report, index in the notebooks, temperature record and many others are all in tabular
form. Can you think of a few more data that you come across in tabular form?
When we put data in a proper table it becomes easy to understand and interpret.
Weigh (in kg) atleast 20 children (girls and boys) of your class. Organise the data, and
answer the following questions using this data.
(i) Who is the heaviest of all?
(ii) What is the most common weight?
(iii) What is the difference between your weight and that of your best friend?
3.4  REPRESENTATIVE VALUES
You might be aware of the term average and would have come across statements involving
the term ‘average’ in your day-to-day life:
z Isha spends on an average of about 5 hours daily for her studies.
TRY THESE
MATHEMATICS
z The average temperature at this time of the year is about 40 degree celsius.
z The average age of pupils in my class is 12 years.
z The average attendance of students in a school during its final examination was
98 per cent.
Many more of such statements could be there. Think about the statements given above.
Do you think that the child in the first statement studies exactly for 5 hours daily?
Or, is the temperature of the given place during that particular time always 40 degrees?
Or, is the age of each pupil in that class 12 years? Obviously not.
Then what do these statements tell you?
By average we understand that Isha, usually, studies for 5 hours. On some days,
she may study for less number of hours and on the other days she may study longer.
Similarly, the average temperature of 40 degree celsius, means that, very often,
the temperature at this time of the year is around 40 degree celsius. Sometimes, it may
be less than 40 degree celsius and at other times, it may be more than 40°C.
Thus, we realise that average is a number that represents or shows the central tendency
of a group of observations or data. Since average lies between the highest and the lowest
value of the given data so, we say average is a measure of the central tendency of the group
of data. Different forms of data need different forms of representative or central value to
describe it. One of these representative values is the “Arithmetic mean”. You will learn
about the other representative values in the later part of the chapter.
3.5  ARITHMETIC MEAN
The most common representative value of a group of data is the arithmetic mean or the
mean. To understand this in a better way, let us look at the following example:
Two vessels contain 20 litres and 60 litres of milk respectively. What is the amount that
each vessel would have, if both share the milk equally? When we ask this question we are
seeking the arithmetic mean.
In the above case, the average or the arithmetic mean would be
Total quantity of milk
Number of vessels
litres = 40 litres.
Thus, each vessels would have 40 litres of milk.
The average or Arithmetic Mean (A.M.) or simply mean is defined as follows:
mean = Sum of all observations
number of observations
Consider these examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Ashish studies for 4 hours, 5 hours and 3 hours respectively on three
consecutive days. How many hours does he study daily on an average?
DATA HANDLING
SOLUTION
The average study time of Ashish would be
Total number of study hours
Number of days for which he studied  = 4
hours = 4 hours per day
Thus, we can say that Ashish studies for 4 hours daily on an average.
EXAMPLE 2 A batsman scored the following number of runs in six innings:
36, 35, 50, 46, 60, 55
Calculate the mean runs scored by him in an inning.
SOLUTION
Total runs = 36 + 35 + 50 + 46 + 60 + 55 = 282.
To find the mean, we find the sum of all the observations and divide it by the number of
observations.
Therefore, in this case, mean = 282
6  = 47. Thus, the mean runs scored in an inning are 47.
Where does the arithmetic mean lie
TRY THESE
How would you find the average of your study hours for the whole week?
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
Consider the data in the above examples and think on the following:
z Is the mean bigger than each of the observations?
z Is it smaller than each observation?
Discuss with your friends. Frame one more example of this type and answer the
same questions.
You will find that the mean lies inbetween the greatest and the smallest observations.
In particular, the mean of two numbers will always lie between the two numbers.
For example the mean of 5 and 11 is 5 11
, which lies between 5 and 11.
Can you use this idea to show that between any two fractional numbers, you can find
as many fractional numbers as you like. For example between 1
2  and 1
4  you have their
average
8  and then between 1
2  and 3
8 , you have their average 7
and so on.

MATHEMATICS
3.5.1  Range
The difference between the highest and the lowest observation gives us an idea of the
spread of the observations. This can be found by subtracting the lowest observation from
the highest observation. We call the result the range of the observation. Look at the
following example:
EXAMPLE 3 The ages in years of 10 teachers of a school are:
32, 41, 28, 54, 35, 26, 23, 33, 38, 40
(i) What is the age of the oldest teacher and that of the youngest teacher?
(ii) What is the range of the ages of the teachers?
(iii) What is the mean age of these teachers?
SOLUTION
(i) Arranging the ages in ascending order, we get:
23, 26, 28, 32, 33, 35, 38, 40, 41, 54
We find that the age of the oldest teacher is 54 years and the age of the youngest
teacher is 23 years.
(ii) Range of the ages of the teachers = (54 – 23) years = 31 years

MATHEMATICS
3.6  MODE
As we have said Mean is not the only measure of central tendency or the only form of
representative value. For different requirements from a data, other measures of central
tendencies are used.
Look at the following example
To find out the weekly demand for different sizes of shirt, a shopkeeper kept records of sales
of sizes 90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 105 cm, 110 cm. Following is the record for a week:
Size (in inches)
90 cm
95 cm
100 cm
105 cm
110 cm
Total
Number of Shirts Sold
If he found the mean number of shirts sold, do you think that he would be able to
decide which shirt sizes to keep in stock?
Mean of total shirts sold =
Total number of shirts sold
Number of different sizes of shirts =
Should he obtain 21 shirts of each size? If he does so, will he be able to cater to the
needs of the customers?
The shopkeeper, on looking at the record, decides to procure shirts of sizes 95 cm,
100 cm, 105 cm. He decided to postpone the procurement of the shirts of other sizes
because of their small number of buyers.
Look at another example
The owner of a readymade dress shop says, “The most popular size of dress I sell is the
size 90 cm.
Observe that here also, the owner is concerned about the number
of shirts of different sizes sold. She is however looking at the shirt size
that is sold the most. This is another representative value for the data.
The highest occuring event is the sale of size 90 cm.This representative
value is called the mode of the data.
The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs
most often.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the mode of the given set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4
SOLUTION
Arranging the numbers with same values together, we get
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4
Mode of this data is 2 because it occurs more frequently than other observations.
3.6.1  Mode of Large Data
Putting the same observations together and counting them is not easy if the number of
observations is large. In such cases we tabulate the data. Tabulation can begin by putting
tally marks and finding the frequency, as you did in your previous class.
DATA HANDLING
Look at the following example:
EXAMPLE 5 Following are the margins of victory in the football
matches of a league.
1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2,
6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2
Find the mode of this data.
SOLUTION
Let us put the data  in a tabular form:
Margins of Victory
Tally Bars
Number of Matches
Total
Looking at the table, we can quickly say that 2 is the ‘mode’ since 2 has occured the
highest number of times. Thus, most of the matches have been won with a victory margin
of 2 goals.
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
Can a set of numbers have more than one mode?
EXAMPLE 6 Find the mode of the numbers:  2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8
SOLUTION
Here, 2 and 5 both occur three times. Therefore, they both are modes of
the data.
1. Record the age in years of all your classmates. Tabulate the data and find the mode.
2. Record the heights in centimetres of your classmates and find the mode.
Find the mode of the following data:
12, 14, 12, 16, 15, 13, 14, 18, 19, 12, 14, 15, 16, 15, 16, 16, 15,
17, 13, 16, 16, 15, 15, 13, 15, 17, 15, 14, 15, 13, 15, 14
Find the mode of
(i) 2, 6, 5, 3, 0, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5,
2, 4,
(ii) 2, 14, 16, 12, 14, 14, 16,

2. Heights (in cm) of 25 children are given below:
168, 165, 163, 160, 163, 161, 162, 164, 163,  162, 164, 163, 160, 163, 160,
165, 163, 162, 163, 164, 163, 160, 165, 163, 162
What is the mode of their heights?  What do we understand by mode here?
Whereas mean gives us the average of all observations of the data, the mode gives that
observation which occurs most frequently in the data.
Let us consider the following examples:
(a) You have to decide upon the number of chapattis needed for 25 people called for a
feast.
(b) A shopkeeper selling shirts has decided to replenish her stock.
(c) We need to find the height of the door needed in our house.
(d) When going on a picnic, if only one fruit can be bought for everyone, which is the
fruit that we would get.
In which of these situations can we use the mode as a good estimate?
Consider the first statement. Suppose the number of chapattis needed by each person
is    2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5
The mode of the data is 2 chapattis. If we use mode as the representative value for this
data, then we need 50 chapattis only, 2 for each of the 25 persons. However the total
number would clearly be inadequate. Would mean be an appropriate representative value?
For the third statement the height of the door is related to the height of the persons
using that door. Suppose there are 5 children and 4 adults using the door and the height
of each of 5 children is around 135 cm. The mode for the heights is
135 cm. Should we get a door that is 144 cm high? Would all the
adults be able to go through that door? It is clear that mode is not the
appropriate representative value for this data. Would mean be an
appropriate representative value here?
Why not? Which representative value of height should be used to
decide the doorheight?
Similarly analyse the rest of the statements and find the representative
value useful for that issue.
Discuss with your friends and give
(a) Two situations where mean would be an appropriate representative value to
use, and
(b) Two situations where mode would be  an appropriate representative value to use.

DATA HANDLING
3.7  MEDIAN
We have seen that in some situations, arithmetic mean is an appropriate measure of central
tendency whereas in some other situations, mode is the appropriate measure of central
tendency.
Let us now look at another example. Consider a group of 17 students with the following
heights (in cm): 106, 110, 123, 125, 117, 120, 112, 115, 110, 120, 115, 102, 115, 115,
109, 115, 101.
The games teacher wants to divide the class into two groups so that each group has
equal number of students, one group has students with height lesser than a particular height
and the other group has students with heights greater than the particular height. How
would she do that?
Let us see the various options she has:
(i) She can find the mean. The mean is
Your friend found the median and the
mode of a given data. Describe and
correct your friends error if any:
35, 32, 35, 42, 38, 32, 34
Median = 42, Mode = 32
TRY THESE
113 5.
123 125 117
115 110
115 102
115 115 10
115 101
So, if the teacher divides the students into two groups on the basis of this mean height,
such that one group has students of height less than the mean height and the other group
has students with height more than the mean height, then the groups would be of unequal
size. They would have 7 and 10 members respectively.
(ii) The second option for her is to find mode. The observation with highest frequency is
115 cm, which would be taken as mode.
There are 7 children below the mode and 10 children at the mode and above the
mode. Therefore, we cannot divide the group into equal parts.
Let us therefore think of an alternative representative value or measure of central
tendency. For doing this we again look at the given heights (in cm) of students and arrange
them in ascending order. We have the following observations:
101, 102, 106, 109, 110, 110, 112, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 117, 120, 120, 123, 125
The middle value in this data is 115 because this value divides the students into two
equal groups of 8 students each. This value is called as Median. Median refers to the
value which lies in the middle of the data (when arranged in an
increasing or decreasing order) with half of the observations
above it and the other half below it. The games teacher decides
to keep the middle student as a refree in the game.
Here, we consider only those cases where number of
observations is odd.
Thus, in a given data, arranged in ascending or descending
order, the median gives us the middle observation.
MATHEMATICS
Note that in general, we may not get the same value for median and mode.
Thus we realise that mean, mode and median are the numbers that are the representative
values of a group of observations or data. They lie between the minimum and maximum
values of the data. They are also called the measures of the central tendency.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the median of the data: 24, 36, 46, 17, 18, 25, 35
SOLUTION
We arrange the data in ascending order, we get 17, 18, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46
Median is the middle observation. Therefore 25 is the median.
EXERCISE 3.2
1. The scores in mathematics test (out of 25) of 15 students is as follows:

Find the mode and median of this data. Are they same?
2. The runs scored in a cricket match by 11 players is as follows:

3. The weights (in kg.) of 15 students of a class are:

(ii) The mean is one of the numbers in a data.
(iii) The median is always one of the numbers in a data.
(iv) The data 6, 4, 3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 9 has mean 9.
3.8  USE OF BAR GRAPHS WITH A DIFFERENT PURPOSE
We have seen last year how information collected could be first arranged in a frequency
distribution table and then this information could be put as a visual representation in the
form of pictographs or bar graphs. You can look at the bar graphs and make deductions
about the data. You can also get information based on these bar graphs. For example, you
can say that the mode is the longest bar if the bar represents the frequency.
3.8.1 Choosing a Scale
We know that a bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform width and
the lengths of the bars depend upon the frequency and the scale you have chosen. For
example, in a bar graph where numbers in units are to be shown, the graph represents one
unit length for one observation and if it has to show numbers in tens or hundreds, one unit
length can represent 10 or 100 observations. Consider the following examples:
DATA HANDLING
EXAMPLE 8 Two hundred students of 6th and 7th classes were asked to name their
favourite colour so as to decide upon what should be the colour of their
school building. The results are shown in the following table. Represent
the given data on a bar graph.
Favourite Colour
Green
Yellow
Orange
Number of Students
Answer the following questions with the help of the bar graph:
(i) Which is the most preferred colour and which is the least preferred?
(ii) How many colours are there in all? What are they?
SOLUTION
Choose a suitable scale as
follows:
Start the scale at 0. The greatest value in the
data is 55, so end the scale at a value greater
than 55, such as 60. Use equal divisions along
the axes, such as increments of 10. You know
that all the bars would lie between 0 and 60.
We choose the scale such that the length
between 0 and 60 is neither too long nor too
small. Here we take 1 unit for 10 students.
We then draw and label the graph as shown.
From the bar graph we conclude that
(i) Blue is the most preferred colour (Because the bar representing Blue is the tallest).
(ii) Green is the least preferred colour. (Because the bar representing Green is the
shortest).
(iii) There are five colours. They are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Orange. (These are
observed on the horizontal line)
EXAMPLE 9 Following data gives total marks (out of 600) obtained by six children of
a particular class. Represent the data on a bar graph.
Students
Dipti
Faiyaz
Geetika
Marks Obtained
SOLUTION
(i) To choose an appropriate scale we make equal divisions taking increments of 100.
Thus 1 unit will represent 100 marks. (What would be the difficulty if we choose one
unit to represent 10 marks?)
MATHEMATICS
(ii) Now represent the data on the bar graph.
Drawing double bar graph
Consider the following two collections of data giving the average daily hours of sunshine in
two cities Aberdeen and Margate for all the twelve months of the year. These cities are
near the south pole and hence have only a few hours of sunshine each day.
In Margate
Jan. Feb. Mar. April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.
Average
hours of
Sunshine
In Aberdeen
Average
hours of
Sunshine
By drawing individual bar graphs you could answer questions like
(i) In which month does each city has maximum sunlight?    or
(ii) In which months does each city has minimum sunlight?
However, to answer questions like “In a particular month, which city has more sunshine
hours”, we need to compare the average hours of sunshine of both the cities. To do this we
will learn to draw what is called a double bar graph giving the information of both cities
side-by-side.
This bar graph (Fig 3.1) shows the average sunshine of both the cities.
For each month we have two bars, the heights of which give the average hours of
sunshine in each city. From this we can infer that except for the month of April, there is
always more sunshine in Margate than in Aberdeen. You could put together a similiar bar
graph for your area or for your city.
DATA HANDLING
Let us look at another example more related to us.
EXAMPLE 10 A mathematics teacher wants to see, whether the new technique of

3.9  CHANCE AND PROBABILITY
These words often come up in our daily life. We often say, “there is no chance of it
raining today” and also say things like “it is quite probable that India will win the
World Cup.” Let us try and understand these terms a bit more. Consider the
statements;
(i) The Sun coming up from the West
An ant growing to 3 m height.
(iii) If you take a cube of larger volume its side will also be larger.
(iv) If you take a circle with larger area then it’s radius will also be larger.
(v) India winning the next test series.
If we look at the statements given above you would say that the Sun coming up from
the West is impossible, an ant growing to 3 m  is also not possible. On the other hand if
the circle is of a larger area it is certain that it will have a larger radius. You can say the same
about the larger volume of  the cube and the larger side. On the other hand India can win
the next test series or lose it. Both are possible.
3.9.1  Chance
If you toss a coin, can you always correctly predict what you will get? Try tossing
a coin and predicting the outcome each time. Write your observations in the
following table:
Toss Number
Prediction
Outcome
Do this 10 times. Look at the observed outcomes. Can you see a pattern in them?
What do you get after each head? Is it that you get head all the time? Repeat the observation
for another 10 tosses and write the observations in the table.
You will find that the observations show no clear pattern. In the table below we give
you observations generated in 25 tosses by Sushila and Salma. Here H represents Head
and T represents Tail.
Numbers
10 11 12 13 14 15
Outcome
Numbers 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
Outcome
What does this data tell you? Can you find a predictable pattern for head and tail?
Clearly there is no fixed pattern of occurrence of head and tail. When you throw the coin
each time the outcome of every throw can be either head or tail. It is a matter of chance
that in one particular throw you get either of these.
In the above data, count the number of heads and the number of tails. Throw the coin
some more times and keep recording what you obtain. Find out the total number of times
you get a head and the total number of times you get a tail.
You also might have played with a die. The die has six faces. When you throw a die,
can you predict the number that will be obtained? While playing ludo or snake and ladders
you may have often wished that in a throw you get a particular outcome.
Think of some
situations,
atleast 3
examples of

certain to
happen, some
that are

some that may
or may not
happen i.e.,

times and fill the data in the following table:

Make a tally mark each time you get the outcome, against the appropriate number.
For example in the first throw you get 5. Put a tally in front of 5. The next throw gives
you 1. Make a tally for 1. Keep on putting tally marks for the appropriate number.
Repeat this exercise for 150 throws and find out the number of each outcome for 150
throws.

Number on the Die
Tally Marks
3. Throw a die 100 times and record the data. Find the number of times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

What is probability?
We know that when a coin is thrown, it has two possible outcomes, Head  or Tail and for
a die we have 6 possible outcomes. We also know from experience that for a coin, Head
or Tail is equally likely to be obtained. We say that the probability of getting Head or Tail
is equal and is 1
2  for each.
For a die, possibility of getting either of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 is equal. That is for a die
there are 6 equally likely possible outcomes. We say each of  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 has
one-sixth ( 1
6 ) probability. We will learn about this in the later classes. But from what we
TRY THESE
MATHEMATICS
have done, it may perhaps be obvious that events that have many possibilities can
have probability between 0 and 1. Those which have no chance of happening have
probability 0 and those that are bound to happen have probability 1.
Given any situation we need to understand the different possible outcomes
and study the possible chances for each outcome. It may be possible that the
outcomes may not have equal chance of occuring unlike the cases of the coin and
die. For example, if a container has 15 red balls and 9 white balls and if a ball is
pulled out without seeing, the chances of getting a red ball are much more. Can
you see why? How many times are the chances of getting a red ball than getting
a white ball, probabilities for both being between 0 and 1.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. The collection, recording and presentation of data help us organise our experiences
and draw inferences from them.
2. Before collecting data we need to know what we would use it for.
3. The data that is collected needs to be organised in a proper table, so that it becomes
easy to understand and interpret.
4. Average is a number that represents or shows the central tendency of a group of
observations or data.
5. Arithmetic mean is one of the representative values of data.
6. Mode is another form of central tendency or representative value. The mode of a set
of observations is the observation that occurs most often.
7. Median is also a form of representative value. It refers to the value which lies in the
middle of the data with half of the observations above it and the other half below it.
8. A bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform widths.
9. Double bar graphs help to compare two collections of data at a glance.

SIMPLE EQUATIONS
4.1 A MIND-READING GAME!
The teacher has said that she would be starting a new chapter in
mathematics and it is going to be simple equations. Appu, Sarita
and Ameena have revised what they learnt in algebra chapter in
Class VI. Have you? Appu, Sarita and Ameena are excited because
they have constructed a game which they call mind reader and they
want to present it to the whole class.
The teacher appreciates their enthusiasm and invites them to present their game. Ameena
begins; she asks Sara to think of a number, multiply it by 4 and add 5 to the product. Then,
she asks Sara to tell the result. She says it is 65. Ameena instantly declares that the number
Sara had thought of is 15. Sara nods. The whole class including Sara is surprised.
It is Appu’s turn now. He asks Balu to think of a number, multiply it by 10 and subtract
20 from the product. He then asks Balu what his result is? Balu says it is 50. Appu
immediately tells the number thought by Balu. It is 7,  Balu confirms it.
Everybody wants to know how the ‘mind reader’ presented by Appu, Sarita and
Ameena works. Can you see how it works? After studying this chapter and chapter 12,

Let us take Ameena’s example. Ameena asks Sara to think of a number. Ameena does not
know the number. For her, it could be anything 1, 2, 3, . . ., 11, . . . , 100, . . . . Let us
denote this unknown number by a letter, say x. You may use y or t or some other letter in
place of x. It does not matter which letter we use to denote the unknown number Sara has
thought of. When Sara multiplies the number by 4, she gets 4x. She then adds 5 to the
product, which gives 4x + 5. The value of (4x + 5) depends on the value of x. Thus
if x = 1, 4x + 5 = 4 ×1 + 5 = 9. This means that if Sara had 1 in her mind, her result would
have been 9. Similarly, if she thought of 5, then for x  = 5, 4x + 5 = 4 × 5 + 5 = 25; Thus
if Sara had chosen 5, the result would have been 25.

Equations
MATHEMATICS
To find the number thought by Sara let us work backward from her answer 65. We
have to find x such that
4x + 5 = 65
(4.1)
Solution to the equation will give us the number which Sara held in her mind.
Let us similarly look at Appu’s example. Let us call the number Balu chose as y. Appu
asks Balu to multiply the number by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. That is, from y,
Balu first gets 10y and from there (10y – 20). The result is known to be 50.
Therefore,
10y – 20 = 50
(4.2)
The solution of this equation will give us the number Balu had thought of.
4.3  REVIEW OF WHAT WE KNOW
Note, (4.1) and (4.2) are equations. Let us recall what we learnt about equations in
Class VI. An equation is a condition on a variable. In equation (4.1), the variable is x;
in equation (4.2), the variable is y.
The word variable means something that can vary, i.e. change. A variable takes on
different numerical values; its value is not fixed. Variables are denoted usually by
letters of the alphabets, such as x, y, z, l, m, n, p, etc. From variables, we form
expressions. The expressions are formed by performing operations like addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division on the variables. From x, we formed the expression (4x + 5).
For this, first we multiplied x by 4 and then added 5 to the product. Similarly, from y, we
formed the expression (10y – 20). For this, we multiplied y by 10 and then subtracted 20
from the product. All these are examples of expressions.
The value of an expression thus formed depends upon the chosen value of the variable.
As we have already seen, when x = 1, 4x + 5 = 9; when x = 5, 4x + 5 = 25. Similarly,
x = 15,  4 x + 5 = 4×15 + 5 = 65;
x = 0,  4 x + 5 = 4 × 0 + 5 = 5; and so on.
Equation (4.1) is a condition on the variable x. It states that the value of the expression
(4x + 5) is 65. The condition is satisfied when x = 15. It is the solution to the equation
4x + 5 = 65. When x = 5, 4x + 5 = 25 and not 65. Thus x = 5 is not a solution to the
equation. Similarly, x = 0 is not a solution to the equation. No value of x other than 15
satisfies the condition 4x + 5 = 65.
The value of the expression (10y – 20) depends on the value of y. Verify this by
giving five different values to y and finding for each y the value of (10 y – 20). From
the different values of (10y – 20) you obtain, do you see a solution to 10y – 20 = 50?
If there is no solution, try giving more values to y and find whether the condition
10y – 20 = 50 is met.

SIMPLE EQUATIONS
4.4  WHAT EQUATION IS?
In an equation there is always an equality sign. The equality sign shows that the value of
the expression to the left of the sign (the left hand side or LHS) is equal to
the value of the expression to the right of the sign (the right hand side or RHS). In
equation (4.1), the LHS is (4x + 5) and the RHS is 65. In equation (4.2), the LHS is
(10y – 20) and the RHS is 50.
If there is some sign other than the equality sign between the LHS and the RHS, it is
not an equation. Thus, 4x + 5 > 65 is not an equation.
It says that, the value of (4x + 5) is greater than 65.
Similarly,  4x + 5 < 65 is not an equation. It says that the value of (4x + 5) is smaller
than 65.
In equations, we often find that the RHS is just a number. In Equation (4.1), it is 65
and in equation (4.2), it is 50. But this need not be always so. The RHS of an equation may
be an expression containing the variable. For example, the equation
4x + 5 = 6x – 25
has the expression (4x + 5) on the left and (6x – 25) on the right of the equality sign.
In short, an equation is a condition on a variable. The condition is that two
expressions should have equal value. Note that at least one of the two expressions
must contain the variable.
We also note a simple and useful property of equations. The equation 4x +5 = 65 is
the same as 65 = 4x + 5. Similarly, the equation 6x – 25 = 4x +5 is the same as
4x + 5 = 6x – 25. An equation remains the same, when the expressions on the left
and on the right are interchanged. This property is often useful in solving equations.
EXAMPLE 1 Write the following statements in the form of equations:
(i) The sum of three times x and 11 is 32.
(ii) If you subtract 5 from 6 times a number, you get 7.
(iii) One fourth of m is 3 more than 7.
(iv) One third of a number plus 5 is 8.
SOLUTION
(i) Three times x is 3x.
Sum of 3x and 11 is 3x + 11. The sum is 32.
The equation is 3x + 11 = 32.
(ii) Let us say the number is z; z multiplied by 6 is 6z.
Subtracting 5 from 6z, one gets 6z – 5. The result is 7.
The equation is 6z – 5 = 7
MATHEMATICS
(iii) One fourth of m is m
It is greater than 7 by 3. This means the difference ( m
4 – 7) is 3.
The equation is m
4 – 7 = 3.
(iv) Take the number to be n. One third of n is n
This one-third plus 5 is n
3  + 5. It is 8.
The equation is n
3  + 5 = 8.
EXAMPLE 2 Convert the following equations in statement form:
(i) x – 5 = 9
(ii) 5p = 20
(iii) 3n + 7 = 1
5  – 2 = 6
SOLUTION
(i) Taking away 5 from x gives 9.
(ii) Five times a number p is 20.
(iii) Add 7 to three times n to get 1.
(iv) You get 6, when you subtract 2 from one-fifth of a number m.
What is important to note is that for a given equation, not just one, but many statement
forms can be given. For example, for Equation (i) above, you can say:
Subtract 5 from x, you get 9.
The number x is 5 more than 9.
The number x is greater by 5 than 9.
The difference between x and 5 is 9, and so on.
EXAMPLE 3 Consider the following situation:
Raju’s father’s age is 5 years more than three times Raju’s age. Raju’s father is 44 years
old. Set up an equation to find Raju’s age.
SOLUTION
We do not know Raju’s age. Let us take it to be y years. Three times
Raju’s age is 3y years. Raju’s father’s age is 5 years more than 3y; that
is, Raju’s father is (3y + 5) years old. It is also given that Raju’s father
is 44 years old.
Therefore,
3y + 5 = 44
(4.3)
This is an equation in y. It will give Raju’s age when solved.
EXAMPLE 4 A shopkeeper sells mangoes in two types of boxes, one small and one
large. A large box contains as many as 8 small boxes plus 4 loose mangoes.
Set up an equation which gives the number of mangoes in each small box.
The number of mangoes in a large box is given to be 100.
SOLUTION
Let a small box contain m mangoes. A large box contains 4 more than 8
times m, that is, 8m + 4 mangoes. But this is given to be 100. Thus
8m + 4 = 100
(4.4)
You can get the number of mangoes in a small box by solving this equation.
Write atleast one other form for
each equation (ii), (iii) and (iv).

4.4.1  Solving an Equation
Consider an equality
8 – 3 = 4 + 1
(4.5)
The equality (4.5) holds, since both its sides are equal (each is equal to 5).
z Let us now add 2 to both sides; as a result
LHS = 8 – 3 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
RHS = 4 + 1 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.
Again the equality holds (i.e., its LHS and RHS are equal).
Thus if we add the same number to both sides of an equality, it still holds.
z Let us now subtract 2 from both the sides; as a result,
LHS = 8  – 3 – 2 = 5 – 2 = 3
RHS = 4 + 1 – 2 = 5 – 2 = 3.
Again, the equality holds.
Thus if we subtract the same number from both sides of an equality, it still holds.
z Similarly, if we multiply or divide both sides of the equality by the same non-zero
number, it still holds.
For example, let us multiply both the sides of the equality by 3, we get
LHS = 3 × (8 – 3) = 3 × 5 = 15, RHS = 3 × (4 + 1) = 3 × 5 = 15.
The equality holds.
Let us now divide both sides of the equality by 2.
LHS = (8 – 3) ÷ 2 = 5 ÷ 2 = 5
RHS = (4+1) ÷ 2 = 5 ÷ 2 = 5
2  = LHS
Again, the equality holds.
If we take any other equality, we shall find the same conclusions.
Suppose, we do not observe these rules. Specificially, suppose we add different
numbers, to the two sides of an equality. We shall find in this case that the equality does not
SIMPLE EQUATIONS
hold (i.e., its both sides are not equal). For example, let us take again equality (4.5),
8 – 3 = 4 + 1
add 2 to the LHS and 3 to the RHS. The new LHS is 8 – 3 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 and the new
RHS is 4 + 1 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8. The equality does not hold, because the new LHS and RHS
are not equal.
Thus if we fail to do the same mathematical operation on both sides of an equality,
the equality does not hold.
The equality that involves variables is an equation.
These conclusions are also valid for equations, as in each equation variable
represents a number only.
Often an equation is said to be like a weighing balance. Doing a mathematical operation
on an equation is like adding weights to or removing weights from the pans of a weighing
balance.
An equation is like a weighing balance with equal weights on
both its pans, in which case the arm of the balance is exactly
horizontal. If we add the same weights to both the pans, the arm
remains horizontal. Similarly, if we remove the same weights from
both the pans, the arm remains horizontal. On the other hand if we
add different weights to the pans or remove different weights from
them, the balance is tilted; that is, the arm of the balance does not
remain horizontal.
We use this principle for solving an equation. Here, ofcourse,
the balance is imaginary and numbers can be used as weights that can be physically
balanced against each other. This is the real purpose in presenting the principle. Let us
take some examples.
z Consider the equation:     x + 3 = 8
(4.6)
We shall subtract 3 from both sides of this equation.
The new LHS is
x + 3 – 3 = x
the new RHS is
8 – 3 = 5
Since this does not disturb the balance, we have
New LHS = New RHS or
x = 5
which is exactly what we want, the solution of the equation (4.6).
A balanced equation is like a
weighing balance with equal weights
in the two pans.
L.H.S.
R.H.S.
Why should we subtract 3,
and not some other
number? Try adding 3.
Will it help? Why not?
It is because subtracting 3
reduces the LHS to x.
MATHEMATICS
To confirm whether we are right, we shall put x = 5 in the original equation. We get
LHS = x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8, which is equal to the RHS as required.
By doing the right mathematical operation (i.e., subtracting 3) on both the sides of the
equation, we arrived at the solution of the equation.
z Let us look at another equation
x – 3 = 10
(4.7)
What should we do here? We should add 3 to both the sides, By doing so, we shall
retain the balance and also the LHS will reduce to just x.
New LHS = x – 3 + 3 = x  ,   New RHS = 10 + 3 = 13
Therefore, x = 13,  which is the required solution.
By putting x = 13 in the original equation (4.7) we confirm that
the solution is correct:
LHS of original equation = x – 3 = 13 – 3 = 10
This is equal to the RHS as required.
z Similarly, let us look at the equations
5y = 35
(4.8)
2  = 5
(4.9)
In the first case, we shall divide both the sides by 5. This will give us just y on LHS
New LHS = 5
New RHS = 35
Therefore,
y = 7
This is the required solution. We can substitute y = 7 in Eq. (4.8) and check that it is
satisfied.
In the second case, we shall multiply both sides by 2. This will give us just m on the
The new LHS =  m
= m. The new RHS = 5 × 2 = 10.
Hence, m = 10 (It is the required solution. You can check whether the solution is correct).
One can see that in the above examples, the operation we need to perform depends
on the equation. Our attempt should be to get the variable in the equation separated.
Sometimes, for doing so we may have to carry out more than one mathematical operation.
Let us solve some more equations with this in mind.
EXAMPLE 5 Solve: (a) 3n + 7 = 25
(4.10)
(b) 2p – 1 = 23
(4.11)
SOLUTION
(a) We go stepwise to separate the variable n on the LHS of the equation. The LHS is
3n + 7. We shall first subtract 7 from it so that we get 3n. From this, in the next step
we shall divide by 3 to get n. Remember we must do the same operation on both
sides of the equation. Therefore, subtracting 7 from both sides,
3n + 7 – 7 = 25 – 7
(Step 1)
3n = 18
SIMPLE EQUATIONS
Now divide both sides by 3,
n  = 18
(Step 2)
n = 6, which is the solution.
(b) What should we do here? First we shall add 1 to both the sides:
2p – 1 + 1 = 23 + 1
(Step 1)
2p = 24
Now divide both sides by 2, we get 2
(Step 2)
p = 12, which is the solution.
One good practice you should develop is to check the solution you have obtained.
Although we have not done this for (a) above, let us do it for this example.
Let us put the solution p = 12 back into the equation.
LHS = 2p – 1 = 2 × 12 – 1 = 24 – 1
= 23 = RHS
The solution is thus checked for its correctness.
Why do you not check the solution of (a) also?
We are now in a position to go back to the mind-reading game presented by Appu,
Sarita, and Ameena and understand how they got their answers. For this purpose, let us
look at the equations (4.1) and (4.2) which correspond respectively to Ameena’s and
Appu’s examples.
z First consider the equation 4x + 5 = 65.
(4.1)
Subtracting 5 from both sides,  4x + 5 – 5 = 65 – 5.
4x = 60
Divide both sides by 4; this will separate x. We get 4
x  = 60
x = 15, which is the solution. (Check, if it is correct.)
z Now consider,10y – 20 = 50
(4.2)
Adding 20 to both sides, we get 10y – 20 + 20 = 50 + 20  or  10y = 70
Dividing both sides by 10, we get
y  =  70
y = 7, which is the solution. (Check if it is correct.)
You will realise that exactly these were the answers given by Appu, Sarita and Ameena.
They had learnt to set up equations and solve them. That is why they could construct their
mind reader game and impress the whole class.  We shall come back to this in Section 4.7.

4.5 MORE EQUATIONS
Let us practise solving some more equations. While solving these equations, we shall learn
about transposing a number, i.e., moving it from one side to the other. We can transpose a
number instead of adding or subtracting it from both sides of the equation.
EXAMPLE 6 Solve:  12p – 5  = 25
(4.12)
SOLUTION
z Adding 5 on both sides of the equation,
12p – 5 + 5 = 25 + 5
12p = 30
z Dividing both sides by 12,
p = 5
Check  Putting p = 5
2  in the LHS of equation 4.12,
LHS =
= 6 × 5 – 5
= 30 – 5 = 25 = RHS
Note, adding 5 to both sides
is the same as changing side
of (– 5).
12p – 5 = 25
12p = 25 + 5
Changing side is called
transposing. While trans-
posing a number, we change
its sign.
SIMPLE EQUATIONS
As we have seen, while solving equations one commonly used operation is adding or
subtracting the same number on both sides of the equation. Transposing a number
(i.e., changing the side of the number) is the same as adding or subtracting the number
from both sides. In doing so, the sign of the number has to be changed. What applies to
numbers also applies to expressions. Let us take two more examples of transposing.
Adding or Subtracting
Transposing
on both sides
(i) 3p – 10 = 5
(i) 3p – 10 = 5
Add 10 to both sides
Transpose (–10) from LHS to RHS
3p – 10 + 10 = 5 + 10
(On transposing – 10 becomes + 10).
or 3p = 15
3p = 5 + 10   or   3p = 15
(ii) 5x + 12 = 27
(ii) 5x + 12 = 27
Subtract 12 from both sides
Transposing  + 12
(On transposing + 12 becomes – 12)
5x + 12 – 12 = 27 – 12
5x = 27 – 12
or 5x = 15
or  5x = 15
We shall now solve two more equations. As you can see they involve brackets, which
have to be solved before proceeding.
EXAMPLE 7 Solve
(a) 4(m + 3)  = 18
(b) – 2(x + 3) = 8
SOLUTION
(a) 4(m + 3)  = 18
Let us divide both the sides by 4. This will remove the brackets in the LHS We get,
m = 9
2 –3   (transposing 3 to RHS)
m = 3
2 (required solution) as 9
Check
LHS = 4 3
×  [put m = 3
= 6 + 12 = 18 = RHS
(b) –2(x + 3) = 8
We divide both sides by (– 2), so as to remove the brackets in the LHS, we get,
x + 3 = – 8
x + 3 = – 4
i.e., x = – 4 – 3
(transposing 3 to RHS)
x = –7
(required solution)
MATHEMATICS
Check
LHS =
–2 –7
–2 –4
= 8 = RHS    as required.

equation. He wonders why not follow the reverse path:

He follows the path given below:
Start with
x = 5
Multiply both sides by 4,
4x = 20
Divide both sides by 4.
Subtract 3 from both sides,
4x – 3 = 17
Add 3 to both sides.
This has resulted in an equation. If we follow the reverse path with each
step, as shown on the right, we get the solution of the equation.
Hetal feels interested. She starts with the same first step and builds up another
equation.
x = 5
Multiply both sides by 3
3x = 15
Add 4 to both sides
3x + 4 = 19
Start with y = 4 and make two different equations. Ask three of your friends to do the
same. Are their equations different from yours?
Is it not nice that not only can you solve an equation, but you can make
equations? Further, did you notice that given an equation, you get one solution;
but given a solution, you can make many equations?
Now, Sara wants the class to know what she is thinking. She says, “I shall take Hetal’s
equation and put it into a statement form and that makes a puzzle. For example, think of a
number; multiply it by 3 and add 4 to the product. Tell me the sum you get.
If the sum is 19, the equation Hetal got will give us the solution to the
puzzle. In fact, we know it is 5, because Hetal started with it.”
She turns to Appu, Ameena and Sarita to check whether they made
their puzzle this way. All three say, “Yes!”

4.7 APPLICATIONS OF SIMPLE EQUATIONS TO PRACTICAL
SITUATIONS
We have already seen examples in which we have taken statements in everyday language
and converted them into simple equations. We also have learnt how to solve simple equations.
Thus we are ready to solve puzzles/problems from practical situations. The method is first
to form equations corresponding to such situations and then to solve those equations
to give the solution to the puzzles/problems. We begin with what we have already seen
[Example 1 (i) and (iii), Section 4.2].
EXAMPLE 8 The sum of three times a number and 11 is 32. Find the number.
SOLUTION
z If the unknown number is taken to be x, then three times the number is 3x and the sum
of 3x and 11 is 32. That is,  3x + 11 = 32
z To solve this equation, we transpose 11 to RHS, so that
3x = 32 – 11    or     3x = 21
Now, divide both sides by 3
x = 21
3  = 7
This equation was obtained
earlier in Section 4.2, Example 1.
MATHEMATICS
The required number is 7. (We may check it by taking 3 times 7 and adding 11 to it.
It gives 32 as required.)
EXAMPLE 9 Find a number, such that one-fourth of the number is 3 more than 7.
SOLUTION
z Let us take the unknown number to be y; one-fourth of y is y
This number y
⎠⎟ is more than 7 by 3.
Hence we get the equation for y as y
4  – 7 = 3
To solve this equation, first transpose 7 to RHS We get,
4  = 3 + 7 = 10.
We then multiply both sides of the equation by 4, to get
4  × 4 = 10 × 4        or        y = 40
(the required number)
Let us check the equation formed. Putting the value of y in the equation,
LHS = 40
4  – 7 = 10 – 7 = 3 = RHS,    as required.
EXAMPLE 10 Raju’s father’s age is 5 years more than three times Raju’s age. Find
Raju’s age, if his father is 44 years old.
SOLUTION
z As given in Example 3 earlier, the equation that gives Raju's age is
3y + 5 = 44
z To solve it, we first transpose 5, to get
3y = 44 – 5 = 39
Dividing both sides by 3, we get
y = 13
That is, Raju’s age is 13 years. (You may check the answer.)

4. Solve the following riddle:

MATHEMATICS
WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. An equation is a condition on a variable such that two expressions in the variable
should have equal value.
2. The value of the variable for which the equation is satisfied is called the solution of the
equation.
3. An equation remains the same if the LHS and the RHS are interchanged.
4. In case of the balanced equation, if we
(i)  add the same number to both the sides, or  (ii)   subtract the same number from
both the sides, or (iii)  multiply both sides by the same number, or  (iv)  divide both
sides by the same number, the balance remains undisturbed, i.e., the value of the
LHS remains equal to the value of the RHS
5. The above property gives a systematic method of solving an equation. We carry out
a series of identical mathematical operations on the two sides of the equation in such
a way that on one of  the sides we get just the variable. The last step is the solution of
the equation.
6. Transposing means moving to the other side. Transposition of a number has the same
effect as adding same number to (or subtracting the same number from) both sides of
the equation. When you transpose a number from one side of the equation to the
other side, you change its sign. For example, transposing +3 from the LHS to the
RHS in equation x + 3 = 8 gives x = 8 – 3 (= 5). We can carry out the transposition
of an expression in the same way as the transposition of a number.
7. We have learnt how to construct simple algebraic expressions corresponding to
practical situations.
8. We also learnt how, using the technique of doing the same mathematical operation
(for  example adding the same number) on both sides, we could build an equation
starting from its  solution. Further, we also learnt that we could relate a given equation
to some appropriate  practical situation and build a practical word problem/puzzle
from the equation.
LINES AND ANGLES
5.1 INTRODUCTION
You already know how to identify different lines, line segments and angles in a given
shape. Can you identify the different line segments and angles formed in the following
figures? (Fig 5.1)
(iii)
Fig 5.1
Can you also identify whether the angles made are acute or obtuse or right?
Recall that a line segment has two end points. If we extend the two end points in either
direction endlessly, we get a line. Thus, we can say that a line has no end points. On the other
hand, recall that a ray has one end point (namely its starting point). For example, look at the
figures given below:
Fig 5.2
Here, Fig 5.2 (i) shows a line segment, Fig 5.2 (ii) shows a line and Fig 5.2 (iii) is that
of a ray. A line segment PQ is generally denoted by the symbol PQ, a line AB is denoted by
the symbol AB
and the ray OP is denoted by OP
. Give some examples of line segments and
rays from your daily life and discuss them with your friends.
Chapter  5
Lines and
Angles
(iii)
MATHEMATICS
Again recall that an angle is formed when lines or line segments meet. In Fig 5.1,
observe the corners. These corners are formed when two lines or line segments intersect
at a point. For example, look at the figures given below:
Fig 5.3
In Fig 5.3 (i) line segments AB and BC intersect at B to form angle ABC, and again
line segments BC and AC intersect at C to form angle ACB and so on. Whereas, in
Fig 5.3 (ii) lines PQ and RS intersect at O to form four angles POS,
SOQ, QOR and ROP. An angle ABC is represented by the symbol
∠ABC. Thus, in Fig 5.3 (i), the three angles formed are ∠ABC, ∠BCA
and ∠BAC, and in Fig 5.3 (ii), the four angles formed are ∠POS, ∠SOQ,
∠QOR and ∠POR. You have already studied how to classify the angles
as acute, obtuse or right angle.
Note: While referring to the measure of an angle ABC, we shall write m∠ABC as simply
∠ABC. The context will make it clear, whether we are referring to the angle or its measure.
5.2 RELATED ANGLES
5.2.1  Complementary Angles
When the sum of the measures of two angles is 90°, the angles are called complementary
angles.
List ten figures around you
and identify the acute, obtuse
and right angles found in them.

Whenever two angles are complementary, each angle is said to be the complement
of the other angle. In the above diagram (Fig 5.4), the ‘30° angle’ is the complement of the
‘60° angle’ and vice versa.

Do you notice that the sum of the measures of the angles in each of the above pairs

5.2.3.  Adjacent Angles
Look at the following figures:
Fig 5.8
At both the  vertices A and B, we find, a pair of angles are placed next to each other.
These angles are such that:
(i) they have a common vertex;
(ii) they have a common arm; and
(iii) the non-common arms are on either side of the common arm.
Such pairs of angles are called adjacent angles. Adjacent angles have a common
vertex and a common arm but no common interior points.
1. Are the angles marked 1 and 2 adjacent? (Fig 5.9). If they are not adjacent,
say, ‘why’.
When you open a book it looks like the above

A linear pair is a pair of adjacent angles whose non-common sides are opposite rays.
Are ∠1, ∠2 a linear pair? Yes
Are ∠1, ∠2 a linear pair? No! (Why?)
Fig 5.11
In Fig 5.11 (i) above, observe that the opposite rays (which are the non-common
sides of ∠1 and ∠2) form a line. Thus, ∠1 + ∠2 amounts to 180o.
The angles in a linear pair are supplementary.

Next take two pencils and tie them with the help of a rubber band at the middle as shown

Does ∠2 appear to be equal to ∠4?
Before checking this, let us see some real life examples for vertically opposite angles
(Fig 5.15).

Draw two lines l and m, intersecting at a point. You can now mark ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and

its copy, ... etc.
Fix a pin at the point of intersection. Rotate the copy by 180o. Do the lines coincide
again?
can be rotated to get
Fig 5.16
You find that ∠1 and ∠3 have interchanged their positions and so have ∠2 and ∠4.
This has been done without disturbing the position of the lines.
Thus, ∠1 = ∠3 and ∠2 = ∠4.

LINES AND ANGLES
We conclude that when two lines intersect, the vertically opposite angles so
formed are equal.
Let us try to prove this using Geometrical Idea.
Let us consider two lines l and m. (Fig 5.17)
We can arrive at this result through logical reasoning as follows:
Let l and m be two lines, which intersect at O,
making angles ∠1, ∠2, ∠3 and ∠4.
We want to prove that   ∠1  = ∠3   and   ∠2  = ∠4
Now, ∠1 = 180º  – ∠2 (Because ∠1, ∠2 form a linear pair, so, ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o)        (i)
Similarly, ∠3 = 180º – ∠2 (Since ∠2, ∠3 form a linear pair, so, ∠2 + ∠3 = 180o)    (ii)
Therfore, ∠1 = ∠3
[By (i) and (ii)]
Similarly, we can prove that ∠2 = ∠4, (Try it!)

You might have seen a road crossing two or more roads or a railway line crossing several

5.3.4 Transversal of Parallel Lines
Do you remember what parallel lines are? They are lines on a plane that do not meet
anywhere. Can you identify parallel lines in the following figures? (Fig 5.27)
Transversals of parallel lines give rise to quite interesting results.
Fig 5.27
LINES AND ANGLES
Take a ruled sheet of paper. Draw (in thick colour) two parallel lines l and m.
Draw a transversal t to the lines l and m. Label ∠1 and ∠2 as shown [Fig 5.28(i)].
Place a tracing paper over the figure drawn. Trace the lines l, m and t.
Slide the tracing paper along t, until l coincides with m.
You find that ∠1 on the traced figure coincides with ∠2 of the original figure.
In fact, you can see all the following results by similar tracing and sliding activity.
(i)   ∠1 =  ∠2
(ii)   ∠3 =  ∠4
(iii)   ∠5 =  ∠6
(iv)   ∠7 =  ∠8
DO THIS
This activity illustrates the following fact:
If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each pair of corresponding angles are
equal in measure.
We use this result to get another interesting result. Look at Fig 5.29.
When t cuts the parallel lines, l, m, we get, ∠3 = ∠7 (vertically opposite angles).
But ∠7 = ∠8 (corresponding angles). Therefore,  ∠3 = ∠8
Fig 5.28
(iii)
MATHEMATICS
You can similarly show that ∠1 = ∠6. Thus, we have
the following result :
If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, each
pair of alternate interior angles are equal.
This second result leads to another interesting
property. Again, from Fig 5.29.
∠3 + ∠1 = 180° (∠3 and ∠1 form a linear pair)
But ∠1 = ∠6 (A pair of alternate interior angles)
Therefore,  we can say that ∠3 + ∠6 = 180°.
Similarly,  ∠1 + ∠8 = 180°. Thus, we obtain the following result:
If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of interior angles on the same
side of the transversal are supplementary.
You can very easily remember these results if you can look for relevant ‘shapes’.
The F-shape stands for corresponding angles:
The Z - shape stands for alternate angles.

5.4  CHECKING FOR PARALLEL LINES
If two lines are parallel, then you know that a transversal gives rise to
pairs of equal corresponding angles, equal alternate interior angles
and interior angles on the same side of the transversal being
supplementary.
When two lines are given, is there any method to check if they are
parallel or not? You need this skill in many life-oriented situations.
A draftsman uses a carpenter’s square and a straight edge (ruler)
to draw these segments (Fig 5.30). He claims they are parallel. How?
Are you able to see that he has kept the corresponding angles to
be equal? (What is the transversal here?)
Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of
corresponding angles are equal, then the lines have to be parallel.
Look at the letter Z(Fig 5.31). The horizontal segments here are
parallel, because the alternate angles are equal.
When a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of alternate
interior angles are equal, the lines have to be parallel.
Fig 5.30
Fig 5.31
MATHEMATICS
Draw a line l (Fig 5.32).
Draw a line m, perpendicular to l. Again draw a line p,
such that p is perpendicular to m.
Thus, p is perpendicular to a perpendicular to l.
You find p || l. How? This is because you draw p such
that ∠1 + ∠2 = 180o.
Thus, when a transversal cuts two lines, such that pairs of interior angles on the
same side of the transversal are supplementary, the lines have to be parallel.

THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
6.1 INTRODUCTION
A triangle, you have seen, is a simple closed curve made of three line
segments. It has three vertices, three sides and three angles.
Here is ΔABC (Fig 6.1). It has
Sides:
AB, BC , CA
Angles:
∠BAC,  ∠ABC,  ∠BCA
Vertices:
A, B, C
The side opposite  to the vertex A is BC. Can you name the angle opposite to the side AB?

Now, let us try to explore something more about triangles.
6.2  MEDIANS OF A TRIANGLE
Given a line segment, you know how to find its perpendicular bisector by paper folding.
Cut out a triangle ABC from a piece of paper (Fig 6.3). Consider any one of its sides, say,
BC . By paper-folding, locate the perpendicular bisector of BC . The folded crease meets
BC  at D, its mid-point. Join AD .
Fig 6.3
The line segment AD, joining the mid-point of BC  to its opposite vertex A is called a
median of the triangle.
Consider the sidesAB  and CA  and find two more medians of the triangle.
A median connects a vertex of a triangle to the mid-point of the opposite side.
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
1. How many medians can a triangle have?
2. Does a median lie wholly in the interior of the triangle? (If you think that this is not
true, draw a figure to show such a case).

6.3  ALTITUDES OF A TRIANGLE
Make a triangular shaped cardboard ABC. Place it upright on a
table. How ‘tall’ is the triangle? The height is the distance from
vertex A (in the Fig 6.4) to the base BC .
From A to BC , you can think of many line segments (see the
next Fig 6.5). Which among them will represent its height?
The height is given by the line segment that starts from A,
comes straight down to BC , and is perpendicular to BC .
This line segment AL  is an altitude of the triangle.
An altitude has one end point at a vertex of the triangle and
the other on the line containing the opposite side. Through each
vertex, an altitude can be drawn.
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
1. How many altitudes can a triangle have?
2. Draw rough sketches of altitudes from A to BC  for the following triangles (Fig 6.6):
Acute-angled
Right-angled
Obtuse-angled

3. Will an altitude always lie in the interior of a triangle? If you think that this need not be
true, draw a rough sketch to show such a case.
4. Can you think of a triangle in which two altitudes of the triangle are two of its sides?
5. Can the altitude and median be same for a triangle?
(Hint: For Q.No.  4 and 5, investigate by drawing the altitudes for every type of triangle).
Take several cut-outs of
(i) an equilateral triangle
(ii) an isosceles triangle and
(iii) a scalene triangle.
Find their altitudes and medians. Do you find anything special about them? Discuss it
with your friends.

(b) In ΔPQR, PQ and PR are altitudes of the triangle.
(c) In ΔXYZ, YL is an altitude in the exterior of the triangle.
3. Verify by drawing a diagram if the median and altitude of an isosceles triangle can be
same.
6.4 EXTERIOR ANGLE OF A TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTY
1. Draw a triangle ABC and produce one of its sides,
say BC as shown in Fig 6.7. Observe the angle
ACD formed at the point C. This angle lies in the
exterior of ΔABC. We call it an exterior angle
of the ΔABC formed at vertex C.
Clearly ∠BCA is an adjacent angle to ∠ACD. The
remaining two angles of the triangle namely ∠A and ∠B are
called  the two interior opposite angles or the two remote
interior angles of  ∠ACD. Now cut out (or make trace copies of) ∠A and ∠B and
place them adjacent to each other as shown in Fig 6.8.
Do these two pieces together entirely cover ∠ACD?
Can you say that
m ∠ACD = m ∠A + m ∠B?
2. As done earlier, draw a triangle ABC and form an exterior angle ACD. Now take a
protractor and measure ∠ACD, ∠A
and ∠B.
Find the sum ∠A + ∠B and compare
it with the measure of ∠ACD. Do you
observe that ∠ACD is equal (or nearly
equal, if there is an error in
measurement) to ∠A + ∠B?
DO THIS

Fig 6.8
THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
You may repeat the two activities as mentioned by drawing some more triangles along
with their exterior angles. Every time, you will find that the exterior angle of a triangle is
equal to the sum of its two interior opposite angles.
A logical step-by-step argument can further confirm this fact.
An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of its interior opposite
angles.
Given: Consider ΔABC.
∠ACD is an exterior angle.
To Show: m∠ACD =  m∠A + m∠B
Through C draw CE, parallel to BA .
Justification
Steps
Reasons
(a) ∠1 = ∠x
BA CE
and AC is a transversal.
Therefore, alternate angles should be equal.
(b) ∠2 = ∠y
BA CE
and BD is a transversal.
Therefore, corresponding angles should be equal.
(c) ∠1 + ∠2 = ∠x + ∠y
(d) Now,  ∠x + ∠y = m ∠ACD
From Fig 6.9
Hence, ∠1 + ∠2 = ∠ACD
The above relation between an exterior angle and its two interior opposite angles is
referred to as the Exterior Angle Property of a triangle.

1. Exterior angles can be formed for a triangle in many ways. Three of them are shown
here (Fig 6.10)

6.5  ANGLE SUM PROPERTY OF A TRIANGLE
There is a remarkable property connecting the three angles of a triangle. You are going to
see this through the following four activities.
1. Draw a triangle. Cut on the three angles. Rearrange them as shown in Fig 6.13 (i), (ii).
The three angles now constitute one angle. This angle is a straight angle and so has
measure 180°.
Fig 6.13
Thus, the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
2. The same fact you can observe in a different way also. Take three copies of any
triangle, say ΔABC (Fig 6.14).
Fig 6.14
MATHEMATICS
Arrange them as in Fig 6.15.
What do you observe about ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3?
(Do you also see the ‘exterior angle
property’?)
3. Take a piece of paper and cut out a triangle, say, ΔABC (Fig 6.16).
Make the altitude AM by folding ΔABC such that it passes through A.
Fold now the three corners such that all the three vertices A, B and C touch at M.
(iii)
Fig 6.16
You find that all the three angles form together a straight angle. This again shows that
the sum of the measures of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
4. Draw any three triangles, say ΔABC, ΔPQR and ΔXYZ in your notebook.
Use your protractor and measure each of the angles of these triangles.
Tabulate your results
Name of Δ

m∠Z =
m∠X + m∠Y + m∠Z =
Allowing marginal errors in measurement, you will find that the last column always
gives 180° (or nearly 180°).
When perfect precision is possible, this will also show that the sum of the measures of
the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
You are now ready to give a formal justification of your assertion through logical
argument.
Statement The total measure of
the three angles of a
triangle is 180°.
To justify this let us use the exterior
angle property of a triangle.
Fig 6.17
Fig 6.15
THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
Given
∠1, ∠2, ∠3 are angles of ΔABC (Fig 6.17).
∠4 is the exterior angle when BC is extended to D.
Justification
∠1 +  ∠2 = ∠4 (by exterior angle property)
∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = ∠4 + ∠3 (adding ∠3 to both the sides)
But ∠4 and ∠3 form a linear pair so it is 180°. Therefore, ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180°.
Let us see how we can use this property in a number of ways.
EXAMPLE 2 In the given figure (Fig 6.18) find m∠P.
SOLUTION By angle sum property of a triangle,
m∠P + 47° + 52° = 180°
Therefore
m∠P = 180° – 47° – 52°
= 180° – 99° = 81°

6.6 TWO SPECIAL TRIANGLES : EQUILATERAL AND ISOSCELES
A triangle in which all the three sides are of equal lengths is called an equilateral
triangle.
Take two copies of an equilateral triangle ABC (Fig 6.19). Keep one of them fixed.
Place the second triangle on it. It fits exactly into the first. Turn it round in any way and still
they fit with one another exactly. Are you
able to see that when the three sides of a
triangle have equal lengths then the three
angles are also of the same size?
We conclude that in an equilateral triangle:
(i) all sides have same length.
(ii) each angle has measure 60°.
TRY THESE
Fig 6.19
THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
A triangle in which two sides are of equal lengths is called an isosceles triangle.
Fig 6.20
From a piece of paper cut out an isosceles triangle XYZ, with XY=XZ (Fig 6.20).
Fold it such that Z lies on Y. The line XM through X is now the axis of symmetry (which
you will read in Chapter 14). You find that  ∠Y and  ∠Z fit on each other exactly. XY and
XZ are called equal sides;  YZ is called the base; ∠Y and  ∠Z are called base angles and
these are also equal.
Thus, in an isosceles triangle:
(i) two sides have same length.
(ii) base angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.

6.7  SUM OF THE LENGTHS OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE
1.Mark three non-collinear spots A, B and C in your playground. Using lime powder
mark the paths AB, BC and AC.
Ask your friend to start from A and reach C, walking along one or
more of these paths. She can, for example, walk first along AB and then
along BC  to reach C; or she can walk straight along AC. She will naturally
prefer the direct path AC. If she takes the other path  (ABand then BC ),
she will have to walk more. In other words,
AB + BC > AC
Similarly, if one were to start from B and go to A, he or she will not take the route
BC  and CA  but will prefer BA  This is because
BC + CA > AB
By a similar argument, you find that
CA + AB > BC
(iii)
These observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a
triangle is greater than the third side.
2. Collect fifteen small sticks (or strips) of different lengths, say, 6 cm, 7 cm, 8 cm,
9 cm, ..., 20 cm.
Take any three of these sticks and try to form a triangle. Repeat this by choosing
different combinations of three sticks.
Suppose you first choose two sticks of length 6 cm and 12 cm. Your third stick has to
be of length more than 12 – 6 = 6 cm and less than 12 + 6 = 18 cm. Try this and find
out why it is so.
To form a triangle you will need any three sticks such that the sum of the lengths of
any two of them will always be greater than the length of the third stick.
This also suggests that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater
than the third side.

THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
3. Draw any three triangles, say ΔABC, ΔPQR and ΔXYZ in your notebook
(Fig 6.22).

Use your ruler to find the lengths of their sides and then tabulate your results as follows:

(Yes/No)
___ + ___ > ___
This also strengthens our earlier guess. Therefore, we conclude that sum of the lengths
of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.
We also find that the difference between the length of any two sides of a triangle is
smaller than the length of the third side.
MATHEMATICS
EXAMPLE 3 Is there a triangle whose sides have lengths 10.2 cm, 5.8 cm and 4.5 cm?
SOLUTION
Suppose such a triangle is possible. Then the sum of the lengths of any two
sides would be greater than the length of the third side. Let us check this.
Is 4.5 + 5.8 >10.2?
Is 5.8 + 10.2 > 4.5?
Is 10.2 + 4.5 > 5.8?
Therefore, the triangle is possible.
EXAMPLE 4 The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 6 cm and 8 cm. Between which
two numbers can length of the third side fall?
SOLUTION
We know that the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than
the third.
Therefore, third side has to be less than the sum of the two sides. The third side is thus,
less than 8 + 6 = 14 cm.
The side cannot be less than the difference of the two sides. Thus, the third side has to
be more than 8 – 6 = 2 cm.
The length of the third side could be any length greater than 2 and less than 14 cm.

6.8  RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES AND PYTHAGORAS PROPERTY
Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher of sixth century
B.C. is said to have found a very important and useful
property of right-angled triangles given in this section.
The property is, hence, named after him. In fact, this
property was known to people of many other
countries too. The Indian mathematician Baudhayan
has also given an equivalent form of this property.
We now try to explain the Pythagoras property.
In a right-angled triangle, the sides have some
special names. The side opposite to the right angle
is called the hypotenuse; the other two sides are
known as the legs of the right-angled triangle.
In ΔABC (Fig 6.23), the right-angle is at B. So,
AC is the hypotenuse. AB and BC  are the legs of
ΔABC.
Make eight identical copies of right angled
triangle of any size you prefer. For example, you
make a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is a
units long and the legs are of lengths b units and
c units (Fig 6.24).
Draw two identical squares on a sheet with sides
of lengths b + c.
You are to place four triangles in one square and the remaining four triangles in the
other square, as shown in the following diagram (Fig 6.25).
Square A
Square B
Fig 6.23
Fig 6.24
Fig 6.25
MATHEMATICS
The squares are identical; the eight triangles inserted are also identical.
Hence the uncovered area of square A = Uncovered area of square B.
i.e., Area of inner square of square A = The total area of two uncovered squares in square B.
a2 = b2 + c2
This is Pythagoras property. It may be stated as follows:
In a right-angled triangle,
the square on the hypotenuse = sum of the squares on the legs.
Pythagoras property is a very useful tool in mathematics. It is formally proved as a
theorem in later classes. You should be clear about its meaning.
It says that for any right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is
equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs.
Draw a right triangle, preferably on
a square sheet, construct squares on
its sides, compute the area of these
squares and verify the theorem
practically (Fig 6.26).
If you have a right-angled triangle,
the Pythagoras property holds. If the
Pythagoras property holds for some
triangle, will the triangle be right-
angled? (Such problems are known as
converse problems). We will try to
answer this. Now, we will show that,
if there is a triangle such that sum of
the squares on two of its sides is equal
to the square of the third side, it must
be a right-angled triangle.
1. Have cut-outs of squares with sides 4 cm,
5 cm, 6 cm long. Arrange to get a triangular
shape by placing the corners of the squares
suitably as shown in the figure (Fig 6.27).
Trace out the triangle formed. Measure each
angle of the triangle. You find that there is no
right angle at all.
In fact, in this case each angle will be acute! Note
that 42 + 52 ≠ 62, 52 + 62 ≠ 42 and 62 + 42 ≠ 52.
Fig 6.26
DO THIS
Fig 6.27
THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES
2. Repeat the above activity with squares whose sides have lengths 4 cm, 5 cm and
7 cm. You get an obtuse-angled triangle! Note that
42 + 52 ≠72 etc.
This shows that Pythagoras property holds if and only if the triangle is right-angled.
Hence we get this fact:
If  the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled.
EXAMPLE 5 Determine whether the triangle whose lengths of sides are 3 cm, 4 cm,
5 cm is a right-angled triangle.
SOLUTION
32 = 3 × 3 = 9; 42 = 4 × 4 = 16; 52 = 5 × 5 = 25
We find 32 + 42 = 52.
Therefore, the triangle is right-angled.
Note: In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse happens to be the longest side. In this
example, the side with length 5 cm is the hypotenuse.
EXAMPLE 6 Δ ABC is right-angled at C. If
AC = 5 cm and BC = 12 cm find
the length of AB.
SOLUTION
A rough figure will help us (Fig 6.28).
By Pythagoras property,
AB2 = AC2 + BC2
= 52 + 122  = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132
AB2 = 132.  So,   AB = 13
or the length of AB is 13 cm.
Note: To identify perfect squares, you may use prime factorisation technique.

procedure. Try to collect a few of them and draw charts explaining them.
WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. The six elements of a triangle are its three angles and the three sides.
2. The line segment joining a vertex of a triangle to the mid point of its opposite side is
called a median of the triangle.   A triangle has 3 medians.

The non-equal side of an isosceles triangle is called its base; the base angles of an
isosceles triangle have equal measure.

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the
third side.
The difference between the lengths of any two sides is smaller than the length of the
third side.

MATHEMATICS
This property is useful to know if it is possible to draw a triangle when the lengths of
the three sides are known.
10. In a right angled triangle, the side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse
and the other two sides are called its legs.
11. Pythagoras property:
In a right-angled triangle,
the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares on its legs.
If a triangle is not right-angled, this property does not hold good.  This property is
useful to decide whether a given triangle is right-angled or not.
CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
7.1  INTRODUCTION
You are now ready to learn a very important geometrical idea, Congruence. In particular,
you will study a lot about congruence of triangles.
To understand what congruence is, we turn to some activities.
Take two stamps (Fig 7.1) of same denomination. Place one stamp over
the other. What do you observe?
Fig 7.1
One stamp covers the other completely and exactly. This means that the two stamps are
of the same shape and same size. Such objects are said to be congruent. The two stamps
used by you are congruent to one another. Congruent objects are exact copies of one
another.
Can you, now, say if the following objects are congruent or not?
1. Shaving blades of the same company [Fig 7.2 (i)].
2. Sheets of the same letter-pad [Fig 7.2 (ii)].
3. Biscuits in the same packet [Fig 7.2 (iii)].
4. Toys made of the same mould. [Fig 7.2(iv)]

MATHEMATICS
The relation of two objects being congruent is called congruence. For the present,
we will deal with plane figures only, although congruence is a general idea applicable to
three-dimensional shapes also. We will try to learn a precise meaning of the congruence
of plane figures already known.
7.2  CONGRUENCE OF PLANE FIGURES
Look at the two figures given here (Fig 7.3). Are they congruent?
Fig 7.3
You can use the method of superposition. Take a trace-copy of one of them and place
it over the other. If the figures cover each other completely, they are congruent. Alternatively,
you may cut out one of them and place it over the other. Beware! You are not allowed to
bend, twist or stretch the figure that is cut out (or traced out).
In Fig 7.3, if figure F1 is congruent to figure F2 , we write F1 ≅ F2.
7.3  CONGRUENCE AMONG LINE SEGMENTS
When are two line segments congruent?  Observe the two pairs of line segments given
here (Fig 7.4).
Fig 7.4
Use the ‘trace-copy’ superposition method for the pair of line segments in [Fig 7.4(i)].
Copy CDand place it on AB. You find that CD covers AB, with C on A and D on B.
Hence, the line segments are congruent.   We write AB
Repeat this activity for the pair of line segments in [Fig 7.4(ii)]. What do you find?
They are not congruent.  How do you know it?  It is because the line segments do not
coincide when placed one over other.
You should have by now noticed that the pair of line segments in [Fig 7.4(i)] matched
with each other because they had same length; and this was not the case in [Fig 7.4(ii)].
If two line segments have the same (i.e., equal) length, they are congruent.  Also,
if two line segments are congruent, they have the same length.
CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
In view of the above fact, when two line segments are congruent, we sometimes just
say that the line segments are equal; and we also write AB = CD. (What we actually mean
is AB≅ CD).
7.4  CONGRUENCE OF ANGLES
Look at the four angles given here (Fig 7.5).
(iii)
Fig 7.5
Make a trace-copy of ∠PQR. Try to superpose it on ∠ABC. For this, first place
Q on B and QP
along BA
. Where does QR
fall? It falls onBC
Thus, ∠PQR matches exactly with ∠ABC.
That is, ∠ABC and ∠PQR are congruent.
(Note that the measurement of these two congruent angles are same).
We write
∠ABC ≅∠PQR
m∠ABC = m ∠PQR(In this case, measure is 40°).
Now, you take a trace-copy of ∠LMN. Try to superpose it on ∠ABC. Place M on B
and ML
along BA
. Does MN
fall on BC
JJ ? No, in this case it does not happen. You find
that ∠ABC and ∠LMN do not cover each other exactly. So, they are not congruent.
(Note that, in this case, the measures of ∠ABC and ∠LMN are not equal).
What about angles ∠XYZ and ∠ABC? The raysYX
and YZ
, respectively appear
[in Fig 7.5 (iv)] to be longer than BA
and BC
JJ . You may, hence, think that ∠ABC is
‘smaller’ than ∠XYZ. But remember that the rays in the figure only indicate the direction
and not any length. On superposition, you will find that these two angles are also congruent.
We write
∠ABC ≅∠XYZ
m∠ABC = m∠XYZ
In view of (i) and (ii), we may even write
∠ABC ≅∠PQR ≅ ∠XYZ
If two angles have the same measure, they are congruent. Also, if two angles are
congruent, their measures are same.
MATHEMATICS
As in the case of line segments, congruency of angles entirely depends on the equality
of their measures. So, to say that two angles are congruent, we sometimes just say that the
angles are equal; and we write
∠ABC =  ∠PQR  (to mean ∠ABC ≅ ∠PQR).
7.5  CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
We saw that two line segments are congruent where one of them, is just a copy of the
other. Similarly, two angles are congruent if one of them is a copy of the other. We extend
this idea to triangles.
Two triangles are congruent if they are copies of each other and when superposed,
they cover each other exactly.
Fig 7.6
ΔABC and ΔPQR have the same size and shape. They are congruent. So, we would
express this as
ΔABC ≅ΔPQR
This means that, when you place ΔPQR on ΔABC, P falls on  A, Q falls on B and R
falls on C, also
falls along AB , QR falls along BC and PR  falls along AC. If, under
a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding parts
(i.e., angles and sides) that match one another are equal. Thus, in these two congruent
triangles, we have:
Corresponding vertices : A and P, B and Q, C and R.
Corresponding sides
ABand PQ, BC  and QR , AC and PR .
Corresponding angles
: ∠A and ∠P,   ∠B and ∠Q, ∠C and ∠R.
If you place ΔPQR on ΔABC such that P falls on B, then, should the other vertices
also correspond suitably? It need not happen! Take trace, copies of the triangles and try
to find out.
This shows that while talking about congruence of triangles, not only the measures of
angles and lengths of sides matter, but also the matching of vertices. In the above case, the
correspondence is
A ↔P, B ↔ Q,
C ↔ R
We may write this as
ABC ↔PQR
CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
EXAMPLE 1 ΔABC and ΔPQR are congruent under the correspondence:
ABC ↔RQP
Write the parts of ΔABC that correspond to
(ii) ∠Q
(iii)
SOLUTION  For better understanding of the correspondence, let us use a diagram (Fig 7.7).
Fig 7.7
The correspondence is ABC ↔ RQP. This means
A ↔ R  ;
B ↔ Q; and C ↔ P.
PQ ↔ CB
(ii) ∠Q ↔ ∠B   and (iii)
RP  ↔ AC
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
When two triangles, say ABC and PQR are given, there are, in all, six possible
matchings or correspondences. Two of them are
(i) ABC ↔ PQR
(ii) ABC ↔ QRP.
Find the other four correspondences by using two cutouts of triangles. Will all
these correspondences lead to congruence? Think about it.

7.6  CRITERIA FOR CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
We make use of triangular structures and patterns frequently in day-to-day life. So, it is
rewarding to find out when two triangular shapes will be congruent. If you have two triangles
drawn in your notebook and want to verify if they are congruent, you cannot everytime cut
out one of them and use method of superposition. Instead, if we can judge congruency in
terms of approrpriate measures, it would be quite useful. Let us try to do this.
A Game
Appu and Tippu play a game. Appu has drawn a triangle ABC (Fig 7.8) and
has noted the length of each of its sides and measure of each of its angles.
Tippu has not seen it. Appu challenges Tippu if he can draw a copy of his
ΔABC based on bits of information that Appu would give. Tippu attempts to
draw a triangle congruent to ΔABC, using the information provided by Appu.
The game starts. Carefully observe their conversation and their games.
SSS Game
Appu  : One side of ΔABC is 5.5 cm.
Tippu : With this information, I can draw any number of triangles (Fig 7.9)
but they need not be copies of ΔABC. The triangle I draw may be
obtuse-angled or right-angled or acute-angled. For example, here are a few.
(Obtuse-angled)
(Right-angled)
(Acute-angled)
Fig 7.9
I have used some arbitrary lengths for other sides. This gives me many triangles with
length of base 5.5 cm.
So, giving only one side-length will not help me to produce a copy of ΔABC.
Appu : Okay. I will give you the length of one more side. Take two sides of ΔABC to be
of lengths 5.5 cm and 3.4 cm.
Tippu : Even this will not be sufficient for the purpose. I can draw several triangles
(Fig 7.10) with the given information which may not be copies of ΔABC. Here are a few
to support my argument:
Fig 7.10
One cannot draw an exact copy of your triangle, if only the lengths of two sides
are given.
Fig 7.8

5.5 cm

CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
Fig 7.11
Appu : Alright. Let me give the lengths of all the three sides. In ΔABC, I have AB = 5cm,
BC = 5.5 cm and AC = 3.4 cm.
Tippu : I think it should be possible. Let me try now.
First I draw a rough figure so that I can remember the lengths easily.
I draw BC with length 5.5 cm.
With B as centre, I draw an arc of radius 5 cm. The point A has to be somewhere on
this arc. With C as centre, I draw an arc of radius 3.4 cm. The point A has to be on this arc
also.
So, A lies on both the arcs drawn. This means A is the point of intersection of the arcs.
I know now the positions of points A, B and C. Aha! I can join them and get ΔABC
(Fig 7.11).
Appu : Excellent. So, to draw a copy of a given ΔABC (i.e., to draw a triangle
congruent to ΔABC), we need the lengths of three sides. Shall we call this condition
as side-side-side criterion?
Tippu : Why not we call it SSS criterion, to be short?
SSS Congruence criterion:
If under a given correspondence, the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three
corresponding sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
EXAMPLE 2 In triangles ABC and PQR, AB = 3.5 cm, BC = 7.1 cm,
AC = 5 cm, PQ = 7.1 cm, QR = 5 cm and PR = 3.5 cm.
Examine whether the two triangles are congruent or not.
If yes, write the congruence relation in symbolic form.
SOLUTION
Here,
AB = PR (= 3.5 cm),
BC = PQ ( = 7.1 cm)
AC = QR (= 5 cm)
This shows that the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides
of the other triangle. So, by SSS congruence rule, the two triangles are
congruent. From the above three equality relations, it can be easily seen
that A ↔ R, B ↔ P and C ↔ Q.
So, we have
ΔABC ≅ΔRPQ
Important note: The order of the letters in the names of congruent triangles displays the
corresponding relationships. Thus, when you write ΔABC ≅ ΔRPQ, you would know
that A lies on R, B on P, C on Q, AB along RP , BC  along PQ and AC along RQ .

(i) State the three pairs of equal parts in ΔABD and  ΔCBD.
(ii) Is ΔABD ≅ ΔCBD? Why or why not?
(iii) Does BD bisect ∠ABC? Give reasons.
SOLUTION
(i) In ΔABD and ΔCBD, the three pairs of equal parts are as given below:
AB = CB  (Given)
AD = CD  (Given)
BD = BD  (Common in both)
(ii) From (i) above, ΔABD ≅ ΔCBD  (By SSS congruence rule)
(iii) ∠ABD = ∠CBD     (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)
So, BD bisects ∠ABC.

congruence rule, state which pairs of triangles are congruent. In case of congruent

of the following statements is meaningfully written?
(i) ΔABC ≅ ΔABD
(ii) ΔABC ≅ ΔBAD.

Take a trace-copy of ΔABC and also name it as  ΔABC.
(i) State the three pairs of equal parts in ΔABC and  ΔACB.
(ii) Is ΔABC ≅ ΔACB? Why or why not?
(iii) Is ∠B = ∠C ? Why or why not?
Appu and Tippu now turn to playing the game with a slight modification.
SAS Game
Appu : Let me now change the rules of the triangle-copying game.
Tippu : Right, go ahead.
Appu : You have already found that giving the length of only one side is useless.
Tippu : Of course, yes.
Appu : In that case, let me tell that in ΔABC, one side is 5.5 cm and one angle is 65°.
Tippu : This again is not sufficient for the job. I can find many triangles satisfying your
information, but are not copies of  ΔABC. For example, I have given here some of them
(Fig 7.18):
Fig 7.18
Fig 7.16
Fig 7.17
MATHEMATICS
Appu  : So, what shall we do?
Tippu : More information is needed.
Appu  : Then, let me modify my earlier statement. In  ΔABC, the length of two sides are
5.5 cm and 3.4 cm, and the angle between these two sides is 65°.
Tippu : This information should help me. Let me try. I draw first BC  of length 5.5. cm
[Fig 7.19 (i)]. Now I make 65° at C [Fig 7.19 (ii)].
Fig 7.19
Yes, I got it, A must be 3.4 cm away from C along this angular line through C.
I draw an arc of 3.4 cm with C as centre. It cuts the 65° line at A.
Now, I join AB and get ΔABC [Fig 7.19(iii)].
: You have used side-angle-side, where the angle is ‘included’ between the sides!
Tippu : Yes. How shall we name this criterion?
: It is SAS criterion. Do you follow it?
Tippu : Yes, of course.
SAS Congruence criterion:
If under a correspondence, two sides and the angle included between them of a triangle
are equal to two corresponding sides and the angle included between them of another
triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
EXAMPLE 4 Given below are measurements of some parts of two triangles. Examine
whether the two triangles are congruent or not, by using SAS congruence
rule. If the triangles are congruent, write them in symbolic form.
(a) AB = 7 cm, BC = 5 cm, ∠B = 50°
DE = 5 cm, EF =  7 cm, ∠E = 50°
(b) AB = 4.5 cm, AC = 4 cm, ∠A = 60°
DE = 4 cm, FD =  4.5 cm, ∠D = 55°
(c) BC = 6 cm, AC = 4 cm, ∠B = 35°
DF = 4 cm, EF = 6 cm, ∠E = 35°
(It will be always helpful to draw a rough figure, mark the measurements and then
probe the question).

(iii)
CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
SOLUTION
(a) Here,   AB = EF  ( = 7 cm), BC = DE ( = 5 cm) and
included ∠B = included ∠E ( = 50°). Also, A ↔ F  B ↔ E and C ↔ D.
Therefore, ΔABC ≅ ΔFED (By SAS congruence rule) (Fig 7.20)
(b) Here, AB = FD and  AC = DE (Fig 7.21).
But included ∠A ≠ included ∠D. So, we cannot say that the triangles are
congruent.
(c) Here, BC = EF,  AC = DF and ∠B = ∠E.
But ∠B is  not the included angle between the sides AC and BC.
Similarly, ∠E is not the included angle between the sides EF and DF.
So, SAS congruence rule cannot be applied and we cannot conclude
that the two triangles are congruent.
EXAMPLE 5 In Fig 7.23, AB = AC and AD is the bisector of ∠BAC.
(i) State three pairs of equal parts in triangles ADB and ADC.
(ii) Is ΔADB ≅ ΔADC? Give reasons.
(iii) Is ∠B = ∠C? Give reasons.
SOLUTION
(i) The three pairs of equal parts are as follows:
AB = AC  (Given)
∠BAD  = ∠CAD  (AD bisects ∠BAC) and AD = AD  (common)
(ii) Yes, ΔADB ≅ ΔADC (By SAS congruence rule)
(iii) ∠B = ∠C  (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)
1. Which angle is included between the sides DE  and EF  of ΔDEF?

4. In Fig 7.25, AB and CD bisect each other at O.
(i) State the three pairs of equal parts in two
triangles AOC and BOD.
(ii) Which of the following statements are true?
(a) ΔAOC ≅ ΔDOB
(b) ΔAOC ≅ ΔBOD

Can you draw Appu’s triangle, if you know
(i) only one of its angles?
(ii) only two of its angles?
(iii)
two angles and any one side?
(iv) two angles and the side included between them?
Attempts to solve the above questions lead us to the following criterion:
ASA Congruence criterion:
If under a correspondence, two angles and the included side of a triangle are equal to
two corresponding angles and the included side of another triangle, then the triangles
are congruent.
EXAMPLE 6 By applying ASA congruence rule, it is to be established that ΔABC ≅ ΔQRP
and it is given that BC = RP. What additional information is needed to
establish the congruence?
Fig 7.24
(iii)
Fig 7.25
CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
SOLUTION
For ASA congruence rule, we need the two angles between which the
two sides BC and RP are included. So, the additional information is
as follows:
∠B = ∠R
∠C = ∠P
EXAMPLE 7 In Fig 7.26, can you use ASA congruence
rule and conclude that ΔAOC ≅ ΔBOD?
SOLUTION
In the two triangles AOC and BOD, ∠C = ∠D (each 70° )
Also,
∠AOC = ∠BOD = 30°  (vertically opposite angles)
∠A of ΔAOC = 180° – (70° + 30°)   =  80°
(using angle sum property of a triangle)
Similarly,
∠B of ΔBOD = 180° – (70° + 30°) =  80°
Thus, we have
∠A = ∠B,   AC = BD and ∠C = ∠D
Now, side AC is between ∠A and ∠C and side BD is between ∠B and ∠D.
So, by ASA congruence rule, ΔAOC ≅ ΔBOD.
Remark
Given two angles of a triangle, you can always find the third angle of the triangle. So,
whenever, two angles and one side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two
angles and one side of another triangle, you may convert it into ‘two angles and the included
side’ form of congruence and then apply the ASA congruence rule.
1. What is the side included between the angles M and N of ΔMNP?
2. You want to establish ΔDEF ≅ ΔMNP, using the ASA congruence rule. You are
given that ∠D = ∠M and ∠F = ∠P. What information is needed to establish the
congruence? (Draw a rough figure and then try!)

rule, state which pairs of triangles are congruent. In case of congruence, write the
result in symoblic form.

(ii) Is  ΔBAC ≅ ΔDAC?  Give reasons.
(iii) Is AB = AD? Justify your answer.
(iv) Is CD = CB? Give reasons.
7.7 CONGRUENCE AMONG RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES
Congruence in the case of two right triangles deserves special attention. In such triangles,
obviously, the right angles are equal. So, the congruence criterion becomes easy.
Can you draw ΔABC (shown in Fig 7.29) with ∠B = 90°, if
(i) only BC is known?
(ii) only ∠C is known?
(iii) ∠A and ∠C are known?
(iv) AB and BC are known?
(v) AC and one of AB or BC are known?
Try these with rough sketches. You will find that (iv) and (v) help you to draw the
triangle. But case (iv) is simply the SAS condition. Case (v) is something new. This leads to
the following criterion:
RHS Congruence criterion:
If under a correspondence, the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are
respectively equal to the hypotenuse and one side of another right-angled triangle, then
the triangles are congruent.
Why do we call this ‘RHS’ congruence? Think about it.

CONGRUENCE OF TRIANGLES
EXAMPLE 8 Given below are measurements of some parts of two triangles. Examine
whether the two triangles are congruent or not, using RHS congruence
rule. In case of congruent triangles, write the result in symbolic form:
(i) ∠B = 90°, AC = 8 cm, AB = 3 cm
∠P = 90°, PR = 3 cm, QR = 8 cm
(ii) ∠A = 90°, AC = 5 cm, BC = 9 cm
∠Q = 90°, PR = 8 cm, PQ = 5 cm
SOLUTION
(i) Here,  ∠B = ∠P = 90º,
hypotenuse, AC = hypotenuse, RQ (= 8 cm) and
side AB = side RP ( = 3 cm)
So, ΔABC ≅ ΔRPQ (By RHS Congruence rule). [Fig 7.30(i)]
(ii) Here, ∠A = ∠Q(= 90°) and
side AC = side PQ ( = 5 cm).
But hypotenuse BC ≠ hypotenuse PR [Fig 7.30(ii)]
So, the triangles are not congruent.
EXAMPLE 9 In Fig 7.31, DA  ⊥ AB, CB ⊥ AB and AC = BD.
State the three pairs of equal parts in ΔABC and ΔDAB.
Which of the following statements is meaningful?
(i) ΔABC ≅ ΔBAD
(ii) ΔABC ≅ ΔABD
SOLUTION
The three pairs of equal parts are:
∠ABC = ∠BAD  (= 90°)
AC = BD  (Given)
AB = BA (Common side)
From the above,
ΔABC ≅ΔBAD  (By RHS congruence rule).
So, statement  (i) is true
Statement (ii) is not meaningful, in the sense that the correspondence among the vertices
is not satisfied.

We saw that superposition is a useful method to test congruence of plane figures. We
discussed conditions for congruence of line segments, angles and triangles. You can now
try to extend this idea to other plane figures as well.
1. Consider cut-outs of different sizes of squares. Use the method of superposition to
find out the condition for congruence of squares. How does the idea of
‘corresponding parts’ under congruence apply? Are there corresponding sides? Are
there corresponding diagonals?
2. What happens if you take circles? What is the condition for congruence of two
circles? Again, you can use the method of superposition. Investigate.
3. Try to extend this idea to other plane figures like regular hexagons, etc.
4. Take two congruent copies of a triangle. By paper folding, investigate if they have
equal altitudes. Do they have equal medians? What can you say about their perimeters
and areas?
WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Congruent objects are exact copies of one another.
The method of superposition examines the congruence of plane figures.
Two plane figures, say, F1 and F2 are congruent if the trace-copy of F1 fits exactly on
that of F2. We write this as F1 ≅ F2.
Two line segments, say, AB  and CD , are congruent if they have equal lengths. We
write this as AB
. However, it is common to write it as AB  = CD .
Two angles, say, ∠ABC and ∠PQR, are congruent if their measures are equal. We
write this as ∠ABC ≅ ∠PQR or as m∠ABC = m∠PQR. However, in practice, it is
common to write it as ∠ABC = ∠PQR.
SSS Congruence of two triangles:
Under a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent if the three sides of the
one are equal to the three corresponding sides of the other.
SAS Congruence of two triangles:
Under a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent if two sides and the angle
included between them in one of the triangles are equal to the corresponding sides and
the angle included between them of the other triangle.

ASA Congruence of two triangles:
Under a given correspondence, two triangles are congruent if two angles and the side
included between them in one of the triangles are equal to the corresponding angles
and the side included between them of the other triangle.
RHS Congruence of two right-angled triangles:
Under a given correspondence, two right-angled triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse
and a leg of one of the triangles are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding leg
of the other triangle.
There is no such thing as AAA Congruence of two triangles:
Two triangles with equal corresponding angles need not be congruent. In such a
correspondence, one of them can be an enlarged copy of the other.  (They would be
congruent only if they are exact copies of one another).
COMPARING QUANTITIES
8.1  INTRODUCTION
In our daily life, there are many occasions when we compare two quantities.
Suppose we are comparing heights of Heena and Amir. We find that
1. Heena is two times taller than Amir.
2. Amir’s height is 1
2  of Heena’s height.
Consider another example, where 20 marbles are divided between Rita and
Amit such that Rita has 12 marbles and
Amit has 8 marbles. We say,
1.  Rita has 3
2  times the marbles that Amit has.
2. Amit has  2
3  part of what Rita has.
Yet another example is where we compare
speeds of a Cheetah and a Man.
The speed of a Cheetah is 6 times the speed
of a Man.
The speed of a Man is 1
6  of the speed of
the Cheetah.
Do you remember comparisons like this? In Class VI, we have learnt to make comparisons
by saying how many times one quantity is of the other. Here, we see that it can also be
inverted and written as what part one quantity is of the other.
Chapter  8
Comparing
Quantities
150 cm 75 cm
Heena
Speed of Cheetah
Speed of Man
120 km per hour
20 km per hour
MATHEMATICS
In the given cases, we write the ratio of the heights as :
Heena’s height : Amir’s height is 150 : 75  or 2 : 1.
Can you now write the ratios for the other comparisons?
These are relative comparisons and could be same for two different situations.
If Heena’s height was 150 cm and Amir’s was 100 cm, then the ratio of their heights would be,
Heena’s height : Amir’s height = 150 : 100 = 150
or 3 : 2.
This is same as the ratio for Rita’s to Amit’s share of marbles.
Thus, we see that the ratio for two different comparisons may be the same. Remember
that to compare two quantities, the units must be the same.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the ratio of 3 km to 300 m.
SOLUTION
First convert both the distances to the same unit.
3 km = 3 × 1000 m = 3000 m.
Thus,
the required ratio, 3 km : 300 m is 3000 : 300 = 10 : 1.
8.2  EQUIVALENT RATIOS
Different ratios can also be compared with each other to know whether they are equivalent
or not. To do this, we need to write the ratios in the form of fractions and then compare
them by converting them to like fractions. If these like fractions are equal, we say the given
ratios are equivalent.
EXAMPLE 2 Are the ratios 1:2 and 2:3 equivalent?
SOLUTION
To check this, we need to know whether 1
We have,
We find that
, which means that 1
Therefore, the ratio 1:2 is not equivalent to the ratio 2:3.
Use of such comparisons can be seen by the following example.
EXAMPLE 3 Following is the performance of a cricket team in the matches it played:
Losses
Last year
In which year was the record better?
This year
How can you say so?
COMPARING QUANTITIES
SOLUTION
Last year, Wins: Losses = 8 : 2 = 4 : 1
This year, Wins: Losses = 4 : 2 = 2 : 1
Obviously, 4 : 1 > 2 : 1 (In fractional form, 4
Hence, we can say that the team performed better last year.
In Class VI, we have also seen the importance of equivalent ratios. The ratios which
are equivalent are said to be in proportion. Let us recall the use of proportions.
Keeping things in proportion and getting solutions
Aruna made a sketch of the building she lives in and drew sketch of her
mother standing beside the building.
Mona said, “There seems to be something wrong with the drawing”
Can you say what is wrong? How can you say this?
In this case, the ratio of heights in the drawing should be the same as the
ratio of actual heights. That is
Actual height of building
Actual height of mother  = Height of building in drawing
Height of mother in the drawing  .
Only then would these be in proportion. Often when proportions are maintained, the
drawing seems pleasing to the eye.
Another example where proportions are used is in the making of national flags.
Do you know that the flags are always made in a fixed ratio of length to its breadth?
These may be different for different countries but are mostly around 1.5 : 1 or 1.7 : 1.
We can take an approximate value of this ratio as 3 : 2. Even the Indian post card is
around the same ratio.
Now, can you say whether a card with length 4.5 cm and breadth 3.0 cm
is near to this ratio. That is we need to ask, is 4.5 : 3.0 equivalent to 3 : 2?
We note that     4 5 3 0
. : .
Hence, we see that 4.5 : 3.0 is equivalent to 3 : 2.
We see a wide use of such proportions in real life. Can you think of some more
situations?
We have also learnt a method in the earlier classes known as Unitary Method in
which we first find the value of one unit and then the value of the required number of units.
Let us see how both the above methods help us to achieve the same thing.
EXAMPLE 4 A map is given with a scale of 2 cm = 1000 km. What is the actual distance
between the two places in kms, if the distance in the map is 2.5 cm?
MATHEMATICS
SOLUTION
Arun does it like this
Meera does it like this
Let distance = x km
2 cm means 1000 km.
then, 1000 : x = 2 : 2.5
So, 1 cm means 1000 km
Hence, 2.5 cm means 1000
= 1250 km
1000 × 2.5 = x × 2
x = 1250
Arun has solved it by equating ratios to make proportions and then by solving the
equation. Meera has first found the distance that corresponds to 1 cm and then used that to
find what 2.5 cm would correspond to. She used the unitary method.
Let us solve some more examples using the unitary method.
EXAMPLE 5 6 bowls cost ` 90. What would be the cost of 10 such bowls?
SOLUTION
Cost of 6 bowls is ` 90.
Therefore,
cost of 1 bowl = ` 90
Hence,
cost of 10 bowls = ` 90
6 × 10 = ` 150
EXAMPLE 6 The car that I own can go 150 km with 25 litres of petrol. How far can
it go with 30 litres of petrol?
SOLUTION
With 25 litres of petrol, the car goes 150 km.
With 1 litre the car will go 150
Hence, with 30 litres of petrol it would go 150
km = 180 km
In this method, we first found the value for one unit or the unit rate. This is done by the
comparison of two different properties. For example, when you compare total cost to
number of items, we get cost per item or if you take distance travelled to time taken, we get
distance per unit time.
Thus, you can see that we often use  per  to mean   for each.
For example, km per hour, children per teacher etc., denote unit rates.

8.3  PERCENTAGE – ANOTHER WAY OF COMPARING QUANTITIES
Anita’s Report
Rita’s Report
Total 320/400
Total 300/360
Percentage: 80
Percentage: 83.3
Anita said that she has done better as she got 320 marks whereas Rita got only 300. Do
you agree with her? Who do you think has done better?
Mansi told them that they cannot decide who has done better by just comparing the
total marks obtained because the maximum marks out of which they got the marks are not
the same.
She said why don’t you see the Percentages given in your report cards?
Anita’s Percentage was 80 and Rita’s was 83.3. So, this shows Rita has done better.
Do you agree?
Percentages are numerators of fractions with denominator 100 and have been
used in comparing results. Let us try to understand in detail about it.
8.3.1  Meaning of Percentage
Per cent is derived from Latin word ‘per centum’ meaning ‘per hundred’.
Per cent is represented by the symbol % and means hundredths too. That is 1% means
1 out of hundred or one hundredth. It can be written as:  1% = 1
100  = 0.01
MATHEMATICS
To understand this, let us consider the following example.
Rina made a table top of 100 different coloured tiles. She counted yellow, green, red
and blue tiles separately and filled the table below. Can you help her complete the table?

Size 5 : 14
Size 6 : 8
Write this information in tabular form as done earlier and
find the Percentage of each shoe size available in the shop.
Percentages when total is not hundred
In all these examples, the total number of items add up to 100. For example, Rina had 100
tiles in all, there were 100 children and 100 shoe pairs. How do we calculate Percentage
of an item if the total number of items do not add up to 100? In such cases, we need to
convert the fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 100. Consider the following
example. You have a necklace with twenty beads in two colours.

COMPARING QUANTITIES

We see that these three methods can be used to find the Percentage when the total
does not add to give 100. In the method shown in the table, we multiply the fraction by
100 . This does not change the value of the fraction. Subsequently, only 100 remains in the
denominator.
Anwar has used the unitary method. Asha has multiplied by 5
5  to get 100 in the
denominator. You can use whichever method you find suitable. May be, you can make
your own method too.
The method used by Anwar can work for all ratios. Can the method used by Asha also
work for all ratios? Anwar says Asha’s method can be used only if you can find a natural
number which on multiplication with the denominator gives 100. Since denominator was 20,
she could multiply it by 5 to get 100. If the denominator was 6, she would not have been
able to use this method. Do you agree?

8.3.2  Converting Fractional Numbers to Percentage
Fractional numbers can have different denominator. To compare fractional numbers, we
need a common denominator and we have seen that it is more convenient to compare if
our denominator is 100. That is, we are converting the fractions to Percentages. Let us try
converting different fractional numbers to Percentages.

can be converted to per cents.

(a) 0.75
(b) 0.09
(c) 0.2
SOLUTION
(a) 0.75 = 0.75 × 100 %
(b) 0.09 = 9
100  = 9 %
100  × 100 % = 75%

8.3.4  Converting Percentages to Fractions or Decimals

reverse. That is, given per cents, we can convert them to decimals or fractions. Look at the

table, observe and complete it:
Per cent

Parts always add to give a whole
In the examples for coloured tiles, for the heights of
children and for gases in the air, we find that when we
add the Percentages we get 100. All the parts that form
the whole when added together gives the whole or 100%.
So, if we are given one part, we can always find out the
other part. Suppose, 30% of a given number of students are boys.
This means that if there were 100 students, 30 out of them would be boys and the
remaining  would be girls.
Then girls would obviously be (100 – 30)% = 70%.
1. 35% + _______% = 100%,

8.4  USE OF PERCENTAGES
8.4.1  Interpreting Percentages
We saw how percentages were helpful in comparison. We have also learnt to convert
fractional numbers and decimals to percentages. Now, we shall learn how percentages
can be used in real life. For this, we start with interpreting the following statements:
— 5% of the income is saved by Ravi. — 20% of Meera’s dresses are blue in colour.
— Rekha gets 10% on every book sold by her.
What can you infer from each of these statements?
By 5% we mean 5 parts out of 100 or we write it as 5
100 . It means Ravi is saving
` 5 out of every ` 100 that he earns. In the same way, interpret the rest of the statements
given above.
8.4.2  Converting Percentages to “How Many”
Consider the following examples:
EXAMPLE 12 A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football. How
many children liked playing football?

SOLUTION

means that 25% reduction in price is the amount saved by Rahul. Let us
see how Mohan and Abdul have found the original cost of the sweater.
Mohan’s solution
Abdul’s solution
25% of the original price = ` 20

8.4.3  Ratios to Percents
Sometimes, parts are given to us in the form of ratios and we need to convert those to
percentages. Consider the following example:
EXAMPLE 14 Reena’s mother said, to make idlis, you must take two parts rice and
one part urad dal. What percentage of such a mixture would be rice
and what percentage would be urad dal?
SOLUTION
In terms of ratio we would write this as Rice : Urad dal = 2 : 1.
Now, 2 + 1=3 is the total of all parts. This means 2
3  part is rice and 1
3 part is urad dal.
Then, percentage of rice would be 2

8.4.4  Increase or Decrease as Per Cent
There are times when we need to know the increase or decrease in a certain quantity as
percentage. For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to
6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say, the
population increased by 10 %.
How do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity as a percentage of the initial
amount? Consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 16 A school team won 6 games this year against 4 games won last year.
What is the per cent increase?
SOLUTION
The increase in the number of wins (or amount of change) = 6 – 4 = 2.
Percentage increase =
amount of change
original amount or base 100
= increase in the number of wins ×100
original number of wins
EXAMPLE 17 The number of illiterate persons in a country decreased from 150 lakhs

8.5  PRICES RELATED TO AN ITEM OR BUYING AND SELLING
I bought it for ` 600
and will sell it for ` 610
The buying price of any item is known as its cost price. It is written in short as CP.
The price at which you sell is known as the selling price or in short SP.
What would you say is better, to you sell the item at a lower price, same price or higher
price than your buying price? You can decide whether the sale was profitable or not
depending on the CP and SP. If CP < SP  then you made a profit = SP – CP.
If CP = SP  then you are in a no profit no loss situation.
If CP > SP  then you have a loss = CP – SP.
Let us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items.
z A toy bought for ` 72 is sold at ` 80.
z A T-shirt bought for ` 120 is sold at ` 100.
z A cycle bought for ` 800 is sold for ` 940.
Let us consider the first statement.
The buying price (or CP) is ` 72 and the selling price (or SP) is ` 80. This means SP
is more than CP. Hence profit made  = SP – CP  = ` 80 – ` 72 = ` 8
Now try interpreting the remaining statements in a similar way.
8.5.1  Profit or Loss as a Percentage
The profit or loss can be converted to a percentage. It is always calculated on the CP.
For the above examples, we can find the profit % or loss %.
Let us consider the example related to the toy. We have CP = ` 72, SP = ` 80,
Profit = ` 8. To find the percentage of profit, Neha and Shekhar have used the
following methods.
TRY THESE
MATHEMATICS
Thus, the profit is ` 8 and
profit Per cent is
119 .
Thus, by both methods we get the SP as
` 108.
Neha does it this way
Shekhar does it this way
Profit per cent = Profit
CP × 100 = 8
On ` 72 the profit is ` 8
= 111
On ` 100,  profit = 8
= 111
. Thus, profit per cent =
Similarly you can find the loss per cent in the second situation. Here,
CP = ` 120, SP = ` 100.
Therefore,  Loss = ` 120 – ` 100 = ` 20
Loss per cent = Loss ×100
= 20 ×100
Thus, loss per cent is
Try the last case.
Now we see that given any two out of the three quantities related to prices that is, CP,
SP, amount of Profit or Loss or their percentage, we can find the rest.
EXAMPLE 18 The cost of a flower vase is ` 120. If the shopkeeper sells it at a loss
of 10%, find the price at which it is sold.
SOLUTION
We are given that CP = ` 120 and Loss per cent = 10. We have to find
the SP.
Sohan does it like this
Anandi does it like this
Loss of 10% means if  CP is ` 100,
Loss is 10% of the cost price
Loss is ` 10
= 10% of ` 120
Therefore, SP would be
100 ×
= ` 12
` (100 – 10) = ` 90
Therefore
When CP is ` 100, SP is ` 90.
SP = CP – Loss
Therefore, if CP were  ` 120 then
= ` 120 – ` 12 = ` 108
SP = 90
100 ×
= ` 108
On ` 120, the loss is ` 20
So on ` 100, the loss

EXAMPLE 19 Selling price of a toy car is ` 540. If the profit made by shopkeeper is
20%, what is the cost price of this toy?
SOLUTION
We are given that SP = ` 540 and the  Profit = 20%. We need to find the CP.
Amina does it like this
Arun does it like this
20% profit will mean if CP is ` 100,
Profit = 20% of CP and SP = CP + Profit
profit is ` 20
So, 540 = CP + 20% of CP
= CP + 20
100  × CP =
= 6 CP
.  Therefore,
or  ` 450 = CP
Thus, by both methods, the cost price is ` 450.
1. A shopkeeper bought a chair for ` 375 and sold it for ` 400. Find the gain Percentage.
2. Cost of an item is ` 50. It was sold with a profit of 12%. Find the selling price.
3. An article was sold for ` 250 with a profit of 5%. What was its cost price?
4. An item was sold for ` 540 at a loss of 5%. What was its cost price?
8.6 CHARGE GIVEN ON BORROWED MONEY OR SIMPLE
INTEREST
Sohini said that they were going to buy a new scooter. Mohan asked her
whether they had the money to buy it. Sohini said her father was going
to take a loan from a bank. The money you borrow is known as sum
borrowed or principal.
This money would be used by the borrower for some time before it is
returned. For keeping this money for some time the borrower has to pay
some extra money to the bank. This is known as Interest.
You can find the amount you have to pay at the end of the year by adding the sum
borrowed and the interest. That is, Amount = Principal + Interest.
Interest is generally given in per cent for a period of one year. It is written as  say 10%
per year or per annum or in short as 10% p.a. (per annum).
10% p.a. means on every ` 100 borrowed, ` 10 is the interest you have to pay for one
year. Let us take an example and see how this works.
EXAMPLE 20 Anita takes a loan of ` 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find
the interest she has to pay at the end of one year.
Therefore, SP = 100 + 20  = 120
Now, when SP is ` 120,
then CP is ` 100.
Therefore, when SP is ` 540,
then CP = 100
120 ×
= ` 450
TRY THESE
MATHEMATICS
SOLUTION
The sum borrowed = ` 5,000, Rate of interest = 15% per year.
This means if ` 100 is borrowed, she has to pay ` 15 as interest for one year. If she has
borrowed ` 5,000, then the interest she has to pay for one year
= ` 15
100 ×
= ` 750
So,  at the end of the year she has to give an amount of  ` 5,000 + ` 750 =  ` 5,750.
We can write a general relation to find interest for one year. Take P as the principal or
sum and R % as Rate per cent per annum.
Now on every ` 100 borrowed, the interest paid is ` R
Therefore, on ` P borrowed, the interest paid for one year would be 100
100 .
8.6.1  Interest for Multiple Years
If the amount is borrowed for more than one year the interest is calculated for the period
the money is kept for. For example, if Anita returns the money at the end of two years and
the rate of interest is the same then she would have to pay twice the interest i.e., ` 750 for
the first year and ` 750 for the second. This way of calculating interest where principal is
not changed is known as simple interest. As the number of years increase the interest
also increases. For ` 100 borrowed for 3 years at 18%, the interest to be paid at the end
of 3 years is 18 + 18 + 18 = 3 × 18 = ` 54.
We can find the general form for simple interest for more than one year.
We know that on a principal of ` P at R% rate of interest per year, the interest paid for
one year is
. Therefore, interest I paid for T years would be
And amount you have to pay at the end of T years is
A = P + I
` 10,000 is invested at 5% interest rate p.a. Find the interest at the end of one
year.
` 3,500 is given at 7% p.a. rate of interest. Find the interest which will be received
at the end of two years.
` 6,050 is borrowed at 6.5% rate of interest p.a.. Find the interest and the amount
to be paid at the end of 3 years.
` 7,000 is borrowed at 3.5% rate of interest p.a. borrowed for 2 years. Find the
amount to be paid at the end of the second year.
Just as in the case of prices related to items, if you are given any two of the three
quantities in the relation
, you could find the remaining quantity.

weights, salaries, marks etc.
2. While comparing heights of two persons with heights150 cm and 75 cm, we write it

3. Two ratios can be compared by converting them to like fractions. If the two fractions
are equal, we say the two given ratios are equivalent.
4. If two ratios are equivalent then the four quantities are said to be in proportion. For
example, the ratios 8 : 2 and 16 : 4 are equivalent therefore 8, 2, 16 and 4 are in
proportion.

RATIONAL NUMBERS
9.1  INTRODUCTION
You began your study of numbers by counting objects around you.
The numbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or
natural numbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, ... By including 0 to natural
numbers, we got the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The negatives
of natural numbers were then put together with whole numbers to make
up integers. Integers are ..., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... We, thus, extended
the number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from
whole numbers to integers.
You were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form numerator
denominator
where the numerator is either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator, a positive integer.
You compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them.
In this Chapter, we shall extend  the number system further. We shall introduce the concept
of rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.
9.2  NEED FOR RATIONAL NUMBERS
Earlier, we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving
numbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then
the distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by –5. If a profit of ` 150
was represented by 150 then a loss of ` 100 could be written as –100.
There are many situations similar to the above situations that involve fractional numbers.
You can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as 3
4  km. Can we represent 750m
below sea level in km? Can we denote the distance of 3
4  km below sea level by 3
4 ? We can
see 3
4  is neither an integer, nor a fractional number. We need to extend our number system
to include such numbers.
Chapter  9

MATHEMATICS
9.3  WHAT ARE RATIONAL NUMBERS?
The word ‘rational’ arises from the term ‘ratio’. You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be
written as 3
. Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers.
Similarly, the ratio of two integers p and q (q ≠ 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form
q . This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed.
A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed in the
form p
q , where p and q are integers and q ≠  0.
Thus, 4
5  is a rational number. Here, p = 4 and q = 5.
Is 3
4  also a rational number? Yes, because p = – 3 and q = 4 are integers.
You have seen many fractions like 3
etc. All fractions are rational
numbers. Can you say why?
How about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be
written as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 5
0.333 = 333
1000  etc.
1. Is the number 2
rational? Think about it.
2. List ten rational numbers.
Numerator and Denominator
q , the integer p is the numerator, and the integer q (≠ 0) is the denominator.
Thus, in 3
7 , the numerator is –3 and the denominator is 7.
Mention five rational numbers each of whose
(a) Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer.
(b) Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer.
(c) Numerator and denominator both are negative integers.
(d) Numerator and denominator both are positive integers.
z Are integers also rational numbers?
Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer –5 is a
rational number, because you can write it as 5
. The integer 0 can also be written as
etc. Hence, it is also a rational number.
Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions.

RATIONAL NUMBERS
Equivalent rational numbers
A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example,
consider the rational number
. We see that
3  is the same as 4
Also,
. So, 2
3  is also the same as 10
Thus, 2
3  = 4
6  = 10
. Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to
be equivalent to each other.
Again,
= −10
15  (How?)
By multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational
number by the same non zero integer, we obtain another rational
number equivalent to the given rational number. This is exactly like
obtaining equivalent fractions.
Just as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator
by the same non zero integer, also gives equivalent rational numbers. For
example,
–15  =
,     –12
24  =
12 12
24 12
We write
, etc.
9.4  POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RATIONAL NUMBERS
Consider the rational number 2
. Both the numerator and denominator of this number are
positive integers. Such a rational number is called a positive rational number. So, 3
etc. are positive rational number.
The numerator of 3
5  is a negative integer, whereas the denominator
is a positive integer. Such a rational number is called a negative rational
number. So,  ,  ,

9.5  RATIONAL NUMBERS ON A NUMBER LINE
You know how to represent integers on a number line. Let us draw one such number line.
The points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points
to the left of 0 are denoted by – sign and are negative integers.
Representation of fractions on a number line is also known to you.
Let us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line.
Let us represent the number −1
2  on the number line.
As done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked
on the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0.
To which side of 0 will you mark −1
2 ? Being a negative rational number, it would be
marked to the left of 0.
You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are
marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and –1 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2
and –2, 3 and –3.

In the same way, the rational numbers 1
2  and −1
2  would be at equal distance from 0.
We know how to mark the rational number 1
2 . It is marked at a point which is half the
distance between 0 and 1. So, −1
2  would be marked at a point half the distance between
0 and –1.
We know how to mark 3
2  on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies
halfway between 1 and 2. Let us now mark 3
− on the number line. It lies on the left of 0
and is at the same distance as 3
2  from 0.
In decreasing order, we have,
. This shows that
− lies between – 1 and – 2. Thus, 3
− lies halfway between – 1 and – 2.
Mark −5
2  and −7
2  in a similar way.
Similarly, −1
3  is to the left of zero and at the same distance from zero as 1
3  is to the
right. So as done above, −1
3  can be represented on the number line. Once we know how
to represent −1
3  on the number line, we can go on representing −2
,  ,   and so on.
All other rational numbers with different denominators can be represented in a similar way.
9.6  RATIONAL NUMBERS IN STANDARD FORM
Observe the rational numbers 3
The denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and 1 is
the only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further,
the negative sign occurs only in the numerator.
Such rational numbers are said to be in standard form.
= ( )
= ( )
= ( )
MATHEMATICS
A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a
positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other
than 1.
If a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the
standard form.
Recall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and
the denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer. We shall use the
same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form.
EXAMPLE 1 Reduce 45
30  to the standard form.
SOLUTION
We have,
We had to divide twice. First time by 3 and then by 5. This could also be done as
45 15
30 15
In this example, note that 15 is the HCF of 45 and 30.
Thus, to reduce the rational number to its standard form, we divide its numerator
and denominator by their HCF ignoring the negative sign, if any. (The reason for
ignoring the negative sign will be studied in Higher Classes)
If there is negative sign in the denominator, divide by ‘– HCF’.
EXAMPLE 2 Reduce to standard form:
SOLUTION
(i) The HCF of 36 and 24 is 12.
Thus, its standard form would be obtained by dividing by –12.
(ii) The HCF of 3 and 15 is 3.

9.7  COMPARISON OF RATIONAL NUMBERS
We know how to compare two integers or two fractions and tell which is smaller or which
is greater among them. Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers.
z Two positive rational numbers, like 2
can be compared as studied earlier in the
case of fractions.
z Mary compared two negative rational numbers −1
2  and −1
5  using number line. She
knew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer, was the greater
integer.
For example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 > 2. The integer – 2 is on
the right of – 5 on the number line and  – 2 > – 5.
She used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers
on the number line. She marked −1
2  and −1
5  as follows:
Has she correctly marked the two points? How and why did she convert −1
2  to −5
and −1
5  to −2
10 ? She found that −1
5  is to the right of −1
2 . Thus, −1
5 >−1
2  or −1
2 <−1
Can you compare −3
4  and −2
3 ? −1
3  and −1
We know from our study of fractions that 1
5 < 1
2 . And what did Mary get for −1
and −1
5 ? Was it not exactly the opposite?
You will find that, 1
2 > 1
5  but −1
2 < −1
Do you observe the same for −3
4 , −2
3  and
Mary remembered that in integers she had studied  4 > 3
but – 4 < –3, 5 > 2 but –5 < –2 etc.
MATHEMATICS
z The case of pairs of negative rational numbers is similar. To compare two negative
rational numbers, we compare them ignoring their negative signs and then reverse
the order.
For example, to compare −7
5  and −5
3 , we first compare 7
5  and 5
We get 7
5  < 5
3  and conclude that
Take five more such pairs and compare them.
Which is greater −3
8  or −2
7 ?; −4
3  or −3
z Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious. A negative rational
number is to the left of zero whereas a positive rational number is to the right of zero on
a number line. So, a negative rational number will always be less than a positive rational
number.
Thus, 2
z To compare rational numbers −
reduce them to their standard forms and
then compare them.

− and −16
36  represent the same rational number?
SOLUTION
Yes, because 4
9.8 RATIONAL NUMBERS BETWEEN TWO RATIONAL NUMBERS
Reshma wanted to count the whole numbers between 3 and 10. From her earlier classes,
she knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly, she
wanted to know the total number of integers between –3 and 3. The integers between –3
and 3 are –2, –1, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between –3 and 3.
Are there any integers between –3 and –2? No, there is no integer between
–3 and –2. Between two successive integers the number of integers is 0.
RATIONAL NUMBERS
Thus, we find that number of integers between two integers are limited (finite).
Will the same happen in the case of rational numbers also?
Reshma took two rational numbers
She converted them to rational numbers with same denominators.
We have

PRACTICAL GEOMETRY
10.1  INTRODUCTION
You are familiar with a number of shapes. You learnt how to draw some of them in the earlier
classes. For example, you can draw a line segment of given length, a line perpendicular to a
given line segment, an angle, an angle bisector, a circle etc.
Now, you will learn how to draw parallel lines and some types of triangles.
10.2 CONSTRUCTION OF A LINE PARALLEL TO A GIVEN LINE,
THROUGH A POINT NOT ON THE LINE
Let us begin with an activity (Fig 10.1)
(i) Take a sheet of paper. Make a fold. This
fold represents a line l.
(ii) Unfold the paper. Mark a point A on the
paper outside l.
(iii) Fold the paper perpendicular to the line such
that this perpendicular passes through A.
Name the perpendicular AN.
(iv) Make a fold perpendicular to this
perpendicular through the point A. Name
the new perpendicular line as m. Now, l ||
m. Do you see ‘why’?

can help you here to say that lines l and m
are parallel.

You can use any one of the properties regarding the transversal and parallel lines to
make this construction using ruler and compasses only.
Step 1 Take a line ‘l’ and a point ‘A’ outside ‘l ’ [Fig10.2 (i)].
Step 2 Take any point B on l  and join B to A  [Fig 10.2(ii)].
Step 3 With B as centre and a convenient radius, draw an arc cutting l at C and BA at D
[Fig 10.2(iii)].
Step 4 Now with A as centre and the same radius as in Step 3, draw an arc EF cutting AB
at G [Fig 10.2 (iv)].

Step 5 Place the pointed tip of the compasses at C and adjust the opening so that the
pencil tip is at D [Fig 10.2 (v)].
Step 6 With the same opening as in Step 5 and with G as centre, draw an arc cutting the
arc EF at H [Fig 10.2 (vi)].
Step 7
Now, join AH to draw a line ‘m’ [Fig 10.2 (vii)].
Note that ∠ABC and ∠BAH are alternate interior angles.

parallel to the line l?

EXERCISE 10.1
1. Draw a line, say AB, take a point C outside it. Through C, draw a line parallel to AB
using ruler and compasses only.
2. Draw a line l. Draw a perpendicular to l at any point on l. On this perpendicular
choose a point X, 4 cm away from l. Through X, draw a line m parallel to l.
3. Let l be a line and P be a point not on l. Through P, draw a line m parallel to l. Now
join P to any point Q on l. Choose any other point R on m. Through R, draw a line
parallel to PQ. Let this meet l at S. What shape do the two sets of parallel lines enclose?
10.3  CONSTRUCTION OF TRIANGLES
It is better for you to go through this section after recalling ideas
on triangles, in particular, the chapters on properties of triangles
and congruence of triangles.
You know how triangles are classified based on sides or
angles and the following important properties concerning triangles:
(i) The exterior angle of a triangle is equal in measure to the
sum of interior opposite angles.
(ii) The total measure of the three angles of a triangle is 180°.
(iii) Sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater
than the length of the third side.
(iv) In any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two
sides.
In the chapter on ‘Congruence of Triangles’, we saw that a triangle can be drawn if any
one of the following sets of measurements are given:
(i) Three sides.
(ii) Two sides and the angle between them.
(iii) Two angles and the side between them.
(iv) The hypotenuse and a leg in the case of a right-angled triangle.
We will now attempt to use these ideas to construct triangles.
10.4 CONSTRUCTING A TRIANGLE WHEN THE LENGTHS OF
ITS THREE SIDES ARE KNOWN (SSS CRITERION)
In this section, we would construct triangles when all its sides are known. We draw first a
rough sketch to give an idea of where the sides are and then begin by drawing any one of
∠3 = ∠1 + ∠2
a+ b > c
∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180°
b2+ a2 = c2
PRACTICAL GEOMETRY
the three lines. See the following example:
EXAMPLE 1 Construct a triangle ABC, given that AB = 5 cm, BC = 6 cm and AC = 7 cm.
SOLUTION
Step 1 First, we draw a rough sketch with given measure, (This will help us in
deciding how to proceed) [Fig 10.3(i)].
Step 2 Draw a line segment BC of length 6 cm [Fig 10.3(ii)].
Step 3 From B, point A is at a distance of 5 cm. So, with B as centre, draw an arc of
radius 5 cm. (Now A will be somewhere on this arc. Our job is to find where
exactly A is) [Fig 10.3(iii)].
Step 4 From C, point A is at a distance of 7 cm. So, with C as centre, draw an arc of
radius 7 cm. (A will be somewhere on this arc, we have to fix it) [Fig 10.3(iv)].
(iii)
(Rough Sketch)
MATHEMATICS
Step 5 A has to be on both the arcs drawn. So, it is the point of intersection of arcs.
Mark the point of intersection of arcs as A. Join AB and AC. ΔABC is now ready
[Fig 10.3(v)].
Now, let us construct another triangle DEF such that DE = 5 cm, EF = 6 cm, and
DF = 7 cm. Take a cutout of ΔDEF and place it on ΔABC. What do we observe?
We observe that ΔDEF exactly coincides with ΔABC. (Note that the triangles have
been constructed when their three sides are given.) Thus, if three sides of one triangle are
equal to the corresponding three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are
congruent. This is SSS congruency rule which we have learnt in our earlier chapter.
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE

2 cm. But he could not get P. What is the reason? What property of
triangle do you know in connection with this problem?
Can such a triangle exist? (Remember the property of triangles
‘The sum of any two sides of a traingle is always greater than the
third side’!)

10.5 CONSTRUCTING A TRIANGLE WHEN THE LENGTHS OF TWO
SIDES AND THE MEASURE OF THE ANGLE BETWEEN THEM
ARE KNOWN. (SAS CRITERION)
Here, we have two sides given and the one angle between them. We first draw a sketch
and then draw one of the given line segments. The other steps follow. See Example 2.
EXAMPLE 2 Construct a triangle PQR, given
that PQ = 3 cm, QR = 5.5 cm
and ∠PQR = 60°.
SOLUTION
Step 1 First, we draw a rough sketch with
given measures. (This helps us
to determine the procedure in
construction) [Fig 10.5(i)].
Step 2 Draw a line segment QR of length
5.5 cm [Fig 10.5(ii)].
Step 3 At Q, draw QX making 60° with QR.
(The point P must be somewhere
on this ray of the angle)
[Fig 10.5(iii)].
Step 4 (To fix P, the distance QP has been
given).
With Q as centre, draw an arc of radius
3 cm. It cuts QX at the point P
[Fig 10.5(iv)].

MATHEMATICS
Step 5 Join PR. ΔPQR is now obtained (Fig 10.5(v)).
Let us now construct another triangle ABC such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 5.5 cm and
m∠ABC = 60°. Take a cut out of ΔABC and place it on ΔPQR.What do we observe?
We observe that ΔABC exactly coincides with ΔPQR. Thus, if two sides and the included
angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two sides and the included angle of
another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. This is SAS congruency rule which
we have learnt in our earlier chapter. (Note that the triangles have been constructed when
their two sides and the angle included between these two sides are given.)
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
In the above construction, lengths of two sides and measure of one angle were given. Now
study the following problems:
In ΔABC, if AB = 3cm, AC = 5 cm and m∠C = 30°. Can we draw this triangle? We
may draw AC = 5 cm and draw ∠C of measure 30°. CA is one arm of ∠C. Point B should
be lying on the other arm of ∠C. But, observe that point B cannot be located uniquely.
Therefore, the given data is not sufficient for construction of ΔABC.
Now, try to construct ΔABC if AB = 3cm, AC = 5 cm and m∠B = 30°. What do we
observe? Again, ΔABC cannot be constructed uniquely. Thus, we can conclude that a
unique triangle can be constructed only if the lengths of its two sides and the measure of the
included angle between them is given.

10.6 CONSTRUCTING A TRIANGLE WHEN THE MEASURES OF
TWO OF ITS ANGLES AND THE LENGTH OF THE SIDE
INCLUDED BETWEEN THEM IS GIVEN. (ASA CRITERION)
As before, draw a rough sketch. Now, draw the given line segment. Make angles on the
two ends. See the Example 3.
EXAMPLE 3 Construct ΔXYZ if it is given that XY = 6 cm,
m∠ZXY = 30° and m∠XYZ = 100°.
SOLUTION
Step 1 Before actual construction, we draw
a rough sketch with measures marked
on it. (This is just to get an idea as
how to proceed)
[Fig 10.6(i)].
Step 2 Draw XY of length 6 cm.
Step 3 At X, draw a ray XP making an angle
of 30° with XY. By the given condition
Z must be somewhere on the XP.
Step 4 At Y, draw a ray YQ making an
angle of 100° with YX. By the
given condition, Z must be on the
ray YQ also.
Step 5 Z has to lie on both the rays XP and
YQ. So, the point of intersection of
the two rays is Z.
ΔXYZ is now completed.

MATHEMATICS
Now, draw another ΔLMN, where m∠NLM = 30°, LM = 6 cm and
m∠NML = 100°. Take a cutout of ΔLMN and place it on the ΔXYZ. We observe
that ΔLMN exactly coincides with ΔXYZ. Thus, if two angles and the included
side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and the included side
of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. This is ASA congruency
rule which you have learnt in the earlier chapter. (Note that the triangles have been
constructed when two angles and the included side between these angles are given.)
THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
In the above example, length of a side and measures of two angles were given. Now study
the following problem:
In ΔABC, if AC = 7 cm, m∠A = 60° and m∠B = 50°, can you draw the triangle?

m∠F = 80°. Justify your answer.

LENGTH OF ONE LEG AND ITS HYPOTENUSE ARE GIVEN

Here it is easy to make the rough sketch. Now, draw a line as per the given side.
Make a right angle on one of its points. Use compasses to mark length of side and
hypotenuse of the triangle. Complete the triangle. Consider the following:
EXAMPLE 4 Construct ΔLMN, right-angled at M, given that LN = 5 cm and
MN = 3 cm.

(L must be on this arc, since it is at a distance
of 5 cm from N) [Fig 10.7(iv)].
Step 5 L has to be on the perpendicular line MX
as well as on the arc drawn with centre N.
Therefore, L is the meeting point of these
ΔLMN is now obtained.

In this Chapter, we looked into the methods of some ruler and compasses constructions.

We could also have used the idea of ‘equal corresponding angles’ to do the
construction.

PERIMETER AND AREA
11.1  INTRODUCTION
In Class VI, you have already learnt perimeters of plane figures and areas of squares and
rectangles. Perimeter is the distance around a closed figure while area is the part of plane or
region occupied by the closed figure.
In this class, you will learn about perimeters and areas of a few more plane figures.
11.2  SQUARES AND RECTANGLES
Ayush and Deeksha made pictures. Ayush made his picture on a rectangular sheet of length
60 cm and breadth 20 cm while Deeksha made hers on a rectangular sheet of length 40 cm
and breadth 35 cm. Both these pictures have to be separately framed and laminated.
Who has to pay more for framing, if the cost of framing is ` 3.00 per cm?
If the cost of lamination is ` 2.00 per cm2, who has to pay more for lamination?
For finding the cost of framing, we need to find perimeter and then multiply it by the rate
for framing. For finding the cost of lamination, we need to find area and then multiply it by the
rate for lamination.
What would you need to find, area or perimeter, to answer the following?
1. How much space does a blackboard occupy?
2. What is the length of a wire required to fence a rectangular flower bed?
3. What distance would you cover by taking two rounds of a triangular park?
4. How much plastic sheet do you need to cover a rectangular swimming pool?

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (l + b)
Area of a rectangle = l × b, Area of a square = side × side
Tanya needed a square of side 4 cm for completing a collage. She had a
rectangular sheet of length 28 cm and breadth 21 cm (Fig 11. 1). She cuts off
a square of side 4 cm from the rectangular sheet. Her friend saw the remaining
sheet (Fig 11.2) and asked Tanya, “Has the perimeter of the sheet  increased
or decreased now?”
Has the total length of side AD increased after cutting off the square?
Has the area increased or decreased?
Tanya cuts off one more square from the opposite side (Fig 11.3).
Will the perimeter of the remaining sheet increase further?
Will the area increase or decrease further?
So, what can we infer from this?
It is clear that the increase of perimeter need not lead to increase in area.
1. Experiment with several such shapes and cut-outs. You might find it useful to draw
these shapes on squared sheets and compute their areas and perimeters.
You have seen that increase in perimeter does not mean that area will also increase.
2. Give two examples where the area increases as the perimeter increases.
3. Give two examples where the area does not increase when perimeter increases.
EXAMPLE 1 A door-frame of dimensions 3 m × 2 m is fixed on the wall of dimension
10 m × 10 m. Find the total labour charges for painting the wall if the
labour charges for painting 1 m2 of the wall is ` 2.50.
SOLUTION
Painting of the wall has to be done excluding the area of the door.
Area of the door = l × b
= 3 × 2 m2  = 6 m2
Area of wall including door = side × side = 10 m × 10 m = 100 m2
Area of wall excluding door = (100 − 6) m2 = 94 m2
Total labour charges for painting the wall = ` 2.50 × 94 = ` 235
EXAMPLE 2 The area of a rectangular sheet is 500 cm2. If the length of the sheet is
25 cm, what is its width? Also find the perimeter of the rectangular sheet.
SOLUTION
Area of the rectangular sheet  = 500 cm2
Length (l) = 25 cm

PERIMETER AND AREA
Area of the rectangle = l × b  (where  b = width of the sheet)
Therefore, width b = Area
= 500
25  = 20 cm
Perimeter of sheet = 2 × (l + b) = 2 × (25 + 20) cm = 90 cm
So, the width of the rectangular sheet is 20 cm and its perimeter is 90 cm.
EXAMPLE 3 Anu wants to fence the garden in front of her
house (Fig 11.5), on three sides with lengths
20 m, 12 m and 12 m. Find the cost of fencing
at the rate of ` 150 per metre.
SOLUTION
The length of the fence required is the perimeter
of the garden (excluding one side) which is
equal to 20 m + 12 m + 12 m, i.e.,  44 m.
Cost of fencing = ` 150 × 44 = ` 6,600.
EXAMPLE 4 A wire is in the shape of a square of side 10 cm. If the wire is
rebent into a rectangle of length 12 cm, find its breadth. Which encloses
more area, the square or the rectangle?
SOLUTION
Side of the square = 10 cm
Length of the wire = Perimeter of the square = 4 × side = 4 × 10 cm
= 40 cm
Length of the rectangle, l = 12 cm. Let b be the breadth of the rectangle.
Perimeter of rectangle = Length of wire = 40 cm
Perimeter of the rectangle = 2 (l + b)
Thus,
40 = 2 (12 + b)
2  = 12 + b
Therefore,
b = 20 − 12 = 8 cm
The breadth of the rectangle is 8 cm.
Area of the square = (side)2
= 10 cm × 10 cm = 100 cm2
Area of the rectangle = l × b
= 12 cm × 8 cm = 96 cm2
So, the square encloses more area even though its perimeter is the same as that of the rectangle.
EXAMPLE 5The area of a square and a rectangle are equal. If the side of the square is
40 cm and the breadth of the rectangle is 25 cm, find the length of the
rectangle. Also, find the perimeter of the rectangle.
SOLUTION
Area of square = (side)2
= 40 cm × 40 cm = 1600 cm2
Fig 11.5
MATHEMATICS
It is given that,
The area of the rectangle = The area of the square
Area of the rectangle = 1600 cm2, breadth of the rectangle = 25 cm.
Area of the rectangle = l × b
1600 = l × 25
25  = l
l = 64 cm
So, the length of rectangle is 64 cm.
Perimeter of the rectangle = 2 (l + b) = 2 (64 + 25) cm
= 2 × 89 cm = 178 cm
So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 178 cm even though its area is the same as that of
the square.

How will you find the area of a land which is a parallelogram in shape?
Let us find a method to get the area of a parallelogram.
Can a parallelogram be converted into a rectangle of equal area?
Draw a parallelogram on a graph paper as shown in Fig 11.10(i). Cut out the
parallelogram. Draw a line from one vertex of the parallelogram perpendicular to the
opposite side [Fig 11.10(ii)]. Cut out the triangle. Move the triangle to the other side of
the parallelogram.

What shape do you get? You get a rectangle.
Is the area of the parallelogram equal to the area of the rectangle formed?
Yes, area of the parallelogram = area of the rectangle formed
What are the length and the breadth of the rectangle?
We find that the length of the rectangle formed is equal to the
base of the parallelogram and the breadth of the rectangle is equal to
the height of the parallelogram (Fig 11.11).
Area of parallelogram = Area of rectangle
= length × breadth = l × b
But the length l and breadth b of the  rectangle are exactly the
base b and the height h, respectively of the parallelogram.
Thus, the area of parallelogram = base × height = b × h.
Fig 11.11
PERIMETER AND AREA
Any side of a parallelogram can be chosen as base of the
parallelogram. The perpendicular dropped on that side from the opposite
vertex is known as height (altitude). In the parallelogram ABCD, DE is
perpendicular to AB.  Here AB is the
base and DE is the height of the
parallelogram.
In this parallelogram ABCD, BF is the
perpendicular to opposite side AD. Here AD is the
base and BF is the height.
Consider the following parallelograms (Fig 11.12).

Superpose one triangle on the other so that they match.
You may have to rotate one of the two triangles.
Now place both the triangles such that their corresponding
sides are joined (as shown in Fig 11.14).
Is the figure thus formed a parallelogram?
Compare the area of each triangle to the area of the
parallelogram.
Compare the base and height of the triangles with the base
and height of the parallelogram.
You will find that the sum of the areas of both the triangles
is equal to the area of the parallelogram. The base and the
height of the triangle are the same as the base and the height of
the parallelogram, respectively.

parallelogram are 4 cm and 3 cm respectively. Find the
area of the parallelogram (Fig 11.17).

Area of the parallelogram = b × h
= 4 cm × 3 cm = 12 cm2
EXAMPLE 7 Find the height ‘x’ if the area of the
parallelogram is 24 cm2 and the base is
4 cm.
SOLUTION  Area of parallelogram = b × h
Therefore, 24 = 4 × x (Fig 11.18)
4  = x
x = 6 cm
So, the height of the parallelogram is 6 cm.
EXAMPLE 8 The two sides of the parallelogram ABCD are 6 cm and 4 cm. The height

SOLUTION
Area of parallelogram = b × h
= 6 cm × 3 cm = 18 cm2
base (b) = 4 cm,  height = x (say),
Area = 18 cm2
Area of parallelogram = b × x
18 = 4 × x
4  = x
Therefore,
x = 4.5 cm
Thus, the height corresponding to base AD is 4.5 cm.

to decorate these cards. What length of the lace does she require for each? (Fig 11.28)
Fig 11.28
You cannot measure the curves with the help of a ruler, as these figures are not “straight”.
What can you do?
Here is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in Fig 11.28(a). Mark a
point on the edge of the card and place the card on the table. Mark the position of the
point on the table also (Fig 11. 29).
Now roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till
the marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance
along the line. This is the length of the lace required
(Fig 11.30). It is also the distance along the edge of the card
from the marked point back to the marked point.
You can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge
of the circular object and taking all round it.
The distance around a circular region is known as its circumference.
Take a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference.
Now, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method?
Still, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular
object by measuring through string. Moreover, the measurement will not be accurate.
So, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes.
Let us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of
the circles.
Consider the following table: Draw six circles of different radii and find their circumference
by using string. Also find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter.

What do you infer from the above table? Is this ratio approximately the same? Yes.
Can you say that the circumference of a circle is always more than three times its
diameter? Yes.
This ratio is a constant and is denoted by π (pi). Its approximate value is 22
7  or 3.14.
So, we can say that  C
d = π , where ‘C’ represents circumference of the circle and ‘d’
its diameter.
C = πd
We know that diameter (d) of a circle is twice the radius (r) i.e., d = 2r
C = πd = π × 2r
C = 2πr.

EXAMPLE 12 What is the circumference of a circle of diameter 10 cm (Take π = 3.14)?
SOLUTION
Diameter of the circle (d) = 10 cm

So, the circumference of the circle of diameter 10 cm is 31.4 cm.
EXAMPLE 13  What is the circumference of a circular disc of radius 14 cm?

Radius of circular disc (r) = 14 cm

So, the circumference of the circular disc is 88 cm.
EXAMPLE 14 The radius of a circular pipe is 10 cm. What length of a tape is required

SOLUTION
Radius of the pipe (r) = 10 cm
Length of tape required is equal to the circumference of the pipe.
Circumference of the pipe = 2πr
= 2 × 3.14 × 10 cm
= 62.8 cm
Therefore, length of the tape needed to wrap once around the pipe is 62.8 cm.
EXAMPLE 15 Find the perimeter of the given shape (Fig 11.32) (Take π = 22

In this shape we need to find the circumference of semicircles on each side

The outer boundary, of this figure is made up of semicircles. Diameter of
each semicircle is 14 cm.
We know that:
Circumference of the circle = πd
Circumference of the  semicircle = 1

Circumference of each of the semicircles is 22 cm
Therefore, perimeter of the given figure = 4 × 22 cm  = 88 cm

(i) Circumference of semicircular shape
(ii) Diameter
Given that radius (r) = 7 cm. We know that the circumference of circle = 2πr
the circumference of the semicircle = 1
r  = πr
cm  = 22 cm
the diameter of the circle = 2r = 2 × 7 cm = 14 cm
Thus,
perimeter of each semicircular disc = 22 cm + 14 cm = 36 cm
11.5.2  Area of Circle
Consider the following:
z A farmer dug a flower bed of radius 7 m at the centre of a field. He needs to
purchase fertiliser. If 1 kg of fertiliser is required for 1 square metre area,
how much  fertiliser should he purchase?
z What will be the cost of polishing a circular table-top of radius 2 m at the rate
of ` 10 per square metre?
Can you tell what we need to find in such cases, Area or Perimeter? In such
cases we need to find the area of the circular region. Let us find the area of a circle, using
graph paper.
Draw a circle of radius 4 cm on a graph paper (Fig 11.34). Find the area by counting
the number of squares enclosed.
As the edges are not straight, we get a rough estimate of the area of circle by this method.
There is another way of finding the area of a circle.
Draw a circle and shade one half of the circle [Fig 11.35(i)]. Now fold the circle into
eighths and cut along the folds [Fig 11.35(ii)].
Fig 11.33
Fig 11.34
Arrange the separate pieces as shown, in Fig 11.36,  which is roughly a parallelogram.
The more sectors we have, the nearer we reach an appropriate parallelogram.
Fig 11.35
Fig 11.36
MATHEMATICS
As done above if we divide the circle in 64 sectors, and arrange these sectors. It
gives nearly a rectangle (Fig 11.37).
Fig 11.37
What is the breadth of this rectangle? The breadth of this rectangle is the radius of the
circle, i.e., ‘r’.
As the whole circle is divided into 64 sectors and on each side we have 32 sectors, the
length of the rectangle is the length of the 32 sectors, which is half of the circumference.
(Fig 11.37)
Area of the circle = Area of rectangle thus formed = l × b
= (Half of circumference) × radius  = 1
⎠⎟× r = πr2
So, the area of the circle = πr2
Draw circles of different radii on a graph paper. Find the area by counting the
number of squares. Also find the area by using the formula. Compare the two answers.
EXAMPLE 17 Find the area of a circle of radius 30 cm (use π = 3.14).

11.6  CONVERSION OF UNITS
We know that 1 cm = 10 mm. Can you tell 1 cm2 is equal to how many mm2? Let us explore
similar questions and find how to convert units while measuring areas to another unit.
Draw a square of side 1cm (Fig 11.38), on a graph sheet.
You find that this square of side 1 cm will be divided into 100 squares, each of side 1 mm.
Area of a square of side 1cm = Area of 100 squares, of each side 1mm.
Therefore,
1 cm2 = 100 × 1 mm2
1 cm2 = 100 mm2
Similarly,
1 m2 = 1 m × 1 m
= 100 cm × 100 cm   (As 1 m = 100 cm)
= 10000 cm2
Now can you convert 1 km2 into m2?
In the metric system, areas of land are also measured in hectares [written “ha” in short].
A square of side 100 m has an area of 1 hectare.
1 hectare = 100 × 100 m2 = 10,000 m2
When we convert a unit of area to a smaller unit, the resulting number of units will
be bigger.
For example,
1000 cm2 = 1000 × 100 mm2
= 100000 mm2
Fig 11.38
PERIMETER AND AREA
But when we convert a unit of area to a larger unit, the number of larger units will be
smaller.
For example,
1000 cm2 = 1000
10000 m2 = 0.1 m2
Convert the following:
(i) 50 cm2 in mm2
(ii) 2  ha in m2
(iii) 10 m2 in cm2
(iv) 1000 cm2 in m2
11.7  APPLICATIONS
You must have observed that quite often, in gardens or parks, some space is left all around
in the form of path or in between as cross paths. A framed picture has some space left all
around it.
We need to find the areas of such pathways or borders when
we want to find the cost of making them.
EXAMPLE 20 A rectangular park is 45 m long and 30 m wide.
A path 2.5 m wide is constructed outside the
park. Find the area of  the path.
SOLUTION
Let ABCD represent the rectangular park and
the shaded region represent the path 2.5 m wide.
To find the area of the path, we need to find (Area of rectangle
PQRS – Area of rectangle ABCD).
We have,
PQ = (45 + 2.5 + 2.5) m = 50 m
PS = (30 + 2.5 + 2.5) m = 35 m
Area of the rectangle ABCD = l × b  = 45 × 30 m2 = 1350 m2
Area of the rectangle PQRS = l × b = 50 × 35 m2 = 1750 m2
Area of the path = Area of the rectangle PQRS − Area of the rectangle ABCD
= (1750 − 1350) m2 = 400 m2
EXAMPLE 21 A path 5 m wide runs along inside a square park of side
100 m. Find the area of the path. Also find the cost of
cementing it at the rate of  ` 250 per 10 m2.
SOLUTION
Let ABCD be the square park of side 100 m. The
shaded region represents the path 5 m wide.
PQ = 100 – (5 + 5) = 90 m
Area of square ABCD = (side)2  = (100)2 m2  = 10000 m2
Area of square PQRS = (side)2 = (90)2 m2 = 8100 m2
Therefore, area of the path = (10000 − 8100) m2 = 1900 m2
Cost of cementing 10 m2 = ` 250

MATHEMATICS
Therefore, cost of cementing 1 m2 = ` 250
cost of cementing 1900 m2 = ` 250
= ` 47,500
EXAMPLE 22 Two cross roads, each of width 5 m, run at right angles through the centre
of a rectangular park of  length 70 m and breadth 45 m and parallel to its
sides. Find the area of the roads. Also find the cost of constructing the
roads at the rate of  ` 105 per m2.
SOLUTION
Area of the cross roads is the area of shaded portion, i.e., the area of
the rectangle PQRS and the area of the rectangle EFGH. But while
doing this, the area of the square KLMN is taken twice,
which is to be subtracted.
PQ = 5 m and PS = 45 m
EH = 5 m and  EF = 70 m
KL = 5 m and KN = 5 m
Area of the path = Area of the rectangle PQRS + area of
the rectangle EFGH – Area of the square KLMN
= PS × PQ + EF × EH – KL × KN
= (45 × 5 + 70 × 5 − 5 × 5) m2
= (225 + 350 − 25) m2  = 550 m2
Cost of constructing the path = ` 105 × 550 = ` 57,750

occupied by the closed figure.
2. We have learnt how to find perimeter and area of a square and rectangle in the earlier
class. They are:
(a) Perimeter of a square = 4 × side
(b) Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth)
(c) Area of a square = side × side
(d) Area of a rectangle = length × breadth

or 3.14 (approximately).

7. Based on the conversion of units for lengths, studied earlier, the units of areas can
also be converted:
1 cm2 = 100 mm2,
1 m2 = 10000 cm2 ,
1 hectare = 10000 m2.
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
12.1  INTRODUCTION
We have already come across simple algebraic expressions like x + 3,  y – 5, 4x + 5,
10y – 5 and so on. In Class VI, we have seen how these expressions are useful in formulating
puzzles and problems. We have also seen examples of several expressions in the chapter on
simple equations.
Expressions are a central concept in algebra. This Chapter is devoted to algebraic
expressions. When you have studied this Chapter, you will know how algebraic
expressions are formed, how they can be combined, how we can find their values and
how they can be used.
12.2  HOW ARE EXPRESSIONS FORMED?
We now know very well what a variable is. We use letters x, y, l, m, ... etc. to denote
variables. A variable can take various values. Its value is not fixed. On the other hand, a
constant has a fixed value. Examples of constants are: 4, 100, –17, etc.
We combine variables and constants to make algebraic expressions. For this, we use the
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We have already come across
expressions like 4x + 5, 10y – 20. The expression 4x + 5 is obtained from the variable x, first
by multiplying x by the constant 4 and then adding the constant 5 to the product. Similarly,
10y – 20 is obtained by first multiplying y by 10 and then subtracting 20 from the product.
The above expressions were obtained by combining variables with constants. We can
also obtain expressions by combining variables with themselves or with other variables.
Look at how the following expressions are obtained:
x2, 2y2, 3x2 – 5, xy, 4xy + 7
(i) The expression x2 is obtained by multiplying the variable x by itself;
x × x = x2
Just as 4 × 4 is written as 42, we write x × x = x2. It is commonly read as x squared.
Chapter  12
Algebraic
Expressions
MATHEMATICS
(Later, when you study the chapter ‘Exponents and Powers’ you will realise that x2
may also be read as x raised to the power 2).
In the same manner, we can write
x × x × x = x3
Commonly, x3 is read as ‘x cubed’. Later, you will realise that x3 may also be read
as x raised to the power 3.
x, x2, x3, ... are all algebraic expressions obtained from x.
(ii) The expression 2y2 is obtained from y:
2y2 = 2 × y × y
Here by multiplying y with y we obtain y2 and then we multiply y2 by the constant 2.
(iii) In (3x2 – 5) we first obtain x2, and multiply it by 3 to get 3x2.
From 3x2, we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3x2 – 5.
(iv) In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus,
x × y = xy.
(v) In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4xy and add
7 to 4xy to get the expression.
12.3  TERMS OF AN EXPRESSION
We shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions
are formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms of an expression and
their factors are.
Consider the expression (4x + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x
separately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression
(3x2 + 7y). Here we first formed 3x2 separately as a product of 3, x and x. We then
formed 7y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3x2 and 7y separately, we
added them to get the expression.
You will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way. They
have parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression
which are formed separately first and then added are known as terms. Look at the
expression (4x2 – 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4x2 and –3xy. The term 4x2 is a
product of 4, x and x, and the term (–3xy) is a product of (–3), x and y.
Terms are added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x and 5 are added to
form the expression (4x + 5), the terms 4x2 and (–3xy) are added to give the expression
(4x2 – 3xy). This is because 4x2 + (–3xy) = 4x2 – 3xy.
Note, the minus sign (–)  is included in the term. In the expression 4x2 –3xy, we
took the term as (–3xy) and not as (3xy). That is why we do not need to say that
terms are ‘added or subtracted’ to form an expression; just ‘added’ is enough.
Factors of a term
We saw above that the expression (4x2 – 3xy) consists of two terms 4x2 and –3xy. The
term 4x2 is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4x2.
A term is a product of its factors. The term –3xy is a product of the factors –3, x and y.
Describe how the
following expressions
are obtained:
7xy + 5, x2y, 4x2 – 5x
TRY THESE
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
We can represent the terms and factors of
the terms of an expression conveniently and
elegantly by a tree diagram. The tree for the
expression (4x2 – 3xy) is as shown in the
adjacent figure.
Note, in the tree diagram, we have used
dotted lines for factors and continuous lines for
terms. This is to avoid mixing them.
Let us draw a tree diagram for the expression
5xy + 10.
The factors are such that they cannot be
further factorised. Thus we do not write 5xy as
5 × xy, because xy can be further factorised.
Similarly, if x3 were a term, it would be written as
x × x × x and not x2 × x. Also, remember that
1 is not taken as a separate factor.
Coefficients
We have learnt how to write a term as a product of factors.
One of these factors may be numerical and the others algebraic
(i.e., they contain variables). The numerical factor is said to be
the numerical coefficient or simply the coefficient of the term.
It is also said to be the coefficient of the rest of the term (which
is obviously the product of algebraic factors of the term). Thus
in 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of the term. It is also the coefficient
of xy. In the term 10xyz, 10 is the coefficient of xyz, in the
term –7x2y2, –7 is the coefficient of x2y2.
When the coefficient of a term is +1, it is usually omitted.
For example, 1x is written as x; 1 x2y2 is written as x2y2 and
so on. Also, the coefficient (–1) is indicated only by the
minus sign. Thus (–1) x is written as – x; (–1) x 2 y 2 is
written as – x2 y2 and so on.
Sometimes, the word ‘coefficient’ is used in a more general way. Thus
we say that in the term 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of xy, x is the coefficient of 5y
and y is the coefficient of 5x. In 10xy2, 10 is the coefficient of xy2, x is the
coefficient of 10y2 and y2 is the coefficient of 10x. Thus, in this more general
way, a coefficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or
a product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the
product of the remaining factors.

constants. Give their numerical coefficients:

12.4  LIKE AND UNLIKE TERMS
When terms have the same algebraic factors, they are like terms. When terms have different
algebraic factors, they are unlike terms. For example, in the expression 2xy – 3x + 5xy – 4,
look at the terms 2xy and 5xy. The factors of 2xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5xy are 5,
x and y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
hence they are like terms. On the other hand the
terms 2xy and –3x, have different algebraic factors.
They are unlike terms. Similarly, the terms, 2xy
and 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms –3x and 4
are unlike terms.
12.5 MONOMIALS, BINOMIALS, TRINOMIALS AND
POLYNOMIALS
An expression with only one term is called a monomial; for example, 7xy, – 5m,
3z2, 4 etc.
An expression which contains two unlike terms is called a
binomial; for example, x + y, m – 5, mn + 4m, a2 – b2 are
binomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a
monomial. The expression (a + b + 5) is not a binomial.
It contains three terms.
An expression which contains three terms is called a
trinomial; for example, the expressions x + y + 7, ab + a +b,
3x2 – 5x + 2, m + n + 10 are trinomials. The expression
ab + a + b + 5 is, however not a trinomial; it contains four
terms and not three. The expression x +  y + 5x is not a trinomial as the terms x and 5x are
like terms.
In general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a
monomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.

terms and which are of unlike terms:

or unlike terms:

(iii) Next, check the powers of each variable in the terms. They must be the same.

coefficients of the terms and (2) the order in which the variables are multiplied in the
terms.

EXPRESSIONS
Consider the following problems:
1. Sarita has some marbles. Ameena has 10 more. Appu says that he has 3 more
marbles than the number of marbles Sarita and Ameena together have. How do you
get the number of marbles that Appu has?
Since it is not given how many marbles Sarita has, we shall take it to be x. Ameena
then has 10 more, i.e., x + 10. Appu says that he has 3 more marbles than what
Sarita and Ameena have together. So we take the sum of the numbers of Sarita’s
MATHEMATICS
marbles and Ameena’s marbles, and to this sum add 3, that is, we take the sum of
x, x + 10 and 3.
2. Ramu’s father’s present age is 3 times Ramu’s age. Ramu’s grandfather’s age is 13
years more than the sum of Ramu’s age and Ramu’s father’s age. How do you find
Ramu’s grandfather’s age?
Since Ramu’s age is not given, let us take it to be y years. Then his father’s age is
3y years. To find Ramu’s grandfather’s age we have to take the sum of Ramu’s age (y)
and his father’s age (3y) and to the sum add 13, that is, we have to take the sum of
y, 3y and 13.
3. In a garden, roses and marigolds are planted in square plots. The length of the
square plot in which marigolds are planted is 3 metres greater than the length of the
square plot in which roses are planted. How much bigger in area is the marigold plot
than the rose plot?
Let us take l metres to be length of the side of the rose plot. The length of the side of
the marigold plot will be (l + 3) metres. Their respective areas will be l2 and (l + 3)2.
The difference between (l2 + 3)2  and l2 will decide how much bigger in area the
marigold plot is.
In all the three situations, we had to carry out addition or subtraction of algebraic
expressions. There are a number of real life problems in which we need to use
expressions and do arithmetic operations on them. In this section, we shall see how
algebraic expressions are added and subtracted.
Think of atleast two situations in each of which you need to form two algebraic
expressions and add or subtract them
Adding and subtracting like terms
The simplest expressions are monomials. They consist of only one term. To begin with we
shall learn how to add or subtract like terms.
z Let us add 3x and 4x. We know x is a number and so also are 3x and 4x.
3x + 4x = (3 × x) + (4 × x)
=  (3 + 4) × x    (using distributive law)
= 7 × x = 7x
3x + 4x = 7x
z Let us next add 8xy, 4xy and 2xy
8xy + 4xy + 2xy = (8 × xy) + (4 × xy) + (2 × xy)
= (8 + 4 + 2) × xy
= 14 × xy = 14xy
8xy + 4xy + 2xy = 14 xy
TRY THESE
Since variables are numbers, we can
use distributive law for them.
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
z Let us subtract 4n from 7n.
7n – 4n = (7 × n) – (4 × n)
= (7 – 4) × n = 3 × n = 3n
7n – 4n = 3n
z In the same way, subtract 5ab from 11ab.
11ab – 5ab = (11 – 5) ab = 6ab
Thus, the sum of two or more like terms is a like term with a numerical coefficient
equal to the sum of the numerical coefficients of all the like terms.
Similarly, the difference between two like terms is a like term with a numerical
coefficient equal to the difference between the numerical coefficients of the two
like terms.
Note, unlike terms cannot be added or subtracted the way like terms are added
or subtracted. We have already seen examples of this, when 5 is added to x, we write the
result as (x + 5). Observe that in (x + 5) both the terms 5 and x are retained.
Similarly, if we add the unlike terms 3xy and 7, the sum is 3xy + 7.
If we subtract 7 from 3xy, the result is 3xy – 7
Adding and subtracting general algebraic expressions
Let us take some examples:
z Add 3x + 11 and 7x – 5
The sum = 3x + 11 + 7x – 5
Now, we know that the terms 3x and 7x are like terms and so also are 11 and – 5.
Further 3x + 7x = 10 x and 11 + (– 5) = 6. We can, therefore, simplify the sum as:
The sum = 3x + 11 + 7x – 5
= 3x + 7x + 11 – 5
(rearranging terms)
= 10x + 6
Hence, 3x + 11 + 7x – 5 = 10x + 6
z Add 3x + 11 + 8z and 7x – 5.
The sum = 3x + 11 + 8z + 7x – 5
= 3x + 7x + 11 – 5 + 8z (rearranging terms)
Note we have put like terms together; the single unlike term 8z will remain as it is.
Therefore, the sum = 10x + 6 + 8z
MATHEMATICS
z Subtract a – b from 3a – b + 4
The difference = 3a – b + 4 – (a – b)
= 3a – b + 4 – a + b
Observe how we took (a – b) in brackets and took
care of signs in opening the bracket. Rearranging the
terms to put like terms together,
The difference = 3a – a + b – b + 4
= (3 – 1) a + (1 – 1) b + 4
The difference = 2a + (0) b + 4 = 2a + 4
3a – b + 4 – (a – b) = 2a + 4
We shall now solve some more examples on addition and subtraction of expression
for practice.
EXAMPLE 4 Collect like terms and simplify the expression:
12m2 – 9m + 5m – 4m2 – 7m + 10
SOLUTION
Rearranging terms, we have
12m2 – 4m2 + 5m – 9m – 7m + 10
= (12 – 4) m2 + (5 – 9 – 7) m + 10
= 8m2 + (– 4 – 7) m + 10
= 8m2 + (–11) m + 10
= 8m2 – 11m + 10
EXAMPLE 5 Subtract 24ab – 10b – 18a from 30ab + 12b + 14a.
SOLUTION
30ab + 12b + 14a – (24ab – 10b – 18a)
= 30ab + 12b + 14a – 24ab + 10b + 18a
= 30ab – 24ab + 12b + 10b + 14a + 18a
= 6ab + 22b + 32a
Alternatively, we write the expressions one below the other with the like
terms appearing exactly below like terms as:
30ab + 12b + 14a
24ab  – 10b – 18a
+        +
6ab + 22b + 32a
TRY THESE
Add and subtract
(i) m – n, m + n
(ii) mn + 5 – 2, mn + 3
Note, subtracting a term
is the same as adding its
inverse. Subtracting –10b
is the same as adding
+10b; Subtracting
–18a is the same as
adding 18a and subtrac-
ting 24ab is the same as
adding – 24ab. The
signs shown below the
expression to be subtrac-
ted are a help in carrying
out the subtraction
properly.
Note, just as
– (5 – 3)  = – 5 + 3,
– (a – b) = – a + b.
The signs of algebraic
terms are handled in the
same way as signs of
numbers.

12.7  FINDING THE VALUE OF AN EXPRESSION
We know that the value of an algebraic expression depends on the values of the variables
forming the expression. There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value
of an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable
satisfies a given equation or not.
We find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from
everyday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is l2, where l is the length of a
side of the square. If l =  5 cm., the area is 52 cm2 or 25 cm2; if the side is 10 cm, the area
is 102 cm2 or 100 cm2 and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the values of the following expressions for x = 2.
(i) x + 4
(ii) 4x – 3
(iii) 19 – 5x2
(iv) 100 – 10x3
SOLUTION
Putting x = 2
(i) In x + 4, we get the value of x + 4, i.e.,
x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
(ii) In 4x – 3, we get
4x – 3 = (4 × 2) – 3 = 8 – 3 = 5
(iii) In 19 – 5x2, we get
19 – 5x2 = 19 – (5 × 22) = 19 – (5 × 4) = 19 – 20 = – 1
(iv) In 100 – 10x3, we get
100 – 10x3 = 100 – (10 × 23) = 100 – (10 × 8) (Note 23 = 8)
= 100 – 80 = 20
EXAMPLE 8 Find the value of the following expressions when n =  – 2.
(i) 5n – 2
(ii) 5n2 + 5n – 2
(iii) n3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2
SOLUTION
(i) Putting the value of n = – 2, in 5n – 2, we get,
5(– 2) – 2 = – 10 – 2 = – 12
(ii) In 5n2 + 5n – 2, we have,
for n = –2, 5n – 2 = –12
and 5n2 = 5 × (– 2)2 = 5 × 4 = 20
[as (– 2)2 = 4]
Combining,
5n2 + 5n – 2 = 20 – 12 = 8
(iii) Now, for n = – 2,
5n2 + 5n – 2 = 8 and
n3 = (–2)3 = (–2) × (–2) × (–2) = – 8
Combining,
n3 + 5n2 + 5n – 2 = – 8 + 8 = 0
We shall now consider expressions of two variables, for example, x + y, xy. To work
out the numerical value of an expression of two variables, we need to give the values of
both variables. For example, the value of (x + y), for x = 3 and y = 5, is 3 + 5 = 8.
EXAMPLE 9 Find the value of the following expressions for a = 3, b = 2.
(i) a + b
(ii) 7a – 4b
(iii) a2 + 2ab + b2
(iv) a3 – b3
SOLUTION
Substituting a = 3 and b = 2 in
(i) a + b, we get
a + b = 3 + 2 = 5
MATHEMATICS
(ii) 7a – 4b, we get
7a – 4b = 7 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 21 – 8 = 13.
(iii) a2 + 2ab + b2,  we get
a2 + 2ab + b2 = 32 + 2 × 3 × 2 + 22 = 9 + 2 × 6 + 4 = 9 + 12 + 4 = 25
(iv) a3 – b3, we get
a3 – b3 = 33 – 23 = 3 × 3 × 3 – 2 × 2 × 2 = 9 × 3 – 4 × 2 = 27 – 8 = 19

ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
12.8 USING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS – FORMULAS AND
RULES
We have seen earlier also that formulas and rules in mathematics can be written in a concise
and general form using algebraic expressions. We see below several examples.
z Perimeter formulas
1. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 × the length of its side. If we denote the
length of the side of the equilateral triangle by l, then the perimeter of the equilateral
triangle = 3l
2. Similarly, the perimeter of a square = 4l
where l = the length of the side of the square.
3. Perimeter of a regular pentagon = 5l
where l = the length of the side of the pentagon and so on.
z Area formulas
1. If we denote the length of a square by l, then the area of the square = l2
2. If we denote the length of a rectangle by l and its breadth by b, then the area of the
rectangle = l × b = lb.
3. Similarly, if b stands for the base and h for the height of a triangle, then the area of the
triangle = b
Once a formula, that is, the algebraic expression for a given quantity is known, the
value of the quantity can be computed as required.
For example, for a square of length 3 cm, the perimeter is obtained by putting the value
l = 3 cm in the expression of the perimeter of a square, i.e., 4l.
The perimeter of the given square = (4 × 3) cm = 12 cm.
Similarly, the area of the square is obtained by putting in the value of
l (= 3 cm) in the expression for the area of a square, that is, l2;
Area of the given square = (3)2 cm2 = 9 cm2.
z Rules for number patterns
Study the following statements:
1. If a natural number is denoted by n, its successor is (n + 1). We can check this for
any natural number. For example, if n = 10, its successor is n + 1=11, which is
known.
MATHEMATICS
2. If a natural number is denoted by n, 2n is an even number and (2n + 1) an odd
number. Let us check it for any number, say, 15; 2n = 2 × n = 2 × 15 = 30 is indeed
an even number and 2n + 1 = 2 × 15 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31 is indeed an odd number.
Take (small) line segments of equal length such as matchsticks, tooth pricks or
pieces of straws cut into smaller pieces of equal length. Join them in patterns as
shown in the figures given:
1. Observe the pattern in Fig 12.1.
It consists of repetitions of the shape
made from 4 line segments. As you see for
one shape you need 4 segments, for two
shapes 7, for three 10 and so on. If n is the
number of shapes, then the number of
segments required to form n shapes is given
by (3n + 1).
You may verify this by taking n = 1, 2,
3, 4, ..., 10, ... etc. For example, if the
number of letters formed is 3, then
the number of line segments required
is 3 × 3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10, as seen from
the figure.
2. Now, consider the pattern in Fig 12.2. Here
the shape
is repeated. The number of
segments required to form 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
shapes are 3, 5, 7, 9, ... respectively. If n
stands for the shapes formed, the number of
segments required is given by the expression
(2n + 1). You may check if the expression is
correct by taking any value of n, say n = 4.
Then (2n + 1) = (2 × 4) + 1 = 9, which is
indeed the number of line segments
required to make 4
DO THIS

ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
Make similar pattern with basic figures as shown
(The number of segments required to make the figure is given to the right. Also,
the expression for the number of segments required to make n shapes is also given).
Go ahead and discover more such patterns.
Make the following pattern of dots. If you take a graph paper or a dot paper, it will
be easier to make the patterns.
Observe how the dots are arranged in a square shape. If the number of dots in a
row or a column in a particular figure is taken to be the variable n, then the number of
dots in the figure is given by the expression n × n = n2. For example, take n = 4. The
number of dots for the figure with 4 dots in a row (or a column) is 4 × 4 = 16, as is
indeed seen from the figure. You may check this for other values of n. The ancient
Greek mathematicians called the number 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... square numbers.
z Some more number patterns
Let us now look at another pattern of numbers, this time without any drawing to help us
3, 6, 9, 12, ..., 3n, ...
The numbers are such that they are multiples of 3 arranged in an increasing order,
beginning with 3. The term which occurs at the nth position is given by the expression 3n.
You can easily find the term which occurs in the 10th position (which is 3 × 10 = 30);
100th position (which is 3 × 100 = 300) and so on.
z Pattern in geometry

Check it, it is one.

MATHEMATICS
From one vertex of a pentagon? Check it, it is 2.
From one vertex of a hexagon? It is 3.
The number of diagonals we can draw from one vertex of a polygon of n sides is
(n – 3). Check it for a heptagon (7 sides) and octagon (8 sides) by drawing figures.
What is the number for a triangle (3 sides)? Observe that the diagonals drawn from any
one vertex divide the polygon in as many non-overlapping triangles as the number of
diagonals that can be drawn from the vertex plus one.

such segmented digits on the display of electronic watches or calculators.

If the number of digits formed is taken to be n, the number of segments required to
form n digits is given by the algebraic expression appearing on the right of each pattern.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Algebraic expressions are formed from variables and constants. We use the
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the variables
and constants to form expressions. For example, the expression 4xy + 7 is formed
from the variables x and y and constants 4 and 7. The constant 4 and the variables
x and y are multiplied to give the product 4xy and the constant 7 is added to this
product to give the expression.
2. Expressions are made up of terms. Terms are added to make an expression. For
example, the addition of the terms 4xy and 7 gives the expression 4xy + 7.
3. A term is a product of factors. The term 4xy in the expression 4xy + 7 is a product
of factors x, y and 4. Factors containing variables are said to be algebraic factors.
4. The coefficient is the numerical factor in the term. Sometimes anyone factor in a
term is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term.
5. Any expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Specifically a one
term expression is called a monomial; a two-term expression is called a binomial;
and a three-term expression is called a trinomial.
6. Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. Terms which have different
algebraic factors are unlike terms. Thus, terms 4xy and – 3xy are like terms; but
terms 4xy and – 3x are not like terms.
7. The sum (or difference) of two like terms is a like term with coefficient equal to
the sum (or difference) of the coefficients of the two like terms. Thus,
8xy – 3xy = (8 – 3 )xy, i.e., 5xy.
8. When we add two algebraic expressions, the like terms are added as given
above; the unlike terms are left as they are. Thus, the sum of 4x2 + 5x
and 2x + 3 is 4x2 + 7x + 3; the like terms 5x and 2x add to 7x; the unlike
terms 4x2 and 3 are left as they are.
MATHEMATICS
9. In situations such as solving an equation and using a formula, we have to find the
value of an expression. The value of the expression depends on the value of the
variable from which the expression is formed. Thus, the value of 7x – 3 for x = 5 is
32, since 7(5) – 3 = 35 – 3 = 32.
10. Rules and formulas in mathematics are written in a concise and general form using
algebraic expressions:
Thus, the area of rectangle = lb, where l is the length and b is the breadth of the
rectangle.
The general (nth) term of a number pattern (or a sequence) is an expression in n.
Thus, the nth term of the number pattern 11, 21, 31, 41, . . . is (10n + 1).
EXPONENTS AND POWERS
13.1  INTRODUCTION
Do you know what the mass of earth is? It  is
5,970,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg!
Can you read this number?
Mass of Uranus is 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg.
Which has greater mass, Earth or Uranus?
Distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m and distance between Saturn
and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m. Can you read these numbers? Which distance is less?
These very large numbers are difficult to read, understand and compare. To make these
numbers easy to read, understand and compare, we use exponents. In this Chapter, we shall
learn about exponents and also learn how to use them.
13.2  EXPONENTS
We can write large numbers in a shorter form using exponents.
Observe
10, 000 = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 104
The short notation 104 stands for the product 10×10×10×10. Here ‘10’ is called the
base and ‘4’ the exponent. The number 104 is read as 10 raised to the power of 4 or
simply as fourth power of 10. 104 is called the exponential form of 10,000.
We can similarly express 1,000 as a power of 10. Since 1,000 is 10
multiplied by itself three  times,
1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 103
Here again, 103 is the exponential form of 1,000.
Similarly,
1,00,000 = 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 = 105
105 is the exponential form of 1,00,000
In both these examples, the base is 10; in case of 103, the exponent
is 3 and in case of 105 the exponent is 5.
Chapter  13
Exponents and
Powers
MATHEMATICS
We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000 etc., while writing numbers in an expanded
form. For example, 47561 = 4 × 10000 + 7 × 1000 + 5 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 1
This can be written as 4 × 104 + 7 ×103 + 5 × 102 + 6 × 10 + 1.
Try writing these numbers in the same way 172, 5642, 6374.
In all the above given examples, we have seen numbers whose base is 10. However
the base can be any other number also. For example:
81 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 can be written as 81 = 34, here 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent.
Some powers have special names. For example,
102, which is 10 raised to the power 2, also read as ‘10 squared’ and
103, which is 10 raised to the power 3, also read as ‘10 cubed’.
Can you tell what 53 (5 cubed) means?
53 means 5 is to be multiplied by itself three times, i.e., 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125
So, we can say 125 is the third power of 5.
What is the exponent and the base in 53?
Similarly, 25  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 =  32,
which is the fifth power of 2.
In 25, 2 is the base and 5 is the exponent.
In the same way,
243 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 35
64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 26
625 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 54
Find five more such examples, where a number is expressed in exponential form.
Also identify the base and the exponent in each case.
You can also extend this way of writing when the base is a negative integer.
What does (–2)3 mean?
It is
(–2)3 = (–2) ×  (–2) ×  (–2) = – 8
(–2)4 = 16?
Check it.
Instead of taking a fixed number let us take any integer a as the base, and write the
numbers as,
a × a = a2  (read as ‘a squared’ or ‘a raised to the power 2’)
a × a × a = a3  (read as ‘a cubed’ or ‘a raised to the power 3’)
a × a × a × a = a4 (read as a raised to the power 4 or the 4th power of a)
..............................
a × a × a × a × a × a × a = a7  (read as a raised to the power 7 or the 7th power of a)
and so on.
a × a × a × b × b  can be expressed as a3b2 (read as a cubed b squared)
TRY THESE
EXPONENTS AND POWERS
a × a × b × b × b × b can be expressed as a2b4 (read as a

EXAMPLE 1 Express 256 as a power 2.
SOLUTION
We have 256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2.
So we can say  that 256  = 28
EXAMPLE 2 Which one is greater 23 or 32?
SOLUTION
We have, 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8    and  32  = 3 × 3 = 9.
Since 9 > 8, so, 32 is greater than 23
EXAMPLE 3 Which one is greater 82 or 28?
SOLUTION
82 = 8 × 8 = 64
28  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2  =  256
Clearly,
28 > 82
EXAMPLE 4 Expand a3 b2, a2 b3, b2 a3, b3 a2. Are they all same?
SOLUTION
a3 b2  = a3 × b2
= (a × a × a) × (b × b)
= a × a × a × b × b
a2 b3 = a2 × b3
= a × a × b × b × b
b2 a3 = b2 × a3
= b × b × a × a × a
b3 a2 = b3 × a2
= b × b × b × a × a
Note that in the case of terms a3 b2 and a2 b3 the powers of a and b are different. Thus
a3 b2 and a2 b3 are different.
On the other hand, a3 b2 and b2 a3 are the same, since the powers of a and b in these
two terms are the same. The order of factors does not matter.
Thus, a3 b2 = a3 × b2 = b2 × a3 = b2 a3. Similarly, a2 b3 and b3 a2 are the same.
EXAMPLE 5 Express the following numbers as a product of powers of prime factors:
(i) 72
(ii) 432
(iii) 1000
(iv) 16000
SOLUTION
72 = 2 × 36 = 2 × 2 × 18
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 9
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 23 × 32
Thus, 72 = 23 × 32

= 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 27 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 9

(iii) 1000 = 2 × 500 = 2 × 2 × 250 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 125
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 25 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5
1000 = 23 × 53
Atul wants to solve this example in another way:
1000 = 10 × 100 = 10 × 10 × 10
=  (2 × 5) × (2 × 5) × (2 × 5)
(Since10 = 2 × 5)
= 2 × 5 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5
1000 =  23 × 53
Is Atul’s method correct?
(iv) 16,000 =  16 × 1000  =  (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) ×1000 = 24 ×103 (as 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2)
= (2 × 2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5) = 24 × 23 × 53
(Since 1000 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5)
= (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 ) × (5 × 5 × 5)
16,000 = 27 × 53
EXAMPLE 6 Work out (1)5, (–1)3, (–1)4, (–10)3, (–5)4.

13.3.1  Multiplying Powers with the Same Base
(i) Let us calculate 22 × 23
22 × 23 = (2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2)
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 25 = 22+3
Note that the base in 22 and 23 is same and the sum of the exponents, i.e., 2 and 3 is 5
(ii) (–3)4 × (–3)3 = [(–3) × (–3) × (–3)× (–3)]  × [(–3) × (–3) × (–3)]
= (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3) × (–3)
= (–3)7
= (–3)4+3
Again, note that the base is same and the sum of exponents, i.e., 4 and 3, is 7
(iii) a2 × a4 = (a × a) × (a × a × a  × a)
= a × a × a × a × a × a =  a6

Similarly, verify:
42 × 42 = 42+2
32 × 33 = 32+3

am × an = am + n

of 32 is 3. The bases are not same.

37 ÷ 34  =

13.5  DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM
Let us look at the expansion of 47561, which we already know:
47561 = 4 × 10000 + 7 × 1000 + 5 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 1
We can express it using powers of 10 in the exponent form:
Therefore,
47561 = 4 × 104 + 7 × 103 + 5 × 102 + 6 × 101 + 1 × 100
(Note 10,000 = 104, 1000 = 103, 100 = 102, 10 = 101 and 1 = 100)
Let us expand another number:
104278 = 1 × 100,000 + 0 × 10,000 + 4 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 × 1
= 1 × 105 + 0 × 104 + 4 × 103 + 2 × 102 + 7 × 101 + 8 × 100
= 1 × 105 + 4 × 103 + 2 × 102 + 7 × 101 + 8 × 100
Notice how the exponents of 10 start from a maximum value of 5 and go  on decreasing
by 1 at a step from the left to the right upto 0.
13.6  EXPRESSING LARGE NUMBERS IN THE STANDARD FORM
Let us now go back to the beginning of the chapter. We said that large numbers can be
conveniently expressed using exponents. We have not as yet shown this. We shall do so now.
1. Sun is located 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way
Galaxy.
2. Number of stars in our Galaxy is 100,000,000,000.
3. Mass of the Earth is 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg.
These numbers are not convenient to write and read. To make it convenient
we use powers.
Observe the following:
59 = 5.9 × 10 = 5.9 × 101
590 = 5.9 × 100 = 5.9 × 102
5900 = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103
5900 = 5.9 × 10000 = 5.9 × 104  and so on.
TRY THESE
Expand by expressing
powers of 10 in the
exponential form:
(i) 172
(ii) 5,643
(iii) 56,439
(iv) 1,76,428
MATHEMATICS
We have expressed all these numbers in the standard form. Any number can be
expressed as a decimal number between 1.0 and 10.0 including 1.0 multiplied by a power
of 10. Such a form of a number is called its standard form. Thus,
5,985 = 5.985 × 1,000 = 5.985 × 103  is the standard form of 5,985.
Note, 5,985 can also be expressed as 59.85 × 100 or 59.85 × 102. But these are  not
the standard forms, of 5,985. Similarly, 5,985 = 0.5985 × 10,000 = 0.5985 × 104 is also
not the standard form of 5,985.
We are now ready to express the large numbers we came across at the beginning of
the chapter in this form.
The, distance of Sun from the centre of our Galaxy  i.e.,
300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m  can be written as
3.0 × 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 3.0 × 1020 m
Now, can you express 40,000,000,000 in the similar way?
Count the number of zeros in it. It is 10.
40,000,000,000 = 4.0 × 1010
Mass of the Earth = 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg
= 5.976 × 1024 kg
Do you agree with the fact, that the number when written in the standard form is much
easier to read, understand and compare than when the number is written with 25 digits?
Mass of Uranus = 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg
= 8.68 × 1025 kg
Simply by comparing the powers of 10 in the above two, you can tell that the mass of
Uranus is greater than that of the Earth.
The distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m or 1.4335 × 1012 m.
The distance betwen Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m  or 1.439 × 1012 m.  The
distance between Sun and Earth is 149, 600,000,000 m or 1.496 × 1011m.
Can you tell which of the three distances is smallest?
EXAMPLE 13 Express the following numbers in the standard form:
(i) 5985.3
(ii) 65,950
(iii) 3,430,000
(iv) 70,040,000,000
SOLUTION
(i) 5985.3 = 5.9853 × 1000 = 5.9853 × 103
(ii) 65,950 = 6.595 × 10,000 = 6.595 × 104
(iii) 3,430,000 = 3.43 × 1,000,000 = 3.43 × 106
(iv) 70,040,000,000 = 7.004 × 10,000,000,000 = 7.004 × 1010
EXPONENTS AND POWERS
A point to remember is that one less than the digit count (number of digits) to the left
of the decimal point in a given number is the exponent of 10 in the standard form. Thus, in
70,040,000,000 there is no decimal point shown; we assume it to be at the (right) end.
From there, the count of the places (digits) to the left is 11. The exponent of 10 in the
standard form is 11 – 1 = 10. In 5985.3 there are 4 digits to the left of the decimal point
and hence the exponent of 10 in the standard form is 4 – 1 = 3.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Very large numbers are difficult to read, understand, compare and operate upon. To
make all these easier, we use exponents, converting many of the large numbers in a
shorter form.
2. The following are exponential forms of some numbers?
10,000 = 104 (read as 10 raised to 4)
243 = 35,
128 = 27.
Here, 10, 3 and 2 are the bases, whereas 4, 5 and 7 are their respective exponents.
We also say, 10,000 is the 4th power of 10, 243 is the 5th power of 3, etc.
3. Numbers in exponential form obey certain laws, which are:
For any non-zero integers a and b and whole numbers m and n,
(a) am × an = am + n
(b) am ÷ an = am – n,
m > n
(c) (am)n = amn
(d) am × bm = (ab)m
(e) am ÷ bn =
(f) a0 = 1
(g) (–1)even number = 1
(–1)odd number = – 1
SYMMETRY
14.1  INTRODUCTION
Symmetry is an important geometrical concept, commonly exhibited in nature and is used
almost in every field of activity.  Artists, professionals, designers of clothing or jewellery, car
manufacturers, architects and many others make use of the idea of symmetry.  The beehives,
the flowers, the tree-leaves, religious symbols, rugs, and handkerchiefs — everywhere you
find symmetrical designs.
You have already had a ‘feel’ of line symmetry in your previous class.
A figure has a line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded so that
the two parts of the figure will coincide.
You might like to recall these ideas.  Here are some activities to help you.

MATHEMATICS
Enjoy identifying lines (also called axes) of symmetry in the designs you collect.
Let us now strengthen our ideas on symmetry further.  Study the following figures in
which the lines of symmetry are marked with dotted lines. [Fig 14.1 (i) to (iv)]
14.2  LINES OF SYMMETRY FOR REGULAR POLYGONS
You know that a polygon is a closed figure made of several line segments.  The polygon
made up of the least number of line segments is the triangle. (Can there be a polygon that
you can draw with still fewer line segments? Think about it).
A polygon is said to be regular if all its sides are of equal length and all its angles are of
equal measure. Thus, an equilateral triangle is a regular polygon of three sides. Can you
name the regular polygon of four sides?
An equilateral triangle is regular because each of its sides has same length and each of
its angles measures 60° (Fig 14.2).
A square is also regular because all its sides are of equal length and each of its angles
is a right angle (i.e., 90°).  Its diagonals are seen to be perpendicular bisectors of one
another (Fig 14.3).
Fig 14.1
(iii)
Fig 14.2
Fig 14.3
SYMMETRY
If a pentagon is regular, naturally, its sides should have equal length. You will, later on,
learn that the measure of each of its  angles is 108° (Fig 14.4).
A regular hexagon has all its sides equal and each of its angles measures
120°. You will learn more of these figures later (Fig 14.5).
The regular polygons are symmetrical figures and hence their lines of
symmetry are quite interesting,
Each regular polygon has as many lines of symmetry as it has sides [Fig 14.6 (i) - (iv)].
We say, they have multiple lines of symmetry.
Perhaps, you might like to investigate this by paper folding. Go ahead!
The concept of line symmetry is closely related to mirror reflection.  A shape has line
symmetry when one half of it is the mirror image of the other half (Fig 14.7). A mirror line,
thus, helps to visualise a line of symmetry (Fig 14.8).
Is the dotted line a mirror line? No.
Is the dotted line a mirror line? Yes.
Fig 14.8
Fig 14.4

MATHEMATICS
While dealing with mirror reflection, care is needed to note down the left-right changes
in the orientation, as seen in the figure here (Fig 14.9).
The shape is same, but the other way round!
Play this punching game!
Fold a sheet into two halves
Punch a hole
two holes about the
symmetric fold.

The fold is a line (or axis) of symmetry.  Study about punches at different locations on
the folded paper and the corresponding lines of symmetry (Fig 14.10).
EXERCISE 14.1
1. Copy the figures with punched holes and find the axes of symmetry for the following:

SYMMETRY
2. Given the line(s) of symmetry, find the other hole(s):
3. In the following figures, the mirror line (i.e., the line of symmetry) is given as a dotted
line. Complete each figure performing reflection in the dotted (mirror) line. (You might
perhaps place a mirror along the dotted line and look into the mirror for the image).
Are you able to recall the name of the figure you complete?
4. The following figures have more than one line of symmetry.  Such figures are said to
have multiple lines of symmetry.
Identify multiple lines of symmetry, if any, in each of the following figures:
MATHEMATICS
5. Copy the figure given here.
Take any one diagonal as a line of symmetry and shade a few more squares to make
the figure symmetric about a diagonal. Is there more than one way to do that? Will
the figure be symmetric about both the diagonals?
6. Copy the diagram and complete each shape to be symmetric about the mirror line(s):
7. State the number of lines of symmetry for the following figures:
(a) An equilateral triangle (b) An isosceles triangle
(c) A scalene triangle
(d) A square
(e) A rectangle
(f) A rhombus
(g) A parallelogram
(h) A quadrilateral
(i) A regular hexagon
(j) A circle
8. What letters of the English alphabet have reflectional symmetry (i.e., symmetry related
to mirror reflection) about.
(a) a vertical mirror
(b) a horizontal mirror
(c) both horizontal and vertical mirrors
9. Give three examples of shapes with no line of symmetry.
10. What other name can you give to the line of symmetry of
(a) an isosceles triangle? (b) a circle?
14.3  ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY
What do you say when the hands of a clock go round?
You say that they rotate. The hands of a clock rotate in only
one direction, about a fixed point, the centre of the clock-face.
Rotation, like movement of the hands of a clock, is called
a clockwise rotation; otherwise it is said to be anticlockwise.
SYMMETRY
What can you say about the rotation of the blades of a ceiling fan?  Do they rotate
clockwise or anticlockwise? Or do they rotate both ways?
If you spin the wheel of a bicycle, it rotates.  It can rotate in either way: both clockwise
and anticlockwise. Give three examples each for (i) a clockwise rotation and (ii) anticlockwise
rotation.
When an object rotates, its shape and size do not change.  The rotation turns an object
about a fixed point.  This fixed point is the centre of rotation. What is the centre of
rotation of the hands of a clock?  Think about it.
The angle of turning during rotation is called the angle of rotation. A full
turn, you know, means a rotation of 360°.  What is the degree measure of
the angle of rotation for (i) a half-turn? (ii) a quarter-turn?
A half-turn means rotation by 180°; a quarter-turn is rotation by 90°.
When it is 12 O’clock, the hands of a clock are together. By 3 O’clock,
the minute hand would have made three complete turns; but the hour hand
would have made only a quarter-turn.  What can you say about their positions
at 6 O’clock?
Have you ever made a paper windmill? The Paper windmill in the picture
looks symmetrical (Fig 14.11); but you do not find any line of symmetry. No
folding can help you to have coincident halves. However if you rotate it by
90° about the fixed point, the windmill will look exactly the same. We say the
windmill has a rotational symmetry.
Fig 14.12
In a full turn, there are precisely four positions (on rotation through the angles 90°,
180°, 270° and 360°) when the windmill looks exactly the same. Because of this, we say
it has a rotational symmetry of order 4.
Here is one more example for rotational symmetry.
Consider a square with P as one of its corners (Fig 14.13).
Let us perform quarter-turns about the centre of the square marked .
Fig 14.13
Fig 14.11
(iii)
MATHEMATICS
Fig 14.13 (i) is the initial position. Rotation by 90° about the centre leads
to Fig 14.13 (ii). Note the position of P now. Rotate again through 90° and you get
Fig 14.13 (iii). In this way, when you complete four quarter-turns, the square reaches its
original position. It now looks the same as Fig14.13 (i). This can be seen with the help of
the positions taken by P.
Thus a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4 about its centre. Observe that
in this case,
(i) The centre of rotation is the centre of the square.
(ii) The angle of rotation is 90°.
(iii) The direction of rotation is clockwise.
(iv) The order of rotational symmetry is 4.
1. (a) Can you now tell the order of the rotational symmetry for an equilateral triangle?
(Fig 14.14)
Fig 14.14
(b) How many positions are there at which the triangle looks exactly the same,
when rotated about its centre by 120°?
2. Which of the following shapes (Fig 14.15) have rotational symmetry about the marked
point.
(iii)
Fig 14.15
Draw two identical parallelograms, one-ABCD on a piece of paper and the other
A' B' C' D' on a transparent sheet. Mark the points of intersection of their diagonals,
O and O' respectively (Fig 14.16).
Place the parallelograms such that A' lies on A, B' lies on B and so on.  O' then falls
on O.
TRY THESE
(iii)
DO THIS
SYMMETRY
Stick a pin into the shapes at the point O.
Now turn the transparent shape in the clockwise direction.
How many times do the shapes coincide in one full round?
What is the order of rotational symmetry?
The point where we have the pin is the centre of rotation.  It is the
intersecting point of the diagonals in this case.
Every object has a rotational symmetry of order 1, as it occupies
same position after a rotation of 360° (i.e., one complete revolution).
Such cases have no interest for us.
You have around you many shapes, which possess rotational symmetry
(Fig 14.17).
Fruit
Road sign
Wheel

Fig 14.17
For example, when you slice certain fruits, the cross-sections are shapes with rotational
symmetry. This might surprise you when you notice them [Fig 14.17(i)].
Then there are many road signs that exhibit rotational symmetry. Next time when you
walk along a busy road, try to identify such road signs and find about the order of rotational
symmetry [Fig 14.17(ii)].
Think of some more examples for rotational symmetry. Discuss in each case:
(i) the centre of rotation
(ii) the angle of rotation
(iii) the direction in which the rotation is affected and
(iv) the order of the rotational symmetry.
Give the order of the rotational symmetry of the given figures about the point
marked  (Fig 14.17).

14.4  LINE SYMMETRY AND ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY
You have been observing many shapes and their symmetries so far.  By now you
would have understood that some shapes have only line symmetry, some have only
rotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational symmetry.
For example, consider the square shape (Fig 14.19).
How many lines of symmetry does it have?
Does it have any rotational symmetry?
If ‘yes’, what is the order of the rotational symmetry?
Think about it.
The circle is the most perfect symmetrical figure, because it can be rotated around
its centre through any angle and at the same time it has unlimited number of lines
of symmetry. Observe any circle pattern. Every line
through the centre (that is every diameter) forms a
line of (reflectional) symmetry and it has rotational
symmetry around the centre for every angle.

Some of the English alphabets have  fascinating symmetrical structures.Which capital
letters have just one line of symmetry (like E)? Which capital letters have a rotational
symmetry of order 2 (like I)?

position. At what other angles will this happen for the figure?
7. Can we have a rotational symmetry of order more than 1 whose angle of rotation is
(i) 45°?
(ii) 17°?
WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. A figure has line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded so
that the two parts of the figure will coincide.
2. Regular polygons have equal sides and equal angles. They have multiple (i.e., more
than one) lines of symmetry.
3. Each regular polygon has as many lines of symmetry as it has sides.

4. Mirror reflection leads to symmetry, under which the left-right orientation have to be
taken care of.
5. Rotation turns an object about a fixed point.
This fixed point is the centre of rotation.
The angle by which the object rotates is the angle of rotation.
A half-turn means rotation by 180o; a quarter-turn means rotation by 90o.  Rotation
may be clockwise or anticlockwise.
6. If, after a rotation, an object looks exactly the same, we say that it has a rotational
symmetry.
7. In a complete turn (of 360o), the number of times an object looks exactly the same is
called the order of rotational symmetry. The order of symmetry of a square, for
example, is 4 while, for an equilateral triangle, it is 3.
8. Some shapes have only one line of symmetry, like the letter E; some have only rotational
symmetry, like the letter S; and some have both symmetries like the letter H.
The study of symmetry is important because of its frequent use in day-to-day life and
more because of the beautiful designs it can provide us.
VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES
15.1  INTRODUCTION: PLANE FIGURES AND SOLID SHAPES
In this chapter, you will classify figures you have seen in terms of what is known as dimension.
In our day to day life, we see several objects like books, balls, ice-cream cones etc.,
around us which have different shapes. One thing common about most of these objects is that
they all have some length, breadth and height or depth.
That is, they all occupy space and have three dimensions.
Hence, they are called three dimensional shapes.
Do you remember some of the three dimensional shapes (i.e., solid shapes) we have seen
in earlier classes?
Match the shape with the name:

Try to identify some objects shaped like each of these.
By a similar argument, we can say figures drawn on paper which have only length and
breadth are called two dimensional (i.e., plane) figures. We have also seen some two
dimensional figures in the earlier classes.
Match the 2 dimensional figures with the names (Fig 15.2):
(a) Circle
(b) Rectangle
(iii)
(c) Square
(d) Quadrilateral
(e) Triangle

Note: We can write 2-D in short for 2-dimension and 3-D in short for
3-dimension.
15.2  FACES, EDGES AND VERTICES
Do you remember the Faces, Vertices and Edges of solid shapes, which you studied
earlier?  Here you see them for a cube:
(iii)
Fig 15.3
The 8 corners of the cube are its vertices. The 12 line segments that form the
skeleton of the cube are its edges. The 6 flat square surfaces that are the skin of the
cube are its faces.
VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES
Complete the following table:
Table 15.1
Can you see that, the two dimensional figures can be identified as the faces of the
three dimensional shapes?  For example a cylinder
has two faces which are circles,
and a pyramid, shaped like this
has triangles as its faces.
We will now try to see how some of these 3-D shapes can be visualised on a 2-D
surface, that is, on paper.
In order to do this, we would like to get familiar with three dimensional objects closely.
Let us try forming these objects by making what are called nets.
15.3  NETS FOR BUILDING 3-D SHAPES
Take a cardboard box.  Cut the edges to lay the box flat.  You have now a net for that box.
A net is a sort of skeleton-outline in 2-D [Fig154 (i)], which, when folded [Fig154 (ii)],
results in a 3-D shape [Fig154 (iii)].

Here you got a net by suitably separating the edges. Is the
reverse process possible?
Here is a net pattern for a box (Fig 15.5). Copy an enlarged
version of the net and try to make the box by suitably folding
and gluing together. (You may use suitable units). The box is a
solid. It is a 3-D object with the shape of a cuboid.
Similarly, you can get a net for a cone by cutting a slit along
its slant surface (Fig 15.6).
You have different nets for different
shapes.  Copy enlarged versions of the nets
given (Fig 15.7) and try to make the 3-D shapes
indicated. (You may also like to prepare
skeleton models using strips of cardboard
fastened with paper clips).
Fig 15.7
We could also try to make a net for making a pyramid like the Great Pyramid in Giza
(Egypt) (Fig 15.8). That pyramid has a square base and triangles on the four sides.
See if you can make it with the given net (Fig 15.9).

opposite faces should total to 7.

Play this game
You and your friend sit back-to-back. One of you reads out a net to make a 3-D shape,
while the other attempts to copy it and sketch or build the described 3-D object.
15.4  DRAWING SOLIDS ON A FLAT SURFACE
Your drawing surface is paper, which is flat. When you draw a solid shape, the images are
somewhat distorted to make them appear three-dimensional. It is a visual illusion. You will
find here two techniques to help you.
15.4.1  Oblique Sketches
Here is a picture of a cube (Fig 15.11). It gives a clear idea of how the cube looks like,
when seen from the front. You do not see certain faces. In the drawn picture, the lengths
Fig 15.11
VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES
are not equal, as they should be in a cube. Still, you are able to recognise it as a cube. Such
a sketch of a solid is called an oblique sketch.
How can you draw such sketches? Let us attempt to learn the technique.
You need a squared (lines or dots) paper.  Initially practising to draw on these sheets will
later make it easy to sketch them on a plain sheet (without the aid of squared lines or dots!)
Let us attempt to draw an oblique sketch of a 3 × 3 × 3 (each edge is 3 units) cube (Fig 15.12).
Step 1
Step 2
Draw the front face.
Draw the opposite face. Sizes of the
faces have to be same, but the sketch
is somewhat off-set from step 1.
Step 3
Step 4
Join the corresponding corners
Redraw using dotted lines for
hidden edges. (It is a convention)
The sketch is ready now.
Fig 15.12
In the oblique sketch above, did you note the following?
(i) The sizes of the front faces and its opposite are same; and
(ii) The edges, which are all equal in a cube, appear so in the sketch, though the actual
measures of edges are not taken so.
You could now try to make an oblique sketch of a cuboid (remember the faces in this
case are rectangles)
Note: You can draw sketches in which measurements also agree with those of a given
solid. To do this we need what is known as an isometric sheet. Let us try to
MATHEMATICS
make a cuboid with dimensions 4 cm length, 3 cm breadth and 3 cm height on
given isometric sheet.
15.4.2  Isometric Sketches
Have you seen an isometric dot sheet? (A sample is given at the end of the book). Such a
sheet divides the paper into small equilateral triangles made up of dots or lines. To draw
sketches in which measurements also agree with those of the solid, we can use isometric
dot sheets. [Given on inside of the back cover (3rd cover page).]
Let us attempt to draw an isometric sketch of a cuboid of dimensions 4 × 3 × 3 (which
means the edges forming length, breadth and height are 4, 3, 3 units respectively) (Fig 15.13).
Step 1
Step 2

of the cuboid.
Fig 15.13
Note that the measurements are of exact size in an isometric
sketch; this is not so in the case of an oblique sketch.
EXAMPLE 1 Here is an oblique sketch of a cuboid [Fig 15.14(i)].
Draw an isometric sketch that matches this
drawing.
SOLUTION
Here is the solution [Fig 15.14(ii)]. Note how the
measurements are taken care of.

given shapes:

2. The dimensions of a cuboid are 5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm.  Draw three different isometric
sketches of this cuboid.

5. Give (i) an oblique sketch and (ii) an isometric sketch for each of the following:
(a) A cuboid of dimensions 5 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm.  (Is your sketch unique?)
(b) A cube with an edge 4 cm long.
An isometric sheet is attached at the end of the book. You could try to make on it some
cubes or cuboids of dimensions specified by your friend.
15.4.3  Visualising Solid Objects
Sometimes when you look at combined shapes, some of them may be hidden from
your view.
Here are some activities you could try in your free time to help you visualise some solid
objects and how they look. Take some cubes and arrange them as shown in
Fig 15.16.

Now ask your friend to guess how many cubes there are when observed from the
view shown by the arrow mark.
Try to guess the number of cubes in the following arrangements (Fig 15.17).

VISUALISING SOLID SHAPES
Such visualisation is very helpful. Suppose you form a cuboid by joining such cubes.
You will be able to guess what the length, breadth and height of the cuboid would be.
EXAMPLE 2 If two cubes of dimensions 2 cm by 2cm by 2cm are
placed side by side, what would the dimensions of the
resulting cuboid be?
SOLUTION
As you can see (Fig 15.18) when kept side by side, the
length is the only measurement which increases, it becomes
2 + 2 = 4 cm.
The breadth = 2 cm and the height = 2 cm.
1. Two dice are placed side by side as shown: Can you say what the total
would be on the face opposite to
(a) 5 + 6
(b) 4 + 3
(Remember that in a die sum of numbers on opposite faces is 7)
2. Three cubes each with 2 cm edge are placed side by side to form a cuboid. Try to
make an oblique sketch and say what could be its length, breadth and height.
15.5  VIEWING DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF A SOLID
Now let us see how an object which is in 3-D can be viewed in different ways.
15.5.1 One Way to View an Object is by Cutting or Slicing
Slicing game
Here is a loaf of bread (Fig 15.20).  It is like a cuboid with a square face. You  ‘slice’ it with
a knife.
When you give a ‘vertical’ cut, you get several pieces, as shown in the
Figure 15.20.   Each face of the piece is a square!  We call this face a
‘cross-section’ of the whole bread.  The cross section is nearly a square
in this case.
Beware! If your cut is not ‘vertical’ you may get a different cross
section! Think about it. The boundary of the cross-section you obtain is a
plane curve.  Do you notice it?
A kitchen play
Have you noticed cross-sections of some vegetables when they are cut for the purposes
of cooking in the kitchen?  Observe the various slices and get aware of the shapes that
result as cross-sections.

EXERCISE 15.3
1. What cross-sections do you get when you give a
(i) vertical cut
(ii) horizontal cut
to the following solids?
(a) A brick
(b) A round apple
(c) A die
(d) A circular pipe
(e) An ice cream cone
15.5.2  Another Way is by Shadow Play
A shadow play
Shadows are a good way to illustrate how three-dimensional objects can be viewed in two
dimensions. Have you seen a shadow play? It is a form of   entertainment using solid
articulated figures in front of an illuminated back-drop to create the illusion of moving
images.  It makes some indirect use of ideas in Mathematics.
You will need a source of light and a few solid shapes for this activity. (If
you have an overhead projector, place the solid under the lamp and do these
investigations.)
Keep a torchlight, right in front of a Cone. What type of
shadow does it cast on the screen? (Fig 15.23)
The solid is three-dimensional; what is the dimension of the shadow?
If, instead of a cone, you place a cube in the above game, what type of
shadow will you get?
Experiment with different positions of the source of light and with different
positions of the solid object. Study their effects on the shapes and sizes of the
shadows you get.
Here is another funny experiment that you might have tried already:
Place a circular plate in the open when the Sun at the noon time is just right
above it as shown in Fig 15.24 (i). What is the shadow that you obtain?

Will it be same during
(a)   forenoons?
(b)   evenings?

Study the shadows in relation to the position of the Sun and the time of observation.
EXERCISE 15.4
1. A bulb is kept burning just right above the following solids.  Name the shape of the
shadows obtained in each case.  Attempt to give a rough sketch of the shadow.
(You may try to experiment first and then answer these questions).
A ball
A cylindrical pipe
A book

2. Here are the shadows of some 3-D objects, when seen under the lamp of an overhead
projector.  Identify the solid(s) that match each shadow. (There may be multiple
answers for these!)
A circle
A square
A triangle
A rectangle

3. Examine if the following are true statements:
(i) The cube can cast a shadow in the shape of a rectangle.
(ii) The cube can cast a shadow in the shape of a hexagon.
15.5.3 A Third Way is by Looking at it from Certain Angles
to Get Different Views
One can look at an object standing in front of it or by the side of it or from above. Each
time one will get a different view (Fig 15.25).
Fig 15.25
Here is an example of how one gets different views of a given building. (Fig 15.26)

You could do this for figures made by joining cubes.

corresponding top, front and side views.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. The circle, the square, the rectangle, the quadrilateral and the triangle are examples
of plane figures; the cube, the cuboid, the sphere, the cylinder, the cone and the
pyramid are examples of solid shapes.
2. Plane figures are of two-dimensions (2-D) and the solid shapes are of
three-dimensions (3-D).
3. The corners of a solid shape are called its vertices; the line segments of its skeleton
are its edges; and its flat surfaces are its faces.
4. A net is a skeleton-outline of a solid that can be folded to make it.  The same solid
can have several types of nets.
5. Solid shapes can be drawn on a flat surface (like paper) realistically. We call this
2-D representation of a 3-D solid.
6. Two types of sketches of a solid are possible:
(a) An oblique sketch does not have proportional lengths. Still it conveys all important
aspects of the appearance of the solid.
(b) An isometric sketch is drawn on an isometric dot paper, a sample of which is
given at the end of this book.  In an isometric sketch of the solid the measurements
kept proportional.
7. Visualising solid shapes is a very useful skill.  You should be able to see ‘hidden’
parts of the solid shape.
8. Different sections of a solid can be viewed in many ways:
(a) One way is to view by cutting or slicing the shape, which would result in the
cross-section of the solid.
(b) Another way is by observing a 2-D shadow of a 3-D shape.
(c) A third way is to look at the shape from different angles; the front-view, the
side-view and the top-view can provide a lot of information about the shape
observed.
